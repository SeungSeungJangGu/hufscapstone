ABSTRACT

Steam, Apple and Google have created convenient ways for users to
find and install software by means of important advances in digital
content delivery — commonly expressed to end-users as “app stores.”

The success of these platforms over the past 10 years has meant that
users have grown to expect and demand the kind of ease-of-use and
seamless purchasing experience that these platforms provide.

However, this success has also produced a number of challenges for
the industry. These include:

1. Monopoly

Developers are increasingly having a hard time selling their software
outside of these walled gardens which result in large commission fees
and loss of control over their own customers.

2. Discovery Failure
As the catalog of games continues to grow, gamers are having a
harder time discovering the right kind of content.

3. Missed Opportunities

The relatively new phenomena of streamers and gaming influencers
has created a new opportunity for game marketplaces to reward and
pay users for their play time.

This White Paper sets out to explain not only the problem faced by
Players & Developers today but also how Ultra is best positioned with a
solution.
INDUSTRY VOICES

The game market system is pretty
unfair. Most of the money made goes
to middlemen: app stores, social
networks. This is broken.

We should not accept this as a status
quo. We should constantly be on
lookout for better solutions.

Founder of EPIC games

OVERVIEW

88% of the PC game market is untapped and
developers continue to move away from “app stores”

These are developers who don't agree with Steam's heavy 30% revenue
share or desire to have more control over their user-base.

However, game developers outside of Steam are falling short in
delivering a fully fledged user experience on their custom platforms.

Digital distribution has encouraged and enabled a wide range of indie
developers to enter the market by reducing distribution costs related to
physical packaging and shipping logistics.

However, the resulting influx is now forcing developers to spend large
amounts of money on advertising to stay relevant.
GAMER POPULATION ON CONSTANT RISE

Nearly 1 in 3 people on earth are now playing video games. That's 2.1
billion individuals playing at least once a month.

The average profile of a PC gamer is 35 years-old, playing for 13 years
and has strong purchasing power.

GLOBAL AD REVENUE IS GROWING

Gamers represent a highly valuable demographic that has always been
hard to reach - mostly because they have abandoned traditional media.

Word-of-mouth, YouTubers, live streamers, and other new channels are
how most of these customers make their purchase decisions.

OVERVIEW

Ultra is building a first-class PC game publishing
platform and marketplace that puts an end to
the current distribution monopoly.

Specifically, Ultra will:

Be More Fair to Developers
Developers earn +21% more sales revenue with an instant payout

Provide Effective Marketing Tools
Developers get access to a range of new business and marketing tools

Introduce New Revenue Streams
Developers and gamers will have access to a range of new revenue
opportunities

Establish a Rich Token Based Economy
Powering referral bonuses, digital goods, rewards programs and more

Be Backed by Industry Leaders
The team behind Ultra has a long history in the game industry and its
high-end relationships network spans the globe
WHY NOW?

A number of key industry trends are converging to make
the development of a breakthrough game distribution
platform possible.

Frustration with Incumbents

Ultra provides developers the unique flexibility of a custom-built platform
without the need to invest millions of dollars and years of research,
development, and maintenance.

Blockchain Economics

Blockchain makes it possible to process nano-payments instantly, proof of
ownership, transaction transparency and a myriad of other features that
allow Ultra to provide more control and better deals to developers while also
bringing exciting innovations and financial incentives to players.

Developer Innovation

With a thriving indie and AAA development ecosystem, there's never been a
better and more urgent time for a platform to provide new opportunities and
differentiation. Ultra is not just a storefront for games, it's a full ecosystem
that developers can leverage to bolster their business. Ultra can
accommodate many different business strategies for all developers. Whether
they are industry giants or indies, publish Free-to-play or Premium games,
eSports or single-player games, Ultra fits 100% of the PC games distribution
market but also caters to side markets such as item trading, tournaments
etc.

The Right Team
The team gathered to build and operate Ultra is second-to-none.
Bringing these people together, now, positions us to drive disruptive change.

ADS TECHNOLOGY

Our Ad Technology
Already battle-tested, our technology currently serves 33 billion daily ads

This technology combined with our extensive industry experience enables
marketing tools that efficiently promote games, differentiating Ultra from
other platforms

Developers and advertisers can bring an end to non-optimal “spray and
pray” advertising methods

Ultra Ads has 3 Main Objectives

Enable content publishers to promote their products more efficiently
Empower developers to instantly run new ads using Ultra Coins earned
from sales

Allow users to effortlessly earn Ultra Coins by opting into the Ultra Ads
revenue share program

Opt-in Ad Revenue Share Program

Our opt-in system allows users to authorize ads and receive a share of the
revenue. This revenue is automatically deposited in their Ultra coin wallet.

Every user has the option to either accept or refuse advertisements in Ultra.
Ads are displayed in several areas:

Before the launch of game

After a game is closed

In-browser notifications

When the mobile app ‘Ultra Go’ is launched.
AD SSP TECHNOLOGY

Ultra Ads has a DSP (Demand-Side Platform)

Our DSP owns the Advertiser contracts and the Ad Exchange contracts.
Ultra's DSP provides them the ability to buy Ultra’s ad traffic.

Additionally, the DSP gets traffic from the SSP (Server-Side Platform) / Ad
Exchange.

Our DSP takes a small % of the service charge from Ad Agencies and
Advertisers.

The DSPs allows advertisers to buy impressions from a wide range of
publisher sites that are targeting specific users based on criteria Such as
location age, gender, hobbies, etc.

Our DSP ‘plugs in’ to any typical ad exchange marketplace where publishers
make their ad inventory available to Ultra.

We analyze the impressions SSPs put out and purchase on behalf of
advertisers automatically.

The price of ads fluctuates depending on the target user demographics,
demand, and traffic availability, each transaction is settled using UOS token.

Ultra Ads has a DSP (Demand-Side Platform)

Ultra’s SSP is used to automate the sale of our advertising space and
inventory.

While a DSP is used by marketers to buy ad impressions from ad
exchanges as cheaply and efficiently as possible, the SSP is designed for
publishers to maximize the price they sell impressions at. They're both
powered by similar technology but operate at the opposite side of the table.

Ultra’s Ad technology is, therefore, able to both buy traffic externally as well
as sell its internal traffic to external ad exchanges to optimize ad
profitability and performance.

OPEN BLOCKCHAIN FRAMEWORK

Ultra provides a solution which allows anyone to build and operate their own game
distribution platform or virtual goods trading service. These 3rd party services still
require Ultra coins to operate and our core platform features, such as multi-level
referral programs are enforced across all shops through our blockchain.

Ultra's official clients, as well as 3rd party

websites, virtual asset exchanges, and
even unofficial Ultra clients.

POWERED BY ULTRA COINS (UOS TOKENS)

All purchases of games, virtual items, and services on Ultra Games operate
through smart contracts which require Ultra Coins, also called UOS Tokens.

All features on Ultra such as our loyalty programs, beta testing, bug reporting,
trade of digital goods, advertisements etc. work exclusively with UOS Tokens.

To get started, users will be required to acquire coins from other users or
through our fully transparent credit card and payment gateway solutions.

Ultra's Blockchain services are designed to be operated in and outside of
Ultra's official clients. This philosophy opens the door to new business and
revenue streams for 3rd party actors.

In other words, it is possible, through Ultra’s blockchain protocols and APIs, to
purchase and trade games and virtual items through websites, PC and
mobile applications that are not operated by Ultra.
GAME TOKENIZATION

Developers will want to publish content on Ultra in order to gain
access to their own “token factory.” This will allow them to effortlessly
materialize their games into a secure crypto token.

Ultra Coins can be sold through Ultra and, thanks to the decentralized
nature of our tokens, it is also possible to sell them on external
marketplaces.

By owning a token in Ultra’s token wallet, users are able to download
games and get updates the same way content and updates are
downloaded from familiar platforms such as XBOX and Steam.

Unique to Ultra, our convenient UI allows developers
the freedom to customize the services or rights their
token grants to other users.

Notable Game Token Customizations Include

Secondhand market, allowed or not

Sales revenue split with multi-signature

Referral program for UOS tokens

Additional referral program for items

Game access subscription (World of Warcraft style)
Monthly game update subscription
VIRTUAL ITEM TOKENIZATION

Like games, the Ultra platform also makes it possible
to tokenize virtual items and sell them through our
marketplace or through external marketplaces.

Tokens can be configured by the game developer
with the following optional features:

Consumable: the token is destroyed when “used”

Item subscription: the token grants access to the item
during a set period of time

Secondhand market allowed or not
Sales revenue split with multi-signature
SECONDHAND MARKET

Ultra is the first platform to offer a solution for
second-hand games in the mainstream digital
games market.

Developers can give their secondhand games and virtual items new
life and increase their revenue by receiving an additional revenue share
from all secondhand resales.

Secondhand resale functionality is fully blockchain based, optional
and customizable.

For example, it is possible to allow resales only after a certain amount
of time has passed to avoid cannibalizing launch sales revenue.

The Benefits of the Ultra Secondhand Market are Clear

Players re-selling their games are able to earn Ultra Coins, allowing
them to buy more content

Players buying second-hand games have access to content

that may not have been affordable to them at full retail prices
Developers capitalize on an additional revenue stream

We believe that secondhand games sales managed in this way
is a huge opportunity for users and game developers.
2-LEVEL REFERRAL PROGRAM

50% of Ultra’s share of game sales revenue is
redistributed to players and developers that bring new
users to the platform.

Good for Players
Players who invite their friends to the platform will receive Ultra Coins
every time their referees purchase content.

Good for Developers

Game developers are incentivized to direct their marketing efforts
towards Ultra to earn an additional revenue stream from their users’
purchases — even purchases of content from other developers.

RELIABLE CRYPTOCURRENCY CONTENT PRICING

The 14 Million Dollar Pizza

In 2010, it was possible to purchase a pizza with 5,000 Bitcoins.

If the price of this delicious Italian food never adapted to the market, one
of those pizzas today would cost about 30 million dollars.

It is safe to assume that nobody would buy pizzas at that price.

The 1 Dollar Solution
To tackle the UOS Token value fluctuations, content providers
will configure the sales prices of their content in USD.

Ultra will pull the latest USD value of an Ultra Coin from its internal coin
exchange and provide the USD to Ultra Coin conversion rate to smart
contracts, in real time.

In this way, USD prices set by content providers can be converted
in Ultra Coins automatically at purchase time.

In Other Words

An application that costs $50 will always cost $50; however, the amount
of Ultra Coins required to complete the transaction on the blockchain will
fluctuate according to the latest Ultra Coin market price.

HIGH NO
VOLATILITY VOLATILITY

HANDLING TRADITIONAL PAYMENT METHODS

While Ultra’s content marketplace will offer both
Ultra Coin and classic payment options, all transactions
will ultimately be executed using Ultra Coins.

Payments via traditional methods like credit card, PayPal, etc.
are automatically and transparently converted to Ultra Coins
(by purchasing them from coin holders) which are then used
to complete the transaction.

INVESTMENTS

Game Development and Acquisition War Chest
5% of all Ultra’s game sales profits will go to Ultra’s “Game Development
and Acquisition War Chest.” These coins will stay frozen in a smart contract

for a period of at least 2 years.

Unfrozen War Chest coins will be used to acquire new exclusive games and
services for Ultra, bringing even more players to our platform, generating
more profits, redistributing more coins and consequently increasing the
amount of Ultra Coins in the War Chest at each cycle.

While this process, in essence, burns away part of our short-term profit,
it ultimately guarantees the healthy growth of both the user base and
exclusive games.

Coins are released to game studios when they reach their development
milestones.

after the software sale occurs.
PLAYER EARNINGS

One of Ultra’s core user experience philosophies is to
provide players with diverse ways to easily and
instantly earn Ultra Coins.

ULTRA MINER

Ultra Miner — Our Non-Inflationary 1 Button Ultra Coin Mining Solution
Ultra's blockchain technology doesn't require users to use their GPUs to
secure our network. Therefore we are in a position to let them mine other
blockchains. With Ultra Miner, our 1 button smart miner application, mined
altcoins are sold to purchase Ultra Coins from coin holders to ultimately
offer Ultra Coins to our mining users.

Easy Mode is Ultra’s “one button mining” solution that takes care of all
configuration. Ultra Miner supports multiple mining strategies and is
capable of mining different cryptocurrencies. It automatically mines the

most profitable coins at any given time.
CONTENT ACQUISITION

The quantity and the quality of games available on Ultra
will define the pace at which the platform will grow.

With this in mind, we have built a dedicated content acquisition team
comprised of veterans with 20+ years of experience in the field and an
extensive network of relationships.

1. Game Development and Acquisition War Chest

5% of all our sales revenue will be systematically frozen during a period
of 2 years. These funds will be used to support game developers of all
sizes in a range of strategic ways.

2. Established Relationships
We are leveraging our game industry relationships to acquire distribution
rights for games made by acclaimed developers around the globe.

3. Global Evangelism

We will build platform awareness through a broad evangelism program.
The program will include participation in game conventions around the
world such as GDC, E3, ChinaJoy, GamesCom, G-Star, Tokyo Game
Show, etc.

4. Easy Onboarding

We have worked hard to minimize porting and integration efforts for
game developers by providing feature parity, great documentation, and
proactive support.

In addition to Ultra’s universal C++ SDK, we provide ready to use dev kits
for leading 3D engines such as Unity3D, Unreal Engine, CryEngine, and
Lumberyard.
ULTRA GAMES SDK

Platform Porting Made Easy

Developers love platform SDKs because they can spend more time
developing their core application or game features while leaving
low-level plumbing like user authentication, Digital Rights
Management, microtransactions, messaging, leaderboards,
achievements, and so on to other platforms.

The Ultra Games SDK will completely close the gap between legacy
publishing platforms and Ultra by providing all SDK features available

from competing platforms.

In this way, porting an application or game from other platforms to
Ultra will be easy and effective.

9 TACTICS TO BREAK THE MONOPOLY

1. The First Full-Featured Alternative Game Publishing Platform
Ultra is the first platform able to truly compete with Steam by offering
feature parity. For the first time, any game published on Steam can be
ported with minimal effort and no compromises.

2. Better Developer Marketing Tools

Ultra is designed from the ground up to offer effective marketing tools to
promote games in today’s crowded marketplace. Ultra comes with

a deeply integrated ad toolbox that offers new marketing opportunities
tailored for developers. Combined with a modern crowdsourcing
approach made possible by our blockchain technology, we achieve

a true win-win-win situation.

3. Transparent Business Practices

Our trustless business environment is based on blockchain technology
and guarantees impossible sales report tampering. Developers don't have
to trust platforms owners anymore, our decentralized blockchain network
protects them against fraud. Collaborations between developers and
publishers will also benefit from Ultra’s various advanced trustless
features.

4. Faster Payouts

Today’s publishing platforms typically pay out to developers anywhere
between 30 to 60 days after sales. Ultra will offer instant sales payouts.
This also allows developers to drive sales momentum at launch by
reinvesting in marketing campaigns directly from sales — in real-time.

5. Developer-Friendly Practices
Ultra offers developers a larger revenue-share, enhanced data analytics
and enables them to have a direct relationship with their gamers.

shape and define the industry. Who wouldn't want to be a part of Ultra.
DISCLOSURES
DISCLAIMER

This White Paper has been issued by ULTRA Corporation OU (the “Company”) on May the 28th, 2018. This White Paper describes the

Company's business objectives and the generation by the Company of ULTRA tokens, and may not be complete or final.

The purpose of this White Paper is to provide prospective purchasers with the information on the Company's project to allow the
prospective purchasers to make their own decision as to whether or not it wishes to proceed with the purchase of ULTRA tokens. This
White Paper is not intended to be an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any security or other financial instruments. The
offering of ULTRA token has not been registered, qualified, or approved under any securities, futures, financial instruments, capital

markets, or exchange control legislation, regulation, or ordinance of any jurisdiction.

The Company has taken reasonable care to ensure that, as at the date of this White Paper, the information contained herein is
accurate to the best of its knowledge. The information contained in this White Paper may be subject to modification,
supplementation, and amendment at any time and from time to time. The Company does not make any representation or warranty as
to the accuracy or completeness of the information contained in this White Paper and the Company has no obligation to update or

keep current any information or projections contained herein.

The publication of this White Paper and the offering of ULTRA Tokens may be restricted in certain jurisdictions. It is the responsibility
of any person in possession of this White Paper and any persons wishing to make an application for ULTRA Tokens to inform

themselves of, and to observe, any and all laws and regulations that may be applicable to them.

This White Paper does not contain all material information regarding the risks associated with the purchase of digital tokens. The
buying of digital tokens, like the ULTRA tokens, is speculative and involves risks, which you should be understood prior to making your

decision to buy.

Prospective purchasers should only purchase ULTRA tokens if they can afford a complete loss. Unless prospective purchasers fully
understand and accept the nature of and the potential risks inherent in the purchase of ULTRA tokens they should not purchase
ULTRA tokens. Prospective purchasers should conduct independent investigations and analysis regarding the Company, the ULTRA
okens and all other market and economic factors as they deem appropriate to fully evaluate the merits and risks of their purchase.
Prospective purchasers should consult with its own legal, regulatory, tax, business, financial and accounting professional advisors to

he extent that they deem it necessary. Prospective purchasers must determine based on its own independent review and such

professional advice as it deems necessary, if the purchase of the ULTRA tokens is appropriate and suitable for it, notwithstanding the

clear and substantial risks inherent with the purchase of ULTRA tokens.

The purchase of ULTRA tokens is only possible after the prospective purchaser has read, understood and accepted the terms for the
ULTRA token sale (available upon request to the Company). Each prospective purchaser will be required to acknowledge that it made

an independent decision to purchase the ULTRA tokens and that it is not relying, in any manner whatsoever, on the Company, its

board of directors or any other person or entity (other than such purchaser's own advisers).

The Company and its board of directors do not accept any responsibility or liability for any use of this White Paper by any person
which is in breach of any local regulatory requirements with regard to the distribution of this White Paper or any applicable rules

pertaining to the offer of ULTRA tokens.

DISCLOSURES
RISK FACTORS

This section on risk factors is not and does not purport to be a complete enumeration or explanation of the risks involved with the
purchase of ULTRA tokens. There may be additional risks of which the Company is not aware. The following therefore highlights
certain risks to which the Company is subject to and which the Company wishes to encourage prospective purchasers of ULTRA

tokens to discuss with their own professional advisors.

e Risk of software weaknesses. The ULTRA platform and the underlying technology are still in an early development stage

and unproven. There is no warranty that the process for creating the ULTRA Platform will be uninterrupted or error-free and

there is an inherent risk that the software could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs causing, inter alia, the complete

loss of the Tokens.

e —_ Regulatory risk. The blockchain technology allows new forms of interaction and it is possible that certain jurisdictions will
apply existing regulations on, or introduce new securities law, tax or other laws or regulations addressing, blockchain
technology-based applications and/or the issuance and sale of tokens, which may, inter alia, result in substantial
modifications to the sale of ULTRA tokens and/ or the ULTRA platform, including its termination and the loss of all ULTRA

tokens

e Government action. Because of the regulatory uncertainty described above, blockchain activities, including the activities of
the Company, may be subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny, including investigations or enforcement actions. All of
this could subject the Company to judgments, settlements, fines or penalties or require or cause the Company to
restructure its operations and activities, to cease offering certain products or services in one or more jurisdictions or refrain

from delivering the ULTRA tokens to certain persons or in certain jurisdictions.

e Risk of abandonment/lack of success. The creation of the ULTRA tokens and the development of the ULTRA platform may
be abandoned for a number of reasons, including lack of interest from the public, lack of funding, lack of commercial
success or prospects (e.g. caused by competing projects). Also, even if the ULTRA platform is partially or fully developed

and launched, there is no assurance for its future users to use and access the ULTRA platform as anticipated.

e Risk associated with other applications. It is possible that alternative platforms and businesses could be established that

utilize the same open source code and protocol underlying the ULTRA platform. The ULTRA platform may compete with

these alternative platforms and businesses, which could negatively impact the adoption of the ULTRA platform and the

ULTRA tokens. In addition, the ULTRA platform may give rise to other, alternative projects, promoted by unaffiliated third
parties, under which the ULTRA tokens will have reduced, or potentially no, intrinsic value. There is a risk that the Company
or its representatives, or other third parties may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core

infrastructural elements of the ULTRA platform interfering with the use of, or causing the loss of, the ULTRA tokens.

e Risk of theft. The smart contract used to generate the Tokens and the underlying software application may be exposed to

attacks by hackers or other individuals including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks,
consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Any such successful attacks could result in theft or loss of
payments made to the Company and/or the ULTRA tokens, adversely impacting the ability to use or develop the ULTRA

platform and derive any usage or functionality from the ULTRA tokens.

DISCLOSURES
RISK FACTORS

e —ULTRA/Other Blockchain Mining Attacks: As with other cryptocurrencies, the blockchain being used for the ULTRA tokens is
susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks,
“selfish-mining” attacks, and race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the ULTRA tokens and the
ULTRA platform, expected proper execution and sequencing of token transactions, and expected proper execution and

sequencing of contract computations.

e Development Risk: The timing for issuing the ULTRA tokens and for completing various steps in the implementation of the
ULTRA platform are set forth in this Whitepaper. However, there is no assurance that the Company will meet those target
dates. The ULTRA platform operationality may be limited at the time of the ULTRA tokens delivery date and not all of the
anticipated operational features intended for the ULTRA platform may be functioning at that time. The ULTRA platform will
still be subject to ongoing development and could undergo significant changes over time. In addition, because the
development of the ULTRA platform may be depended on third parties, the Company may have limited control over future

ULTRA tokens functionality or in assuring the ongoing operation and performance of the ULTRA platform.

e No Liquidity: ULTRA tokens are not intended for investment purposes. ULTRA tokens holders may not be able to sell,
transfer or trade its unused ULTRA tokens to any other party. ULTRA tokens are intended to be used only in connection with
the ULTRA platform. There may never be a secondary market for the ULTRA tokens. ULTRA tokens may be subject to

significant transfer restrictions as a result of actions taken by the Company or by government regulators.

e Early Stage Companies: The Company is a start-up and has no operating history against which purchasers of the ULTRA
okens may consider the appropriateness of purchasing the ULTRA tokens. Many risks and uncertainties affect start-up and
early-stage companies, which often have very limited operating history, profits or cash flow. There can be no assurance of
he success of such enterprises. Their potential must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties,
complications, and delays frequently encountered in connection with new or developing businesses, including technology
risks, unproven business models, untested plans, uncertain market acceptance, competition and lack of revenues and

financing.

The technological fields and markets that many start-ups and early-stage companies address have undergone and are expected to
continue to undergo rapid and significant change. Rapid technological developments may result in the technology of companies
becoming obsolete, uneconomical or uncompetitive before any commercial success or financial return can be achieved. Numerous
other risks may affect developing companies and ventures, including risks that products or services will be found to be ineffective,
unreliable, unsafe or uncompetitive and risks that such companies’ technologies, products or service will not achieve market
acceptance or penetration. Market acceptance of new products, services or technologies depends on many factors and

uncertainties and cannot be assured.

Startup and early-stage companies may compete with entities that have established businesses, relationships and positions in the
market and that have much more substantial financial, business, technological, marketing and distribution assets, operations and
resources. There can be no assurance that any developing company will be able to compete successfully with more established

companies.
These companies may be overly dependent on the vision, skill, and leadership of a single or limited number of executives. Ina

startup business, the loss or disability of a key person(s) can result in significant financial hardship, in some cases the failure of the

company. More than other businesses, start-ups are highly dependent on the skills and contributions of very few key employees.

DISCLOSURES
RISK FACTORS

Any projections, forecasts, plans or other forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks, uncertainties, changing
circumstances and other factors that could cause actual results, performance, plans, prospects, operations and opportunities to
differ materially from any forward-looking statements, including competition, inability to identify and do business with appropriate
customers, existing and future law and regulations, liabilities under the securities laws, inability to hire, retain or qualify sufficient

management and staff, general economic conditions, rapid technological change, cost overruns, delays in bringing products or

services to market, marketing failures, difficulty in penetrating markets, delays or failures in developing anticipated capabilities,

products or services, failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, insufficient funding, lack of availability of capital, rates of

economic growth, levels of consumer and business spending, conditions in the technology and financial industries, dependence on
strategic partners and business relationships, unproven business models, adverse developments affecting customers and
end-users, fluctuations in securities markets and valuations, limited marketing, expansion risks, losses and costs, uncertain
revenues and profitability, conditions in particular industries, accounting problems, costs, delays and liabilities arising from legal

proceedings, failure to obtain and maintain intellectual property or proprietary rights and management failures.

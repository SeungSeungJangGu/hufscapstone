Introduction

This white paper or LIFE paper sets out the vision for LIFE. With LIFE we aim to build a stable transactional
and reward mechanism that bridges the gap between blockchain and its wide spread adoption. The economic
growth potential for ordinary people adopting cryptocurrency and blockchain based tech is immense.

Our objective is to bring LIFE to the mainstream public by making it accessible and user friendly. Ultimately a
user doesn't really worry how something works they are more concerned that it does work and enables use in
everyday life.

The purpose of this white paper is to provide a written outline of how we anticipate the growth of LIFE, our high
level roadmap and the technical aspects of LIFE.

In keeping with the premise of LIFE ‘Simply, for everyday people’, we aim to make LIFEtoken accessible to the
widest possible market, through adoption and transactional uses.

About LIFElabs.io

We are on the cusp of a ground-breaking digital currency revolution with a seismic shift in technology impacting
every facet of our lives. Blockchain is an increasingly key and beneficial part of this process and we at LIFElabs.io
will bring together the benefits by developing all facets of blockchain to change people's lives.

The LIFElabs.io team and advisers brings together an impressive range of skills and experience and drive to use
and develop existing blockchain based technologies.

LIFE Ecosystem

Since the creation and meteoric rise to fame of Bitcoin (BTC) and subsequent development of Ethereum (ETH),
development of smart contracts, additional blockchains (albeit subsets of the original), bearish investment and
speculative trade has taken place between a relatively small group of investors (some of these being the original
founding community). This has led to speculators moving into the cryptocurrency sphere.

The technical nature of the language used and the perceived complexity of cryptocurrency, has, intentionally or
otherwise, excluded most of the general population from the cryptocurrency community.

Recent articles, both on and offline and the movement by mainstream hedge funds and institutional investors
and their professional advisors into the cryptocurrency sphere have increased the interest of the general
population in this area.

Wide spread adoption of blockchain based business and technology will bring the technology and all its benefits
‘0 the everyday users.

Mainstream adoption benefits not only the newcomers to the crypto sphere, but also the existing
cryptocurrency economy and its current users. Social responsibility and sharing the exposure and benefits. New
erms are coined by members of the political community all the time however with regards to social change

but we are yet to witness anything of substance. LIFE will give everyone the opportunity to change their life for
he better. If an individual can collect 1 LIFE token, they are then part of the crypto sphere. This then gives that
individual an opportunity to gain by further immersing themselves in this brave new world!

LIFE is blockchain based social and financial liberation.
LIFEtoken

token

Overview

LIFE is an ERC20 compliant token on the Ethereum Blockchain. Ethereum offers incredible growth for LIFE and
will enable the token to continue to grow without hinderance.

Supply

The total supply of LIFE is 100 billion tokens. Whilst this appears to be a significantly higher number compared
to the majority of other coin and token issuances, LIFE has many facets.

Smart Bank and blockchain driven user democracy

We aim to build a true people’s bank where the the holder is in control of the token. Every holder of
LIFE can take part in the vote to issue more tokens. Whilst people may question why this is not smart
contract driven, it is simply down to user interaction.

In addition to the ‘token’, LIFE will evolve into a true people's bank providing instant FIAT to crypto
and crypto to FIAT. LIFE bank will not offer loans or overdrafts but will simply allow users to hold their
currency and earn interest. We have a diverse mix of adopters, including a Landlord, a Medical Research
company, a FIAT Exchange and a financial education website. We have agreed to work closely with these
companies as we view them as market leaders in their areas - and they will assist with our vision of bringing
cryptocurrency to everyday people.
Distribution of LIFE

To ensure the longevity of our LIFE project the founders believe that transparency is paramount. We will give
LIFE stakeholders confidence that our integrity is vital and we have set out the allocations and contractual
restrictions below.

Pre-sales (allocation 4.9%)

Purchasers of LIFE during the pre-sale can of course trade LIFE on the open market and trade LIFE on
Cryptosaurus.cc.

Adopters (allocation 35.2%)

The adoption of LIFE by many companies as a reward scheme will allow tokens to be drip fed into the open
market by those who have been rewarded with LIFE.

Cryptosaurus 2%
Moneymindful 1%
Tarian PLC 2%
Pure Living Homes 5%
Fuudel.com 5%
Adopters to be announced 22% (they will announce through their own marketing time line)

Owners and senior management of the adopting entities cannot sell or benefit from the token allocation.

LIFE Foundation and Charity (allocation 2.9% in 2017)

Charities allocated LIFE will be able to draw down token on case by case basis.

LIFE Team and Advisors (allocation 12%)

The team and advisors have been allocated 12% of the total supply. In line with LIFElabs company policy,

no beneficiary of the LIFE token can sell more than 100,000 LIFE at any given time. All stakeholders wallets,
whether in cold storage or not, will be constantly monitored for the overall beneficiaries of LIFE token holders.
LIFE reserved for development and future projects (allocation 3.11%)

This sum is reserved for all normal costs associated with running a company.

A full breakdown of the token allocation can be found on page 14.
LIFE Adopters

We have a diverse mix of adopters, including a Landlord, a Medical Research company, a FIAT Exchange and a
financial education website. We have agreed to work closely with these companies as we view them as market
leaders in their areas - and they will assist with our vision of bringing cryptocurrency to everyday people!

Pure Living Homes Limited

“We are pleased to be adopting LIFE as a tokenised reward for our tenants. We always try
to be different than your average landlord and we look forward to our tenants benefitting
from the blockchain. We are not going to be the only landlord in the UK to adopt LIFE but
we are the first. All our tenants will be rewarded when they; Pay on time, Length of tenure
(how long they have lived with is) and how they look after their home! All tenants will be
given LIFE monthly and we are delighted with the feedback so far.

Money Mindful

Money Mindful is the UK's first free website subscriber site that brings together experts
from around the country (and the world) to help each of us to learn about money; how to
make it, manage it, spend it, pass it on; even what we should be teaching our kids about it.
Money Mindful publishes articles, videos, tips, training and techniques from a selection

of the Nation’s best and brightest experts in the world of Financial Planning, Business
Leadership, Entrepreneurial Creativity, Legal and Tax Advice and Self-Development.

In addition. We will feature the latest time and money-saving ideas, investment
opportunities, and technological advancements designed to make your journey to financial
independence understandable, straightforward and enjoyable.

All our writers are experts in their own field. Their combined business experience can be
measured in millennia.

Cryptosaurus

We are the first “fiat exchange” site in the UK to adopt a cryptocurrency (LIFE) as an
international payment system. Whilst we will remain a site for fiat, we had customers
from parts of the world where their payments did not reach us for 26 days - this is the
most efficient and speedy way of transacting with our customers. In a perfect world we
would like to move away from Fiat - but cryptocurrency is still in its embryotic years and
therefore this is a move in the right direction. Also customer buying with LIFE will not pay
commission! Why? Because it will not cost us ridiculous banking fees.

Tarian PLC

At Tarian, we believe we have the world’s first efficacious Alzheimer’s Disease medication.
Of similar importance, is our decade long track record of absolute safety in treating
individuals

which provides patients with a level of reassurance as yet unheard of in alternative
potential therapies.

Having witnessed first-hand the slowing, stabilising and, in some cases, reversal of
symptoms in Alzheimer’s Disease patients, our primary objective is to make the treatment
available to every individual who is suffering with this relentless condition.

The 50 million sufferers who have received a diagnosis is expected to double over the next
20 years.

To simplify the entry into the cryptocurrency world for inexperienced users, we are developing the LIFEwallet
that has simplicity at its heart. It will have an easyto-understand interface, together with video and text-based
guides to setting up and using the wallet. The timescale for this is currently Q1 2018.

card

LIFEcard

To aid the adoption of cryptocurrency into the mainstream, we need to make the processes of using both FIAT
and Cryptocurrency indistinguishable from each other. To assist with this, the LIFEcard will be a contactless
debit card that carries out crypto-FIAT transactions on, making the process of spending LIFE and other
supported ERC20 compatible currencies indistinguishable from the use of FIAT currency. Our cards are due for
circulation Q1 2018.

The LIFEcard can also be used to reward customers and staff. By loading tokens onto the LIFE card, employers
and businesses can reward good performance, customer loyalty or similar with LIFE. These can then be spent
directly off the card, held or traded as normal cryptocurrency. In addition to this the card will support both
Bitcoin and Ethereum, tripling its utility and optioning to the market.

LIFE Foundation and Charities

A total of 2.929 bn of the total supply of LIFE has been reserved in escrow. These tokens will be released to
nominated charities through smart democracy. Each charity or charitable cause will be driven by its own smart
contract. LIFE users can vote on the nominated charities every three months, with the LIFE allocation dispersed
accordingly.

Through an online voting form, holders of LIFE will be able to propose and then vote on registered charities
to receive a donation of LIFE. This will be a community-guided approach; the only stipulation being that the
charities must be apolitical and humanitarian in nature. Please see page 14 for charities that will be supported.

We will support community projects improving global well-being, education and welfare. There are many stand-
alone projects across the world, some set up as charities, others as not-for-profit social enterprises. We will

identify and support several of these each year and upload blogs by both our staff and guest bloggers, showing
the positive impact that LIFE and its community is having on our global community.

Future LIFE

LIFE is all about the future and sustainability, both economically and for the benefit of mankind.
We will, where we see sustainable projects that fit with our ethos, look to invest in research into

mega-projects of the future, such as space elevators, the Alcubierre drive and other such projects that will have
a major and lasting impact on people's lives.

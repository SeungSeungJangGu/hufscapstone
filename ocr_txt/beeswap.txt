Introduction

In financial industry, the core participant of blockchain
financial is a DAO. In the natural world, We all believe that
the bees is the best decentralized autonomous organization

In the bees’ DAO system, each small bee contributes to the
community through labor. It not only meets the needs of self
and the interests of the community, but also creates more
surplus value that is higher than the needs of its species:
honey.

The achievements of bees, which fully reflect the power of
unorganized collaboration to create an orderly society and
generate value. This kind of strength and order is precisely
the goal of decentralization financial and integration that the
blockchain p

Bees make honey, not for their own food.BeeSwap hopes to
convey the organizational value of honeybees: users, like
bees, can get due rewards by contributing to the community.
And through incredible high-efficiency collaboration, we can

1. Market Analysis

One of the core functions of finance is to solve the incentive
problem. With the appearance and development of DeFi,
which provides new ideas and more possibilities for this
function. In 2020, the DeFi market is ushering in explosive
growth. The locked-in value of DeFi has been soaring as an
indicator to guide market liquidity .On September 18, the
locked-in value of DeFi reached a new high of 10.812 billion
US dollars.The outbreak of DeFi fully shows that the open
and transparent decentralized financial , which based on the
blockchain has huge development potential and will play a
significant role in the future.

In the hot DeFi market, however, behind the sharp increase in
the price of various DeFi project governance tokens, its
market share in the entire blockchain is only 1%, which is
even like a drop in the ocean compared to the entire financial
market. A large number of blockchain users have not yet
participated in the DeFi market. There are several important
reasons for this:
© Congestion and high gas fees of ETH caused a worse
user experience

At present, most liquid mining projects are based on ETH. As the largest
smart contract platform up to now, it has the ability to build smart
contracts compared to Bitcoin. The total market value of DeFi tokens has
reached 15 billion US dollars, exceeding the market value of all public
blockchains except Ethereum. However, due to the current performance
of ETH, the throughput is too low, the speed is slow, the congestion is
serious, and the service fee is expensive, making transactions cost much.
After the DeFi boom subsides, many participants will not be able to afford
the high loss of handing fees.

« DeFi is mainly developed in ETH, so other public

blockchain users cannot have a hand in it
DeFi prime data shows that 80% of DeFi projects are currently on
Ethereum, while EOS and BTC have only 8% of DeFi projects
respectively. Most of the DeFi projects are developed based on ETH, so
that other mainstream public blockchain and mainstream currency
holders cannot be participators in DeFi

Unlimited mining models keep more users daunting
According to a new survey conducted by cryptocurrency market data
provider Crypto Compare, DeFi projects in 2020 are considered
speculative by 90% of the audience, and only 10% of them consider it to
be an acceptable daily financial governance option. The reason is that
many DeFi projects currently adopt an unlimited mining model in order to
increase the enthusiasm of early users. The unlimited currency production
model will make users hold the currency for longer, the scarcity of their
tokens will decrease, and the value of tokens will become lower and
lower. In the end, it will be difficult to truly build consensus and maintain
long-term development.

« The current DeFi project provides high liquidity, but not
have the continuous high value
Currently, DeFi has gained the attention of the blockchain industry
because of its high liquidity. Due to the simple and rude mechanism of
projects in the current DeFi market, a lot of projects do not meet the
conditions still have flooded in, causing bad money drives out good.
Community consensus is difficult to consolidate, and the entire market
cannot maintain a sustainable high value.

If these problems mentioned above cannot be obviously
improved, the DeFi market will soon encounter a
development bottleneck. And DeFi is considered to be the
engine that promotes the development of the blockchain
market. Only when DeFi completely releases its potential can
the entire industry achieve better growth in the long run. To
this end, we launched BeeSwap and proposed our solutions
for the above pain points.

2. BeeSwap

2.1 Brief introduction

BeeSwap is an AMM decentralized trading platform for the
entire blockchain industry, based on the NFT-DAO underlying
governance structure developed by ERC20.BeeSwap is
committed to breaking the barriers of public blockchain,
opening more cross-public blockchain liquidity transactions,
and providing liquidity services to more users. At the same
time, BeeSwap uses the CFMM system to realize automated
transactions and reward liquidity providers. Anyone can
experience the DEX platform service with few service
charge, low slippage and high efficiency. In community
governance, we also introduce NFT attributes to help
BeeSwap capture higher ecological value and build a high-
cohesion community consensus.

2.2 Product highlights

2.2.1 Blockchain—connected aggregator

As Polkadot, Comos, Solana and other public blockchain
ecological projects started liquidity mining, the trend of
blockchain-connected liquidity mining is gradually
revealed.BeeSwap will support ETH, BNB smart chain,
GXChain, TRON chain, and will also support Polkadot and
more public blockchain in the future.
In the initial stage, the integration of wBTC and RenVM
tokenization and blockchain-connected technology will be
introduced in the blockchain-connected aggregation mining,
and then we will develop our own tokenized blockchain-
connected technology and finally realize the decentralized
asset blockchain-connected.

2.2.2 Liq

ity mining with wider coverage
 Blockchain-connected asset staking supporting

In blockchain-connected aggregate mining, it will support multi-chain
mainstream currency staking such as ETH, USDT, HT, GXC,
GOF,BNB,YFIUNI, etc. and produce platform currency BEE.

® Incentivize different DEX liquidity providers LP

‘At the same time, it provides rewards for DEX liquidity provider LP
represented by UniSwap, and supports its platform currency and popular
projects to launch BeeSwap.

2.2.3 Reduction of loss of liqui

© CFMM system

At present, the AMM system represented by UniSwap still has some small
defects, making it difficult to be widely adopted. An AMM system can
choose an unlimited number of specific curves for pricing, and the
current platform uses a single curve. We can abstract all these different
pricing functions and call the entire category constant function market
makers (CFMM). BeeSwap will support multiple AMM curves in light of
the characteristics of different tokens, such as the stable curve used in
stable coins.

Use Layer2 protocol to reduce handling fees
The ETH Layer2 protocol will be connected to enable users to trade at
BeeSwap faster and with lower fees.

2.2.4 NFT-DAO: NFT capture high value and DeFi
improve liquidity

BeeSwap adopts a dual-currency operation governance
structure, which is composed of the DAO governance token
BEE and the BeeSwap ecological token HON. The two
complement each other. BEE can produce HON, or consume
HON to have more HON.We have introduced the attributes of
NFT for the governance token BEE, users can synthesize
NFT-BEE through BEE, and users can also get NFT-QUEEN
by lot drawings. NFT-QUEEN has the right to make
proposals, and all proposals will be reflected on the
blockchain in order to truly realize fairness and transparency
in community governance.The auction value of NFT-QUEEN
and NFT-BEE will also further enhance the community
consensus, enable BEE to capture higher value, and ensure
the lasting stability of the project.

 BeeWorld: The cradle of NFT-QUEEN and NFT-BEE

In BeeWorld, each bee with different attributes corresponds to an NFT on
the chain, with a unique id and status. More importantly, it has its own
independent value. There are only 99 NFT-QUEENs in the entire
BeeWorld, which means 99 nodes. Owning the queen bee (NFT-QUEEN)
has the right to propose, and BEE holders have the right to vote, thereby
helping the community complete governance.

The proposal needs to staking the NFT-QUEEN and a certain percentage
of BEE coins, but this income of the NFT-
QUEEN. The auction cannot be carried out during the staking voting
period. When the voting ends, the NFT-QUEEN and the BEE coins used
for voting returns in the original way, but the BEE used in the passed
proposal will be burned permanently.

does not affect the normal
Users who own NFT-QUEEN will be the lucky ones who benefit the most
from the entire BEE ecosystem. After the staking of HON is launched,
users who own the NFT-BEE can mine by staked BEE coins and NFT-
QUEEN, and the NFT-QUEEN will
than 150% on the basis of ordinary users.

jorease the mining weight by more

Users can also synthesize NFT-BEE with new attributes by consuming
BEE coins, and the BEE coins used for synthesis will be burned
permanently. The level of NFT-BEE is randomly determined according to
the amount of BEE consumed by the user, because the quality of the
synthesized bees is different, and the staking weight and benefits are
also different,

« BeeStore: The NFT auction mall

BeeStore is a bee coin auction site where users can auction their own
NFT-BEE and NFT-QUEEN. Other users can freely participate in the
auction. Successful auctions need a certain of transaction fee, of which
1% will be used for HON holders’ dividends, 1% for HON’s secondary
market repurchase and destruction, and 1% for BeeStore maintenance. In
addition, BeeStore will be open to NFT ecological projects on BeeSwap,
and the NFT of such projects can be auctioned on BeeStore.

Community governance: voting for high quality projects

In BeeSwap, everyone can create trading pairs on it. However, in order to
avoid the chaotic of DeFi mining. BeeSwap will use community voting to
help users screen high-quality projects to reduce the risk of participating
users. Every BEE coin holder has the right to vote. Besides, other
important decisions of the community can be made by voting
3.Token Model

3.1 The output and distribution of BEE

The total amount of BEE is constant at 21 million pieces, and
10% is used for community incentives and ecological
construction (It will be used for cooperative exchange
platform coin mining, ecological partner token mining, and
Bee ecological token mining, investment resource exchange,
etc.), 90% is produced by mining.

3.2 BEE staking

3.2.1 Arrangement of reduction
Each round of mining cycle is one week, 300,000 pieces are
mined in the first week, the output is reduced by 2 times in

subsequent per week.

3.3 The output and distribution of NFT
99 pieces of NFT-QUEEN will be born through staking,
liquidity mining and synthesis. The specific rules will be
announced on the official website, and the lot drawing will be
triggered when the conditions are met. Users who meet the
corresponding requirements can participate in that.

Users can also synthesize NFT-BEE with new attributes
through BEE, and have an opportunity to obtain NFT-
QUEEN. The BEE used for synthesis will be permanently
burned, and the NFT-BEE level is randomly determined
according to the amount of BEE consumed by the user.
Because the quality of the synthesized bees is various, the
stake weight and earnings are also different.

3.4 The output and distribution of HON

The total amount of HON is constant at 1 billion pieces, 10%
is used for community incentive ecological construction, and
90% is produced by community mining. HON staking will
start during the BEE mining process. Users can stake BEE to
get HON. The output will be 1.5 million in the first week, then
it will be reduced by 3 times in the second week, and by 2

times in subsequent per week.

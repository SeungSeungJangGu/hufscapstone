1. Abstract

As the internet has deeply rooted in our daily life and services that only exist in the digital
world have emerged, the concept of purchase and ownership has markedly shifted from
the previous era. In addition to physical goods and services, the concept of digital content
was created. People pay to obtain game items and to stream movies and music, but what
they get is not a physical object. Digital content only exists and is available in the digital world.

Content is not the only category influenced by digitalization. Digitalization of banking such
as payment and remittance makes rare for people to touch or carry cash unless the special
occasions. Furthermore, internet-only bank that handles all its business transaction online
displays rapid growth every day. Current phenomenon has leading us to the world where
paper money exists only as a number in a digital device. Products, services, and currencies
that are not tangible but can be owned in the digital world are considered as digital assets.
As digitalization of the society accelerates, importance of these digital assets becomes more
significant.

Traditional commodity trade is accomplished simply by exchanging the in-kind trade. In case
of digital commodity trade, on the other hand, goes through more complicated process. When
one digitally transfers or sells a product, numerous numbers that represent ownership are
modified during the transaction. Since individually owned digital products are numbers
recorded in the hard disk of the server, commodity trade takes place by changing in numbers
instead of exchanging actual goods. Given the characteristic of such digital assets transactions,
it is impossible to confirm the transaction or ownership without the guarantees of intermediary.
Thus, existence of the third party is essential in the digital transaction, because it ensures
value of asset and guarantees the process. In other words, all current digital transactions are
made under the third party warranties. The third party proving such services relays the transaction
of both parties and generates revenue through advertisement or commission. These third
parties are called as a platform.

Introduction of digital platforms has enabled various services that was not available before.
It removed the barriers of space and time, and let people to readily accessible what they desire.
Along with the development of internet, these platforms have sprung up in diverse areas. They
have become increasingly gigantic and grown large enough to completely monopolize a
certain industry. These giant platforms exert a transcendental influence along with the
centralized power gained from their operation. Paradoxically, the platform, which overcame
barriers between states and stimulated free trade, has become a new centralized powerhouse
that controls participants with its strong influence. The problem of centralization is not
limited to the digital platform alone. Cases of 2016 trade ban by China against Korea and
the trade war between US and China in the mid-2018 demonstrate how vulnerable the real
economy is to the changes in the external environment.
Davinci Foundation established a decentralized platform based on the blockchain technology
and started Davinci Project to promote and to revitalize fair and free economic ecosystem.
Davinci Coin is the major currency and deed in this ecosystem. Through blockchain technology,
it enables secure transaction of digital assets, and stable preservation of ownership and value
without the interference of third parties.

2. Background and Introduction of Davinci Foundation
2.1 Background

Emergence of Centralized Platform

We laugh at videos created in the UK via YouTube, and watch American drama in real time on
Netflix. Also, we play games created by Polish developers through Play Store and listen to pop
songs newly released in US on iTunes. Thanks to the global content platform, which has been
rapidly expanded and popularized in 2010s, people can enjoy any content around the world in
real time. The emergence of a global content platform not only enhanced consumer’s accessibility,
but also transformed the supply behavior of providers. In the past, content providers had to
establish a branch or collaborate with local companies for global services, but global platforms
enabled the world-wide distribution with a few clicks. The era of doing global business without
going abroad has come.

Because of these advantages, the global content platform displayed rapid growth and, at the
same time, global content market expanded enormously. However, this record-breaking growth
of the platforms has eased their monopoly. The large platform has begun to pressure content
providers with power gained from their monopoly of content distribution and advertising
channels. Platforms have collected up to 30-50 percent of content providers’ sales revenues,
and have limited freedom of content development by arbitrarily supporting or censoring specific
contents. The uniform censorship, which does not consider background or cultural situation
of each country, also has reduced the diversity of contents. Consequently, providers are asked
to create platform-friendly contents for smooth distribution of their works. As participants grow,
providers have to spend larger amounts of money on platform-owned advertisement in addition
to the platform-imposed fees.

The problem with large platforms is not limited to suppliers. For instance, operators of large
portal sites curate the news posted on the site main. This authority allows them to have
powerful influences on the public opinion as well as the media that supply articles. Moreover,
the platform has a direct impact on individual property rights due to its deep engagement
with the ownership and transaction process of personal digital assets. Abruptly suspending
a game that is in service because of platform policy violation or prohibiting the sales or resale
of specific items are representative examples. By enforcing various guidelines towards its
participants, the platform is able to directly alter the value of digital assets by utilizing collected
information of participants.
Change in Financial System

Recently, the transition to a cashless society is rapidly proceeding based on the popularization
of simple payment systems such as Alipay and Kakao Pay. Dissemination of the simple payment
system is especially more prominent in countries where the usage of cash is higher than credit
cards such as in China and Japan than in Korea. The simple payment contributes to make
cashless society and is spreading rapidly among consumers for its convenience. Specifically,
Zero-dollar tour, buying goods or using services via simple payment system without exchanging
money, has significantly grown. Internet-only banks like Kakao Bank and K Bank that established
in 2017 have become convenient medium of payment for digital contents and money transfers
on mobile devices. Consequently, the usage of internet-only bank in the economy is still increasing
with its convenience as advantage.

The issue is that an introduction of such a simple payment system or digital bank does not
cause fundamental changes in the financial market. The financial system hegemony is gradually
shifting from a conventional bank or credit card company to a simple payment system operator
or an internet-only bank. However, business owners and consumers experience little to no
differences. High commission burden on the owners still remains. In case of individuals, all
transaction and financial records are stored in a central server of the service provider in the
form of big data, which makes it rather vulnerable to the possible personal information leakage.
Additionally, as banks and service providers conduct analysis of personal information, the
side effects of privacy violations also have been rising.

On-Offline Convergence through 020 Service

In the past, except for online shopping and reservation, application of internet service in the
real life has been limited. However, the recent growth of 020 services like Uber or Mobike has
diminished the barriers between online and offline, and led a new trend of shared economy.
The online services become more and more influential in real life. As the network transaction
speeds up and the computing power for Al and big data operation grows, this phenomenon
to combine online and offline world have accelerated. Simultaneously, the need for an integrated
platform has been amplified.

Prohibition of Korean Culture in China, and Tariff War

According to trade statistic in 2017, the proportion of the trade with China accounted over 20
percent (24.8 percent for export, 20.5 percent for import) of total Korea trade, which ranked as
the first in both exports and imports. China imported 9.9 percent of its total trade from South
Korea, which ranked as the first surpassing Japan. Korea is also placed as a 4th in China’s export
by covering 4.3 percent of total. The large scale of the China-Korea exchange, covering significant
amount of their trade, has noticeably decreased due to the influence of restrictions on Korean
Culture in China. This led to 15 trillion-won loss only in 2017. Unexpected diplomatic issue has
adversely affected the economic and the cultural exchanges between countries.
Another instance is the trade war between the United States and China in 2018. The trade war
has damaged American and Chinese companies. Moreover, the damage is spreading even to
ordinary consumers because of the price escalation, which is caused by the increase in the
cost of raw materials. Korea is also not free from the influence of this trade war, so decrease
of intermediary goods export about 30.4 trillion-won is expected due to the contraction of
Chinese economy. Other than the mentioned cases, there are several examples of diplomatic
and political issues impacting inter-country exchanges such as Brexit and oil price fluctuation
due to the sanction against Iran.

Politics and diplomacy are not always affecting the economy in a negative way. Chinese
government’s one-on-one policy has stimulated global expansion of Chinese companies.
The recent North and South Korean governments’ reconciliation mood has raised expectations
for new business opportunities including the resumption of Kaesong Industrial Complex, the
connection of continent railways, and the development of underground resources. In the past,
political situations between countries had limited influence to the economy since the trade
and exchanges took restrictively. However, the political and diplomatic issues between
countries are considered as a significant variable in the era of doing business beyond national
boundaries.

2.2 Decentralization by Blockchain

The Bitcoin economy ensures the security of the system by encrypting and recording all
transactions through distributed database consists of a large number of nodes in the entire
P2P network. The decentralized nature of P2P and the high security obtained by encryption
algorithms make it impossible to artificially manipulate the transaction history. Thereby the
Bitcoin economy is able to secure its transaction without third party guarantee. These
characteristics of Bitcoin have actualized a philosophical value of decentralization.

In 2015, the blockchain technology took a step further with the development of Ethereum, by
Vitalik Buterin, which combined smart contract with the decentralized blockchain system of Bitcoin.
Ethereum is a blockchain platform that has enabled smart contracts on blockchain. The smart
contract is created with Solidity language and then goes through the compiling process. Byte
codes generated after the compiling process are implemented in the Ethereum Virtual Machine
(EVM). The emergence of Ethereum has spared technological competition of the blockchain
industry, and many engineers and experts have taken a next stop to lead the hegemony of the
4th Industrial Revolution.

However, the fact that blockchain is considered as core technology of the 4th Industrial
Revolution is not merely due to its superior functionality compared to existing technology.
In case of Bitcoin, the number of transaction per second is only 5-7, which is far below the
level of commercialization. Ethereum also, is not efficient enough compared to the current
centralized transaction system because of its excessive commissions. Nevertheless, the
blockchain technology is still spotlighted since it delivers the value of decentralization to the
public.
The society faces new challenges including <Market Monopoly of Centralized Platform>,
<Change in Financial System>, <On-Offline Convergence>, which are caused by the rapid
development of digital world since the Internet Revolution of the 2000s. Moreover, complex
international relationships make the business environment even more unpredictable. Since
the current centralized structure is unable to tackle these problems, the decentralization is
considered as the only answer.

2.3 Davinci Foundation

Davinci Foundation is established with Korean and Chinese economic, cultural, and ICT experts
to provide a civic-level solution to the economic crisis that occurred due to the trade restriction
placed between Korea and China in 2016. The foundation has proposed a decentralized
economic ecosystem constructed with blockchain technology. it has been implemented in
response to the rapid social transformation towards digital age and the necessity to build a
new type of economic system free from the barriers between states. Davinci Project, which
is universal platform based on blockchain, has been launched with the strong brand power
of Korean Wave and the possible synergy generated through Chinese market and advancing
technology as the driving force of constructing ecosystem.

3. Davinci Project
3.1 Trust Structure based on Al

As previously described, blockchain technology is designed to solve the shortcomings of the
existing centralized system. However, it has been utilized only in confined ways due to the
technical limitations of numerous cryptocurrencies to date. The proof of work(POW) is a
competition based verification method that wastes significant amount of unnecessary
computational power and has slow transaction speed. The emergence of Bitmain, a gargantuan
site specializes in mining, particularly has threatened the value of decentralization because
it is impossible to exclude the possibility of monopoly through acquiring over 51 percent of
total hash power.

In order to improve the low efficiency of the POW system, POS system has been introduced. Yet,
the merit of decentralization has been reduced because only a selected number of people has
granted the mining authority to increase its transaction speed. The fundamental principle of
decentralization is obtained by mutual check by a large number of people. Therefore, the
emergence of giant mining sites or the way of vesting a few people with authority is an ultimate
threat to the fundamental principle. In 2018, the hash power war between Jihan Wu and Craig
Steven Wright broke out due to the hard-fork problems of the Bitcoin cache. As seen in the hash
power war, many of the damage caused by massive power is unavoidable regardless of the
intentions of involved minorities. After all, as long as the main body of the system is run by human,
the monopoly of the system through the expansion and loss of the participants are inevitable.
Consequently, the value of decentralization is difficult to be materialized.
To create trustworthy environment where all nodes in the entire system freely and securely
exchange the data, Davinci Project authorizes Al to manage whole system, which is specifically
designed based on the agreed norms. This is called DAI. DAI constantly analysis and learns
the transaction. In this manner, DAI continuously seeks the most optimized solution for
maintaining fair development of ecosystem rather than focusing on interest of particular parties.
In other words, it represents the shift the subject of trust from “human” to “technology.”

For the purpose of creating a decentralized global economic ecosystem, Davinci Project is
building a business platform that covers diverse sectors including entertainment, games,
education, tourism, medical service and on-and offline. Furthermore, it has contributed to
the dissemination of blockchain infrastructure through collaboration with states, local
governments, and public corporations. In the global ecosystem built by Davinci Foundation,
Davinci Coin is the fundamental base and the key asset. Within the ecosystem, the coin allows
one to directly participate as a member or to enjoy all benefits gained from business activities.

Davinci Alliance

Incubating Development

AP! Connection

Alliance of Davinci
Conventional blockchain based platforms have limited capabilities to establish and activate
ecosystem, since companies willing to participate the platform were only able to join through
the development or mining of DApp. In addition to the above reason, the existing platform
holders are the proven experts of blockchain, but they have limited understanding on the
other industries. Thus, it has been difficult for them to proceed each business directly with
low-level of knowledge. The platform holders, also, have filed to provide incentives for attracting
DApp developers or customers to the ecosystem. Therefore, talented developers have preferred
to jump directly into the platform competition through ICO, rather than to be a part of the
conventional platforms. As a result, only platforms with similar feature and performance have
remained in the market without a clear vision or efficiency.

All companies, institutions, and investors participating in Davinci Project’s ecosystem are
called as Davinci Alliance, and their vigorous activities stimulate this ecosystem. The top
priorities of the project are to enlighten diverse ways to participate the ecosystem, to satisfy
the needs of participants, and to offer solutions to many challenges that arise in business
activities. In other words, Davinci Project aims at creating a structure that allows companies
to willingly involve in ecosystem for a better business environment.

Davinci Foundation provides diverse supports to Davinci Alliance such as MainNet and numerous
technologies through API. Moreover, the foundation offers incubating services in each step
of Value-chain process such as funding, ICO, contents production, and service for the greater
business growth opportunities through a better business environment.

By owning Davinci Coin, coin holders are able to support various activities of Davinci Foundation.
In addition, Davinci Coin holders are able to utilize diverse services available in the ecosystem.
The coin is issued in limited quantities of 8.8 billion, and value of the coin escalates as value
of the business in the ecosystem increases. In other words, financial benefit of obtaining coin
proliferates as the ecosystem thrives. Therefore, a first comer who participates at the initial
stage and contributes more to the concretization of the ecosystem receives larger compensation.
Within the ecosystem, Davinci Coin serves as a key currency and becomes a digital asset as a
proof of the ownership that ensures service usage.

3.3 Online Business

Heat of the Korean Wave, which started from K-Drama <Dae Jang Gum>, has spread up to U.S.
market, the capital of various cultural contents, with Korean boy band BTS. Based on the
prominent potential and worldwide influence of the Korean Wave, Davinci Platform supports
production of diverse online contents including game, video, education, and music. The platform
also supports distribution and services of these contents for the global market penetration. In
particular, Aster Engine (Al engine) combined with the platform allows consumers to have easy
access to contents that suit their taste. This also provides highly efficient target marketing services
to content providers with low cost.

Davinci Content Distribution Platform

Davinci Content Platform is a global contents distribution platform that combines blockchain
and Al technology to contents distribution and services. Blockchain technology minimizes
intervention of the platform holder. Thus, content providers and consumers are able to be
directly connected through the platform, which lowers the supply cost and enables direct
communication. In this way, providers’ freedom of creation is assured, and consumers are
able to enjoy diverse high-quality contents. Davinci Content Platform also filters inappropriate
contents through Al and optimizes the connection between consumers and suppliers. This
enables companies to perform accurate target marketing and to reduce the costs.

3.4 Offline Business

By extending its business scope to 020 and offline service, Davinci Project plans to break
boundaries between online and offline assets. This expansion also expects to appreciate value
of Davinci Coin, a digital asset. As of 2018, Davinci Project has signed MOUs with more than 30
partners, which accounts more than 100 franchises. The project cooperates with the partners
to construct wholesome Davinci Payment System.

Davinci 020 Service and Payment

Davinci’s decentralized offline platform adopts all benefits of the simple payment system and
solves privacy issues occurred under the centralized system. Along with the payment system,
the platform especially offers O20 service similar to T-Bot that recommends the best tourist
destination through Al.

3.5 Development of Blockchain Infrastructure

Davinci Project has been collaborated with states and local governments, and constructed
blockchain infrastructure. The project has expanded the base of the blockchain, increased
the influence of Davinci Coin, and promoted the standardization of blockchain technology.
By utilizing blockchain technology, Davinci has participated in various currency and
e-Government projects including African digital currency projects and welfare point of local
governments.

Blockchain e-Government Business

e-Government under the conventional central server system requires enormous maintenance
and management fees. On the other hand, e-Government using the blockchain system is
easy to construct and reduces maintenance fee. Therefore, the quality of administrative
services expects to improve by spreading blockchain based e-Government in countries where
they have relatively insufficient system. In addition, Davinci Project’s base expands during
this process.

In Africa, more than 50 percent of the population is not registered, so these people are left out
from the administrative supports such as education and welfare. Instead, the penetration rate
of mobile phones is approaching 70 percent. The development of DApp, which allows people
to access administrative services built with blockchain technology via mobile phone, is going
to enable administrative tasks such as registration of birth, marriage, automobile, and real-
estate. It incorporates citizens who have been left behind at the blind area of administration,
raises the policy efficiency, and establishes the base foundation for further development.

Blockchain Banking System Business

In African countries where the banking system is less accessible, only 20 percent of the population
obtains their own bank accounts and most of people store their cash at home. This exposes people
to robbery and to other risks. Furthermore, limited access to bank restricts economic activities
such as transfer money. Constructing centralized bank system is costly, and maintaining the
system is even harder because of its vulnerability to hacking and other external factors. On the
other hand, the banking system built with blockchain technology is easily established with more
security and less cost. In cooperation with several countries and banks, Davinci Foundation
plans to increase financial accessibility of people by introducing a new banking system with
blockchain and to promote economic development of the countries. As a consequence, influence
of Davinci Project is going to expand.
Real Estate(Reits), and Securitization of Resources

Through the registration of real-estate or natural resources in blockchain system, offline assets
are transformed into online assets. These online assets are freely distributed and traded in
the online environment in conjunction with Davinci Coin. Transaction transparency of the
asset is especially valuable to economic development of countries such as Africa, where can
be easily exposed to the risk of forgery and alteration of official documents. Moreover, the
system allows one to simply track and control the distribution process of recourses. Therefore,
resources such as diamond, gold, and crops are able to be managed effectively.

4. Davinci MainNet with DAI

4.1 Overview

As it can be seen, cryptocurrency has a structure capable of secure transactions without
intermediaries through distributed ledger. Yet speed and stability of the system require further
improvement for the full commercialization. In order to resolve these problems, Davinci
Foundation aims to overcome speed limitation of existing MainNet(TPS) by utilizing DAPOS
method, which is an advanced version of DPOS method. To this end, DAI, ‘Chain Generation
Al Solution, has been developed to overcome the limitation of existing TPS by merging Al
technology and MainNet. Then the business model solution is created based on the characteristics
of the generated chain.

Davinci Foundation has tried to solve Ethereum’s inherent speed (TPS: transaction per second)
issue by utilizing MainNet with DAPOS method, which is an advanced version of POS method.
Along with the high-level engineers, the foundation has developed MainNet, operated with
DAPOS method, and Davinci Coin(DAC) to cope with above problem. Specifically, the
development of DAI, ‘Chain Generation Al Solution, has dealt with the chronic TPS reduction
problem since it overcomes conventional TPS limitation by grafting Al on MainNet. Furthermore,
the business solution extracted from the unique features of generated chains are introduced
as well.

DAC is cryptocurrency used in several automatically generated Sidechains within Davinci
MainNet. When MainNet belongs to the root layer and the specific nodes are appointed,
transaction occurs via Sidechains created between these sectors. Here, DAC functions as a
coin that is able to be transferred between nodes of each chain.

4.2 Davinci Al Solution, DAI

This white paper describes the principle of Davinci’s ‘Chain Generation Al Solution,’
DAI, and how DAI is applied to construct business models. DAI learns information of all
nodes in MainNet and automatically generates new Sidechain based on the educated
characteristics of these nodes. During this performance, it improves the efficiency of the
chain operation.

- 12 -
Ethereum currently uses POW method and is ready for transition to POS method of Casper
algorithm in early 2019. Ethereum operates at the speed of less than 20TPS, but it even slows
down because of the traffic that occurs in the chain as a result of the increase in total number
of users. To overcome similar problem, Davinci Foundation has dispersed the network traffic
by building independent Sidechain. Consequently, the TPS has displayed enormous increase,
about 50 times faster than the average 20TPS, and maintained relatively stable operation with
network equipped with Al.

The principles of DAI are as follows:

A. Transaction data between the nodes, which are generated every minute as the MainNet
is operated, is subdivided and stored based on each node.

B. Stored data are analyzed and classified - categorized as data to be stored in the MainNet
which is the base layer, and as data to be stored in the Sidechain to be generated later.

C. Large number of nodes are quickly analyzed to extract characteristics of each nodes and
subdivide the result into large, medium, and small groups to define the type of each node.

D. New Sidechains are automatically generated based on the type of formed node.

4.3 Apply Al to DPOS MainNet, DAPOS

DPOS is a method of selecting block generator by voting of each node. DAI involves in the
voting process and extracts the characteristic of each node, and the block generator with
unique attributes is selected based on the extracted result. With automatically selected nodes,
DAI generates Sidechain. To put it shortly, DAPOS is the method that highly escalates impartiality
and efficiency by applying Al on existing DPOS system base.

Additionally, when DAI generates Sidechain, as ensuring security of financial factors like tokens
is vital, it processes data separately, hence security required data can be managed by the MainNet,
which is the base layer. Other data or elements that are directly connected to services are
proceeded to be included in newly created Sidechains.

The operational efficiency of DAPOS MainNet after DAI is applied is a time reduction effect. Also,
by creating Sidechain with particular tendencies allows generation of Sidechain according to the
intention of the MainNet system operators, or DApp operators who uses DAPOS MainNet.
Therefore, it has a great impact in terms of efficiency of Sidechain generation. (The efficiency at
this time is the efficiency of the operation, not the speed)

- 13 -
Node Analysis

DAI’s node analysis is based on following criteria. The volume of MainNet the node belongs
and its increasing speed in the number of nodes, the data of average time it takes to select
a block generator or a witness through DAPOS method, the data of average time it takes for
a block validation node to perform check and to broadcast the result to the entire network,
selection of a specific node according to the degree of power and the range of fluctuation
within the chain of each node, the unfair trade transaction inspection, and the log activity
data of double payment attempts within the chain are collected to be analyzed.

Generation of New Sidechain

DAI analyses countless nodes as described above and models them in real-time. Through
real-time monitoring, when the transaction-per-second (TPS) of the MainNet drops below
15TPS, DAI automatically begins to create a new Sidechain with nodes previously modeled
by types. Additionally, as it operates newly created Sidechains and the existing MainNet, the
number of transaction occurrence, contract conclusion speed (= TPS), the contract transmission
speed between the MainNet and Sidechains, and its stability are monitored in real-time.

Creating Business Model

Grouping nodes by type through DAI, a profit model suitable for the characteristics of the node
group can be predicted and established when Sidechain is formed and operated. Prediction
of business models is provided as visualized data through the platform that Davinci developed
and will be available after the platform deployment. Additionally, apart from the generation
of Sidechain, it is possible for DAI to create Sidechain with customization of the DApp operator,
thereby producing a business model that incorporates operator condition. In conclusion,
development of DAI, automatic Sidechain generation solution based on MainNet, makes
blockchain and service operation more efficient and productive than before.

4.4 DAI Implementation

A. Store every transaction on MainNet

Obtaining data of a node is achieved by log file reporting system that implemented during
the development of DApp. A batch program should be developed to create a log file in csv
format to be automatically stored in MongoDB.

It finds individual node connection based on the contract address of the nodes scattered

based on the characteristics of each node.

Transection volume value and token retention are different per nodes. DAI determines the rank of each
node by these two factors and displays it in alphabet forms. Additional evaluation factors other than the
above two factors specify the disposition of each node.

Logistic Regression is repeatedly performed using selected nodes. Through this exercises,
P1, P2...Pn-1 value nodes are selected and classified as a nodes capable of generating a new
Sidechain. During the process, it is important to create a large number of hidden layers and
utilize them for the filtering in order to analyze numerous nodes with a wide variety of
characteristics. Creating too many hidden layers is not encouraged since the speed of machine-
learning logic execution can be degraded and overfitting can occur depending on the conditions,
which lowers the accuracy.

Node groups are classified with various criteria for generating Sidechain, and each node
group’s characteristic can be subdivided into a major and minor features based on information
of individual node learnt with CNN methods. Major characteristic is extracted and goes
through same operation 4 to 5 times until it converges into one unique characteristic. The
converged characteristic of node becomes a predictable business model.

1. Data extracted from transaction log and stored in MongoDB

Key is the stored transaction data: It is a JSON method taking value format. DAI extracts a
value of each transaction data (from, to, gas, gasPrice, input data, nonce, transaction-index,
etc.) and matches the user information of the corresponding node stored in DApp. In other
words, first, it extracts data that can be matched with the information collected through DApp
from many key values. Then it performs the operation of decoding and matching separately.
Below left is the transaction data image. Image on the right is about the data analysis. Data
used for the analysis are collected and matched via DApp among encrypted data. Transaction
ID, transaction occurrence time (=sign.up date), contract address (from, to), value transferred
through contract, type of token, name, and amount of token possessions are the data items
that can be specified.

matched-data analysis. The extracted data components are transaction ID, transaction occurrence time (=sign up date),
contract address (from, to), contract value, type of token, name, and amount of token.

DAI digitalizes the characteristics of analyzed nodes and computes the rank of each node. DAI
also comprehensively accounts MainNet size, transaction creation time, validity verification
time, its recognition level in the MainNet, amount of retained tokens and transaction volume
to entitle each node’s rank and type.

Fig 14. . Calculate node rating and node characterization criteria | Fig 15. Grouping of node (group_a, b, c....)

After grouping the nodes by each rank, DAI automatically generates the Sidechain composed
of each group. During the Sidechain creation, DAl automatically proceeds the process with
contract address (from, to address) at initial chain creation stage to acquire the contract that
are necessary for the completion.

This feature of DAI reduces the weight of network when a new Sidechain is created with extracted
node group and increases overall network transaction speed. While the transaction is in process,
‘Transaction Endorsement Time’ occurs at the same time. In the process, as the smaller the
number of nodes to reach the 'Endorsement' phase, it takes less time. This principle applies
to the case of DAI.

Fig 16. Transaction level comparison diagram of Sidechain and existing MainNet. Assuming that all transaction requires
same transaction endorsement time, it can be logically deduced that there are procedure differences as shown
in the image.

Such a new chain, which is resulted from one characteristic automatically generated by DAI,
allows for the creation and development of new predictable business models as node
characteristics are taken into consideration, which can be converted into visualization data
as shown below

Fig 18. Convergence of node groups. It is a business predictable model graph of a Sidechain that converges into 6 types
(Node groups with A, B, C, D, E, and F characteristics). The y-axis represents success prediction scale and measure
of the possibility of business model success when repeated logistic regression is applied to each Sidechain.

DAI is able to realize the business model according to the intention of the operator by recognizing
and classifying the characteristics of the node through machine learning and creating a new
Sidechain.

The graph below shows what results can be obtained by increasing the number of selected
nodes with the purpose of time. MIDI (Marketing Intention to Drive Income) node number
value converges overtime into a single value, which is a group of nodes with one characteristic.

While considering for ways to improve the speed of POW/POS, learning and creating a new
MainNet through Al were adapted. Davinci Foundation has set its aim of achieving the
improvement through DAPOS method and carried out this development. Several experiments
have demonstrated that new business models can be developed by generating specialized
Sidechains, rather than simply aiming at improving speed of automatic generation of Sidechain
through artificial intelligence.

By making this even more advanced, Davinci Foundation is going to produce an automatic
Sidechain generation machine that has degree of completion, which will contribute to the

stability and to development of the blockchain ecosystem.

Simplified view of programmatic ads market

The current programmatic advertising landscape is highly opaque and fragmented. Far
too many intermediaries stand between advertiser and publisher. This causes
inefficiency in pricing while intermediaries fees consume huge parts of publishers’
revenue. For example, Google Adsense takes a 32% cut for allowing you to find suitable
advertisers. Reliable estimates of typical intermediary fees are hard to get (no surprise!),
but estimates point to around 50% fees'. Some high-profile cases point to even more
absurd fees up to 70%". Just to recap: advertisers pay $3.00 per thousand impressions
while the publishers who actually deliver these impressions only get $1.50, or perhaps
even $0.90! This massively inefficient market is ripe for disruption.

More accurate state of advertisement ecosystem"

Part of the problem that causes this fragmented market is that there is no one standard
for communication between advertisers. The Adtech industry is trying to establish such
standards, but the dominant model of Real-Time-Bidding is extremely expensive and
does not scale well.

@g) ADsHaRES 4
The primary aim for the Adshares project is to render various ad exchanges obsolete by
making an open platform that will enable advertisers and publishers to find themselves
and trade directly using blockchain.

Standardized exchange and easy access to market will foster development of open
algorithms that will enable publishers to be their own SSP and advertisers to be their
own DSP.

New peer-to-peer solution

Decentralized market

A real-time auction to determine a buyer for every single ad request is both costly and
ineffective. It forces advertisers to blindly buy impressions because there is insufficient
time to properly assess them. It greatly increases the cost of infrastructure because RTB
systems must operate under strict response time constraints. Adshares network is
based on a different model of market; every advertiser creates an account on blockchain
and associates it with their domain.

An advertiser uses Adshares Api to describe the inventory which he wishes to advertise.
A typical entry will include creative content (banner, text, video), various information
about the intended audience and, of course, price. It is up to the advertiser to decide
which information is made public and which is to remain a secret.

Publishers use blockchain to discover advertisers and crawl their inventories. When a
user visits the publisher's site, the inventory database is analyzed to find the banner with
the highest expected payout. Before displaying the banner to a user, a script checks if
the banner is exactly the same as the one promised in the inventory.

The advertiser collects information about displayed ads and periodically (e.g. every hour)
analyzes received events and decides which one to pay for and how much.

Both sides of the network constantly learn and evaluate the reputation of different
actors. Advertisers have an incentive to pay a fair amount for displaying their ads or risk
getting banned from the most valuable sites, or even lose bids to other advertisers.
Publisher are incentivized to display the most matching ads to maximize their yield.

Disintermediation

There are services in the advertising space that need some kind of trusted authority to
ease trading of impressions. An example of such a need is classification of content.
Some publishers are interested in filtering which kinds of ads they want to display on
their websites. For example, they want to exclude adult content or gambling. This
creates the need for a common standard of ads classification. Adshares can
accommodate such needs by introducing in-network services.

@g) ADsHaRES 5
To further illustrate this, there can be a service which classifies advertisements. Digitally
signed classifications from popular providers can be included alongside inventory.
Publishers can then have a policy of only displaying advertisements checked by
providers whom they trust. This encourages advertisers to undergo quality checking,
there can be numerous competing standards, and everything can be paid using
Adshares Tokens.

More generally, we can observe that ad exchanges operating in centralized
environments have huge pricing power over their users as they can enforce certain
policies and accompanying services, like ad quality standards, landing page classification
or data services. The smallest users are the ones most disadvantaged in this area. With
an efficient, common means of payment, most of the accompanying services can move
to on-demand services, competition will greatly increase and prices will fall.

Reduced fraud

Accounts used to receive and send payments for ads on blockchain will be linked to
domains. This repository of cryptographic keys can be leveraged to authenticate events
generated during ad request and delivery. This will substantially reduce surface attacks
by fraudsters.

Adshares operates on the “display first, collect payment later” principle. This gives
significant advantage to advertisers because they are not forced to blindly bid in RTB
auctions and, therefore, can take more time to assess the validity of impressions. Fraud
can be further eliminated by adopting a revenue sharing model.

Decreased effectiveness of ad blockers

A distributed network gives everyone the ability to serve ads from their own server /
domain with custom solutions. This will make adblock software an order of magnitude
harder to develop.

User ecosystem

When the system reaches widespread adoption, users can start to use Adshares Tokens.
For example, a user can offer their own bids to a website to not display any ads or share
their advertising preferences with publishers to get better ads or just be part of the
advertiser payment.

Business model

Market Size

Programmatic digital display advertising spending is projected to be over 32 billion
dollars in 2017 in the USA alone. It is expected to grow to almost 46 billion dollars by
2019”. This huge market with dynamic y/y growth is an ideal target for disruption.

Global digital ads spending is projected to exceed $220 billion dollars in 2017. The share
of programmatic ads is growing.” Profitability can be reached once Adshares takes over
even a small portion of the ad market and satisfied with only 1% average fee collected
from payments. 1% fee is an order of magnitude smaller than current rates, so even
higher revenues might be possible.

Scenario Revenue per annum based on year 2017

1% of global digital ads market; 1% fee 22 million dollars

10% of US programmatic market; 1% fee 32 million dollars

10% of global digital ads market; 1% fee 220 million dollars

@g) ADsHaRES 7
Competition

Basic Attention Token. Although BAT attempts to bring blockchain to advertising, its
target is to fundamentally change how ads are viewed. This is a laudable goal but it will
have enormous adoption problems. Even the first step, making users switch their
favorite browser for a BAT alternative, is a huge challenge. We think it is better to serve
the existing market and evolve it for future use while simultaneously making money for
token holders. BAT is also a potential user of ESC blockchain as they currently have no
working solution for efficient large scale multi party token transfers.

Big players in the ad exchange market like Google DoubleClick, AppNexus, OpenX, AOL's
Marketplace will not be able to prevent their users from simultaneously using our
product so, they will have to reduce fees and adapt or maybe even start posting their
inventories on our network.

Competitive advantages

The main competitive advantage of the Adshares Network is greatly improved
transparency and reduced barrier to entry. This will cut off most of the profit for
middlemen and greatly reduce the cost of advertising. Reduced costs will make
advertisers and publishers eager to switch to our platform.

A second area of improvement is resistance to fraud and the ability to serve ads to
customers with adblock. A new model, paying for advertisers after impression, gives
advertisers more time to evaluate whether traffic is genuine. Fraud can even be totally
removed by switching to revenue sharing. For example, an advertiser running an online
shop can pay for directed traffic by sharing revenue generated by users.

Reduced prices and disintermediation of various services will fuel greater competition
which will further reduce prices and give incentives to improve existing services.

Present ecosystem Adshares Network
Opaque auction system Transparency
Proprietary software Free software, open source infrastructure

Advertiser pays upfront -uncertainty about | Advertiser pays after impression, less
delivery incentive for fraud

Expensive ads due to middlemen fees Efficient ad pricing

No surprises - every ad content is checked

Publisher not sure what ads are displayed against hash before displaying

Growth plan

Adshares Network is under active development”. Blockchain for Adshares Token and
Adshares Adserver have completed proof of concept stages and are working prototypes.
More work is needed to bring products to release quality. There is also a need for an
improved user interface.

Bringing Adshares token blockchain to release quality will take 3 - 12 months depending
on funding levels.

Finishing development of Adshares Adserver will take another 3 - 12 months.

Simultaneously, we will make further efforts to find business partners in the ad market
and start running gateways to existing ad exchanges. This is needed to overcome the
chicken-and-egg problem of bootstrapping network. By copying inventory from existing
ad networks, we will have a good offer for advertisers and publishers from day one.

The next area that needs attention is the internal market for accompanying services. We
will run basic data and ad quality checking tools within the network. Preferably, we will
establish business relations with existing players in this space as they are not competing
with our product.

After the network starts, we will use machine learning and analytics tools to improve the
efficiency of Adshares Adserver.

Financing
The current ICO market is troubled by various problems ranging from unfair token
distribution rules to outright frauds. We feel that the dominant process of raising funds

@g) ADsHaRES 9

in ICO’s is not optimal from the investors and entrepreneurs point of view. It offers too
little protections for investors and too little incentives for entrepreneurs to deliver
working product. That's why we will fund Adshares development in a better way.

Adshares ICO

The Adshares ICO will be run on the Ethereum platform which uses an innovative
formula that grants token buyers unique protection and at the same time aligns the
incentives of founders with those of token buyers.

ICO’s release funds after a defined time and minimum threshold of financing is reached.
With our ICO, there is no defined deadline on which tokens are distributed. Instead, the
ICO contract issues tokens continuously and keeps all the collected funds inside the
contract, slowly releasing them to the ICO creator. Anyone not happy with speed or
other aspects of project development can at any time resale their tokens to the contract
at a price specified by the formula.

To encourage early participation, the price of Adshares Tokens will gradually rise with
the number of tokens in circulation. Price of token will be linearly proportional to the
number of outstanding tokens.

@g) ADsHaRES 10
Note that the actual contract will operate in ETH, so final prices will determined by ETH
market price by the time the contract is deployed and will be fixed in ETH terms from
then on.

A similar pricing formula will be used to calculate the price at which the ICO contract will
buy back outstanding tokens. Each token will be bought for a price proportional to
tokens in circulation and depending on funds remaining inside the contract.

Adshares ICO will release up to 1% of funds outstanding in contract every week. This is
maximum amount that can be released, but we plan to withdraw only minimal funds
that are needed for development and keep the rest of the ether in contract to facilitate
token buyback.

After development of Adshares own blockchain, all holders of Adshares Tokens will be
entitled to proportionally divide among themselves 50% of coins created in the new
blockchain genesis block.

@g) ADsHaRES 11
As we can see in the chart above, market valuation of the project rises exponentially
while token prices rise linearly. This means that early buyers of ICO Tokens do not lose
when later participants inflate token supply.

Early buyers acquired 10% of supply for $100k giving a $1M valuation. If later supply
expands by 100% their share drops to 5% but token price rises by 100%, effectively
giving $4M market valuation. This means their initial share is now worth $200k, so
tokens can be sold for 100% profit.

Financing goal

Adshares tokens will be phased out once custom blockchain for Adshares is ready. The
ICO contract will then enter the allocation phase. Users will have 1 month to decide
whether they are happy with development results and want to be allocated with custom
blockchain tokens. If not - they can always resell their tokens to the ICO contract. When
the allocation phase ends, all funds collected in the contract will be released to the ICO
creator and the contract will stop accepting new funds and cease buyback of tokens.
Holders of Adshares Tokens will be entitled to a share of 50% of coins created in
Adshares blockchain genesis block. To claim your share, you will have to send tokens
back to a special contract created for that purpose.

The other 50% of blockchain coins will be used to incentivize founders and other key
team members. The financial motive for founders and team members combined with
the long lock-up period will greatly increase chances of making a successful product.

FAQ
e Who can participate in the ICO?
You can participate in ICO if you are not a U.S. citizen, resident or entity (a “U.S.
Person”) nor are you purchasing Adshares Tokens on behalf of a U.S. Person.
e Who organizes ICO?
ICO is organized by AdShares Incorporated, Trust Company Complex, Ajeltake

Publishers will crawl inventory from all known advertisers and use it to optimize
revenue.

Sending payments
Every advertiser periodically analyzes a log of served ads. Such a process may involve
checking impressions against fraud databases or analyzing data from user interactions

@g) ADsHaRES 13
on the landing page. The algorithm can be simple or complicated - it depends on
advertiser needs. The goal of this process is to assign monetary value to every
impression. Once this is done, one bulk payment is generated to all publishers that
displayed advertiser ads during the processing period. The result of this process is
remembered so the advertiser can provide detailed impression stats to the publisher.

Receiving payments

The publisher is connected to blockchain and waits for payments from advertisers. Each
incoming payment is analyzed. First, the publisher downloads details of payments by
contacting the advertiser's domain

GET /adshares/report/<TX ID>/<PUBLISHER ADDRESS>

Downloaded reports help the publisher to adjust its algorithms to better understand
advertiser needs.

Improving ads selection

Publishers constantly compare expected payouts from various impressions with actually
received payments. They use this data to evaluate and improve weighting assigned to
different factors which determine ads selection. This process should in time lead to
better revenue.

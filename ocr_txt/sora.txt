What is Sora?

Sora is a decentralized, world economic
system, also called a Decentralized
Autonomous Economy (DAE).

lt is centered around Sora (XOR) and the
Sora Passport mobile app, which allows
users to participate in the Sora DAE.

Sora is about:
e Democratization
¢ Empowerment

e Collaboration

Problems with existing currencies

Existing cryptocurrencies:

¢ Centralized distribution
e Lack a rational economic model

¢ Discourages collaboration, as each project creates their own unique token

Our mission: democratisation, empowerment & collaboration

We want Sora to act as the people's passport into a new economic system.

Our mission is to empower and connect people through an economic system that emphasizes its users

preferences, needs, and dreams.

¢ Through the spirit of collaboration, our mission is to become the premier decentralized economy in the

world.

e We will become a trend-setting economic system that inspires a global community to exchange,

produce, and thrive economically.

¢ We envision Sora as one of the most recognized currencies of the 21st century that cultivates and

promotes small business growth, cultural enrichment, and democratized exchange of value

Why Sora is good for humanity?

We can empower people by giving them the ability to
raise the Funds they need to create new services that are

productive to society.

This will advance humanity and work to bring us to the

next stage of our evolution.

Governance structure

Soramitsu can always be replaced by a vote of
the Sora users, using their voting rights, if the
users are unhappy with the performance of

Soramitsu.

In this way, the Sora Decentralized Autonomous
Economy can continue indefinitely, even if

Soramitsu were to go away.

Sora @)

Soramitsu also helps with marketing and
development of the Sora Decentralized

Autonomous Economy.

For this, Soramitsu gets 5% of the money raised

by projects.

Voting Rights and XOR

Voting rights are distributed via the Sora Passport app.

iH B
The Sora Passport is the entry point into the Sora g,
economy. It manages the voting rights that a user | Jennipher Smith ©

has, allows users to vote for proposed projects.

Information

In the Future Sora Passport will also incorporate a
wallet, allowing users to send Sora (XOR) to

anyone in the world.
SORAMITSU

How are voting rights calculated and allocated?

First phase:
¢ Based on graph analysis of invitations among users
Future:

¢ Do analysis of the transaction graph for Sora transactions

(Find out who contributes to the economy)

¢ Look at the voting history of users and give voting rights based on how

successful the projects people voted for were

e Look at what kinds of Verifiable Claims are made about Sora accounts

Distribution of Sora (XOR) for projects that pass a vote

° 5% goes to Soramitsu
° 5% goes to users who voted

¢ 90% goes to the project

Why will Sora have any value at all?

People with only a vague understanding of Sora (XOR) will develop value as a unit of
economics and money often ask why things account by having real-world applications
like cryptocurrencies that have no “intrinsic build on the platform that use it as a in their
value’ have any value at all. Luckily, Bitcoin and system and require XOR for payment.

over 1000 more currencies provide an
existence proof that cryptocurrencies can have

value and can Function as money.

Economic Theory

The economic model in Sora is based on the disaggregated Quantity

Theory of Credit from macroeconomics research.

This theory has strong empirical support, showing that money created
for transactions that contribute to productive uses (e.g., creating money
to create a steel factory) does not lead to asset price inflation, but rather
expands the nominal GDP by the amount created.
SORAMITSU

Multiplatform

We want XOR to live across multiple platforms and
not tied to any one technology, but rather
transcend technology and work with many different

projects.

Currently, XOR is an ERC-20 smart contract on the
Ethereum decentralized blockchain and can also be
used on the permissioned Hyperledger Iroha

blockchain, using the Interledger bridge we built.

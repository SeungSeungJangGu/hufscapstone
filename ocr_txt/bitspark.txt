Introduction

We live in an age of ultra-high mobility. Advances in transportation and communication
technology have led to unprecedented numbers of people travelling, working and doing
business across borders. And yet, in such a fast-paced global environment, traditional financial
institutions have been remarkably slow to adapt. This becomes particularly apparent when
considering cross-border money transfers.

Money Transfers

There are more than 180 different fiat currencies in circulation, each varying in value, strength
and liquidity. Transferring these currencies across borders is expensive, inefficient and often
impractical. This is due to the global financial infrastructure which is characterised by tight KYC/
AML regulations, high opacity and a strong dependency on third-party institutions. Transactions
become particularly problematic when sending money to developing market economies with
weaker currencies where economic and political infrastructure is strained. Trading in and out of
exotic currencies is expensive due to low liquidity on the global market, and the consequent
need to route exchanges through strong currencies such as USD.

Apart from cross-border money transfers constituting an essential function for e-commerce and
trade, for millions of migrant workers sending money home in the form of remittances is of
critical importance. It is a multi-billion dollar industry that sustains families and developing
economies.

The World Bank estimates that officially recorded remittances to low- and middle-income
countries reached $466 billion in 2017. However, due to high transaction fees charged by banks
and companies such as Western Union and Moneygram, a staggering 7.1% ($33 billion) failed to
reach recipients."

The War on Cash

The remittance industry is facing a number of imminent and structural challenges including a
lack of reliable data on migration and payment flows, increasing KYC/AML compliance costs, and
high transaction costs which are still well above the 3% target set by the UN with its Sustainable
Development Goals. However, the single biggest threat facing cross-border money transfers
today is de-risking.

in-2017

De-risking refers to financial institutions exiting relationships with clients who are regarded as
posing a high risk i.e. those that predominantly deal in cash. It affects different types of
organisations including money transfer businesses, NGOs, NPOs and SMEs.

Banks are traditionally resistant to disruption and seem more interested in preserving power
han the prospect of financial inclusion. Their continuing disengagement is constraining the
future of the remittance industry and money transfers at large. Considering that businesses

providing cross-border transactions are in direct competition with banks, de-risking is essentially
a way for banks to secure their dominance.

Facing these challenges, businesses continue to look for alternative means to serve the cash-
economy. That's because for the world's 1.7 billion unbanked, the cash network is the only option
o send and receive money. The war on cash is a threat to cross-border money transfers, and
herefore of major concern for families in developing nations.

t is the perfect problem for a crypto-based solution.
In Perspective: Target Markets

Founded in 2014, Bitspark has been working to build an alternative system to address these
challenges and remove dependency on banks. Our journey began when we conducted the
world's first ever cash-in cash-out money transfer using bitcoin and we have since refined our
services to support a global network.

Bitspark’s solution first and foremost addresses the exclusion of cash-based economies, with a
focus on the emerging markets of Asia and Africa. In these regions, more than anywhere else,
cash is still the primary means of storing and transacting value.

For instance, Indonesia is among the major cash-based economies. In fact, it is the second
largest cash-based economy in the world. With a population of 250 million, only 36% of
Indonesians have a bank account. Credit cards, debit cards and internet banking are used by 1%,

8% and 5% of the population, respectively. This means that the majority of transfers, both
domestic and international, are predominantly cash-based.2

These figures correspond to other emerging markets in Asia and Africa where Bitspark is
working to serve people and businesses to live and thrive without banks. Bitspark's network
serves the Philippines, Indonesia, Nigeria, Ghana, Vietnam and Pakistan since 2015 until now.

The Bankless Alternative

The parallel financial ecosystem which we have built dramatically decreases the cost of money
transfers, increases efficiency and speed, and effectively cuts banks out of the equation.

We do this by leveraging blockchain technology and crypto-economics. Specifically, we tokenise
existing cash networks using stablecoins as transport vehicles for fiat currency to travel across
any border and remittance corridor. Through our ecosystem, any of the world's 180 fiat
currencies can be exchanged and transferred at the lowest possible rate in the most efficient
way.

As firm proponents of decentralisation, transparency and accessibility, we designed our
ecosystem in such a way that it is easy to participate. To take part in a bankless financial future,
all you need is a mobile device with internet.

That's how we make financial freedom an inclusive option for everyone.

Bitspark’s Bankless Ecosystem
The Bitspark ecosystem is built on the Bitshares blockchain and consists of:

Channels

obile app

+ Web platform

+ Decentralised exchange (DEX)

Vehicles

+ Fiat-pegged stablecoins

nclusion Points : International vaults, Mobile and Shop agents.
ative rewards token Zephyr

Each component has its own distinct function as part of the bankless alternative, but they are all

interconnected and work in sync, providing different inclusion points servicing individuals,
businesses and traders.

Ecosystem: Channels

Bitspark mobile app
Focus: Individuals

The mobile app serves as a beginning and end-point in Bitspark’s cash-in, cash-out network
serviced by various inclusion points such as vaults, mobile and shop agents. First, it enables
individuals to locate their nearest Bitspark-affiliated inclusion point and exchange cash for
crypto. Using the app, a sender then transfers the tokenised cash to the receiver. Finally, the
receiver finds an inclusion point to convert crypto back to cash.

Users get instant access to the world of crypto benefits, without requiring any knowledge of the
technology that makes it possible. All they need to know, and they will as soon as they make their
first transaction, is that this way cash can be sent across the world in a matter of seconds at a fee
that was previously impossible.

Bitspark web
Focus: Business

www.bitspark.io 6 of 14
e bitspark

Bitspark’s secure web platform enables businesses to execute global transactions and manage
funds across currencies. It is also a repository for all customer due diligence information which
reduces the labour-intensive paperwork conventionally associated with KYC/AML requirements
when customers deposit or withdraw funds.

With this platform, businesses can continue to offer cash-based services to their existing
customers who have downloaded the mobile app. With a built-in function to instantly exchange
cash for any stablecoin at the exchange rate fed by the DEX, all remittance corridors can be
serviced. Furthermore, the platform is designed using a familiar workflow and offers simple
implementation with both browser-based interface and API integration.

Decentralised Exchange (DEX)
Focus: Traders

SparkDEX is Hong Kong's first portal to BitShares, the world’s leading decentralised exchange.
Purpose built for trading stablecoins, it is the engine that drives liquidity and price discovery
across currencies. This is what enables app users and businesses on the platform to transfer

funds across borders in a way that is faster, more efficient and cheaper.

Crypto traders play a vital role in growing the ecosystem as it is through their participation that
the cash-in cash-out network can operate with scale.

Ecosystem: Vehicles

Stablecoins

Cash entering the network is tokenised using stablecoins. This enables customers to conduct
their fiat transactions with the speed, efficiency and low cost of cryptocurrency transactions.

Bitspark uses trustless, crypto-collateralised stablecoins. Among all forms of cryptocurrencies,
trustless stablecoins serve a special function and utility. They are much less volatile than bitcoin
or altcoins and as they can be pegged to any of the world’s 180+ fiat currencies, they are highly
suitable for money transfers.

Inclusion points: international vaults, mobile and shop agents

Inclusion points such as international vaults, mobile and shop agents, enable cash to enter and
exit Bitspark’s ecosystem. International vaults specifically service businesses as an alternative to

www.bitspark.io 7 of 14

bank accounts for cash deposits. We tokenise these cash deposits which adds liquidity to our
entire ecosystem.

Mobile and shop agents function in a similar fashion, enabling individuals to convert cash to
crypto and vice versa.

Zephyr

Zephyr (ZEPH) is Bitspark’s native rewards token, designed to incentivise usage and growth of
the ecosystem. It is awarded to customers for every transaction, top up, referral and cash-
withdrawal. The value of ZEPH is engineered to increase through our buy-back mechanism. Buy-
backs take place at random times over the period of 30 days, when we re-invest 25% of all
commissions earned across Bitspark’s business.

Cross-border money transfers

The advantages of our bankless alternative become apparent in a side-by-side comparison of
conventional channels and Bitspark’s money transfer process within the same remittance
corridor. Let's asses this in the context of Sub-Saharan Africa.

Sub-Saharan economies are largely cash-based, with around a third of its population unbanked2
Apart from global remittances, regional remittances are both common and problematic.
Generally, there are two options available to transfer money across borders: via banks or
through cash-based retail channels such as Western Union.

Bank option

Transferring money across borders through banks is an incredibly complex and opaque process.
The multi-hop model of correspondent banks and currency exchanges causes friction, delay and
exorbitant charges. The process is shrouded in mystery and customers have no clear visibility
into how their money is moving across borders, when it will arrive and how much it will cost.

Retail channel

When it comes to retail channels, the main problem with dominant service providers, such as
Western Union and MoneyGram, lies not so much in its inefficiency, but in the power they wield
as monopolistic middle-men. These companies charge extortionate fees, usually hidden in
exchange rates.

The Bitspark Alternative

In stark contrast, our bankless alternative offers a completely new way of transferring money
across borders utilising cutting-edge technologies, inclusive of the existing cash-based economy.
The Bitspark ecosystem is both faster than the banking channel and more cost-effective than its
retail counterparts.

With Nigeria as the main source of remittance inflows for Ghana,‘ the Ghana-Nigeria corridor

serves as a case in point. For our comparison, we use global average fees for bank transfers and
focus on Western Union due to its hold on retail.

Stablecoins

Best understood as price stable cryptocurrencies, stablecoins are highly suitable for cross-
border money transfers. They are robust in terms of their ability to accommodate reasonable
fluctuations and float on an open market. Stablecoins are either fiat collateralised and trusted or
crypto collateralised and trustless.

Fiat collateralised

+ With this form of stablecoin, each token is collateralised by an equal amount of fiat currency,
usually held by a central custodian. Holders of these tokens are guaranteed to redeem their
token at any point for the value in fiat.

+ The downside of this type of stablecoin is it that poses a counter-party risk: it requires a
trader's good faith in third-parties with regard to the presence of sufficient collateral that backs
the stablecoin in question.

Crypto collateralised

+ Crypto collateralised coins are backed up by reserves of another cryptocurrency. This makes it
possible to create decentralised and more trustworthy stablecoins. To counteract the volatility
of the reserve crypto pool, the stablecoins are often over-collateralised to absorb major price
fluctuations.

- Trustless stablecoins form the core of Bitspark’s ecosystem. Specifically, we use BitAssets which
are backed up by 200% of BitShares’ native token, using smart contracts.

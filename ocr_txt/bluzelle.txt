1. INTRODUCTION

To level the technological power structures and access to information through

decentralization.

11. The Problem

Blockchain technologies are propelling the next generation of the Internet. Protocols like
Ethereum are a platform for launching decentralized applications (dApps) that will change the way
products and services are consumed. These dApps will exchange massive amounts of data that
need to be stored and managed. The problem is blockchains like Ethereum are not designed for

data storage and management; doing so would take up too much space and take too much time.

1.2. The Solution - Bluzelle

Just like decentralized services like Filecoin and Storj are needed for file storage & management;
there is a need for data storage & management. Bluzelle is a decentralized database used by
software developers to achieve unprecedented security and scale. Bluzelle fills a need and is
complementary to the other components to make the decentralized Internet complete. Without
these decentralized components, the decentralized Internet would not be able to run efficiently

and scale to massive use.

3. THE GURRENT STATE OF DATABASE SERVICES

It’s estimated that in 5 years there will be over 20 Billion connected devices that require the

generation, management, storage, and retrieval of enormous amounts of data.

“Business leaders demand next-generation applications and new insights to drive more
intelligent engagement and better decisions. To get there, enterprise architects need to design
an agile technical architecture that can scale automatically with capabilities, such as databases,
that are always available to support new initiatives. It takes enormous time, effort, and
coordination to provision new databases today because of a lack of resources to meet the
administration challenges of rolling out complex clustered systems.” Forrester Research, 2017

Market Overview Database As A Service

To address this problem, emerged the Cloud Database and Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS)
market. According to Markets and Markets, this industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 67.30% to
$14.05 billion by 2019. There are four primary drivers of demand for DBaaS:

¢ Consumer personalization apps - financial, dating, social media products
e Internet-of-things (loT) applications - everything is being connected
¢ Mobile apps - amount of data consumed is growing exponentially

e Line-of-business (LoB) collaboration - business units share more info

With all these applications producing more and more data, past and present database
management services are under-equipped to meet the needs of businesses. There are problems
centered around performance, reliability and scalability. These can lead to problems of data

breaches resulting in massive amounts of data theft.
The systems of the past and present will now evolve to the future: The Bluzelle decentralized,

on-demand, database service.

4. BLUZELLE FEATURES

Bluzelle is a decentralized database service for dApp developers. To ensure developers get the
highest throughout in performance, reliability and scalability, Bluzelle implements swarming
technologies. A swarm is a large group of nodes (computers) that work together to store and
manage data. Nodes in these swarms can go down and new nodes can come up with minimal

impact on the network. Overall Bluzelle is a meta-swarm comprised of multiple swarms.

41. Performance

Bluzelle’s unique and proprietary swarming techniques were designed for the highest
performance. Bluzelle can reduce latency by retrieving data from the nearest nodes on the leaf
swarm, and/or increase speed manyfold by retrieving data in parallel from the fastest nodes on
the leaf swarm. This is like torrents and seeds. When data is requested, it is done in parallel
where chunks (shards) are requested from all the different swarms that contain those shards, and

these are all retrieved in parallel, resulting in desirable performance metrics.

4.2. Reliability

Using the concept of fog or swarm computing, Bluzelle follows a model where every unit of data
is 100% replicated in a single leaf swarm amongst a swarm of swarms. So while the data is only in
one swarm, that swarm’s nodes are aplenty and are geographically dispersed, immune to localized

outages caused by either natural or human-related events.

4.3. Sealahility

Scalability is possible both horizontally or vertically. Bluzelle manages the various strategies and
considerations around the use case of having to increase scale. Horizontal scaling is a
cornerstone of the Bluzelle architecture, where every swarm is another “unit” of horizontal
scaling at the metaswarm level. Within every leaf swarm, every node acts as yet another agent of

horizontal scaling, at the leaf swarm level.

11
The following table outlines additional features of Bluzelle.

FEATURE

Highest privacy

DESCRIPTION

Bluzelle employs cryptography and sharding techniques to provide a

privacy guarantee.

High reliability

Bluzelle redundantly stores tiny pieces of data on nodes across the

globe, eliminating any single point of failure.

Enterprise scalability

Data immutability

High performance speeds

Low cost

‘SWARM

Bluzelle algorithms store data in a unique, distributed and intelligent

manner that will provide enterprise-level scalability.

Bluzelle leverages blockchain technology so that once data is stored to

such a network, it is impossible to change that data.

Bluzelle dynamically adjusts the number and location of nodes sharding

the consumer’s data to meet performance metrics.

Bluzelle’s use of consensus is the only method by which updates to the

network can be accepted as the “truth”.

Bluzelle operates few data centers and has little capital costs. Vast

majority of computer resources are provided by participant producers.

8. HOW DOES BLUZELLE WORK?

Bluzelle takes blockchain principles and sharding & partitioning concepts to create an AirBnB
like marketplace for data storage and management. This is a crypto-economic network of

powerful producers and consumers.

The consumer is the one who “consumes” the Bluzelle database services. These are the
developers we target. Consumers are spending Bluzelle tokens so they can store and retrieve
data. Additionally a user could get a credit of tokens if a producer failed to meet certain service

levels.

The producer is the one who provides resources to the network in return for earning Bluzelle
tokens (BLZ). Bluzelle producers will be required to put up a proportional stake of Bluzelle tokens,
in order to provide a guarantee on the service levels Bluzelle will provide. Bluzelle will encourage
competition by producers to provide higher quality services, where those with higher service

levels can charge more but also have to put up a higher stake.

Every participating consumer and producer of Bluzelle are initially required to independently
create their own Ethereum account and take responsibility for securing and protecting their
private key. The private key is used to secure access to their ETH and Bluzelle tokens and encrypt

their data before it gets sent out over the Bluzelle network.

6. DAPP USES GASES FOR BLUZELLE

61. Predictions Markets

Decentralized predictions markets on Ethereum require the management and storage of massive
amounts of data to work. These include: (1) the questions being asked, (2) the different possible
outcomes, (3) the predictions being made, and (4) the sourced information for the actual events.
A decentralized database can grow and scale as per the products needs. Having fast and reliable
access to data is important for the success of the predictions market to garner new customers
and participation. Historical data stored on Bluzelle will add a new category of predictions that

can reduce human speculation by using past events to make better predictions.

6.2. Currency Exchange Protocols

A key part of a currency exchange protocol is the presence of relayers, who enable makers and
takers to connect via off-chain order books. The underlying order-books must be fast, efficient,
reliable, and easy to supply, by the relayers. A pain point is relayers are responsible to store these
order-books each in their own way. By using a decentralized database like Bluzelle, currency
exchange protocols can provide relayers with a standard, consistent, ubiquitous, database that
would be available with no effort. This reduction in friction maximizes the service level and

quality as the network would now still be powered by relayers.

6.3. Data Streaming Networks

Data streaming networks match up consumers of data points with producers of data points. For
example a car uses real-time traffic data from the data streaming network. The car collects real-
time data while it moves. It is both paying for data it "buys" and "earning" from data it "sells" to
the network. The data points need to be both readable and writable with high performance,
availability, scalability, and reliability. Bluzelle is ideal to provide the precise infrastructure needed

so that a data streaming network can store its data to meet these requirements.

14
7. MARKETING STRATEGY

71. Target Market

Bluzelle has three groups that it targets to become a mainstream product like Oracle Systems.

Bluzelle will start the first with the first group and then expand outwards.

e Early Adopters - dApp developers.
One of the fastest growing
segments in the software industry. LATEMAJORITY
It involves software developers
writing blockchain based
applications that take advantage
of other decentralized
technologies that are

complementary to Bluzelle.

e Early Majority - small-to-mid size
developers. Refers to developers
that are not in dApps but building

common web, mobile, hardware

ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE
applications. These developers are ARCHITECTS

writing games, productivity
software, mobile applications, utility

software, and many other software products.

e Late Majority - enterprise software architects. The large enterprises who see how dApps

and other developers use Bluzelle and then have the validation to also move their data

storage needs to us.

45
72. Regional Focus

With it’s offices in both Singapore and Vancouver, Bluzelle is in a unique position to grow in two

of the biggest regions for dApps and the blockchain: US/Canada and Asia Pacific.

From China to Korea to Japan to Southeast Asia, this region is home to a fast growing startup
blockchain community. These startups require efficient and low-cost services. Many parts of
Southeast Asia are rapidly developing as major cities and high-growth economies. They are
leapfrogging legacy client-server architecture systems to innovative adaptive and scalable

solutions built for the future.

“Asia Pacific is anticipated to aggressively adopt cloud database and DBaaS solutions in the near future.
This is basically due to the increasing focus by small, medium, and large scale enterprises for the
purpose of improving efficiency and productivity via investment in technology.” - TMR Research Cloud

Database and Database as a Service (DBaaS) Market, 2017-2025

Bluzelle has an R&D center in Vancouver, Canada. Being in Western Canada/US gives Bluzelle a
strategic position to offer it’s product to the growing blockchain and overall developer businesses
in Seattle, Portland, San Francisco and Silicon Valley. Bluzelle’s founders, advisors, investors have
a history of working in Silicon Valley and have strong connections to build support in the worlds

biggest technology center.

These regions are just to start. Bluzelle is a global product that meets the needs of developers

everywhere.

23. The Bluzelle Developer Community

The first release of Bluzelle is planned for April 2018 and we have started building our developer
community. Servicing software developers has less friction as they can be engaged online and are
passionate about technologies that help them make better products quickly and easily. Early on,
we will get feedback on the product and build the ecosystem enabling both the producers and

consumers of Bluzelle.

16
We will have an online community site, go to hackathons, host meetup events, and much more.
As a tech company, Bluzelle’s employees have an organic network of peers, friends and
acquaintances who are the target market. As mentioned in the prior section, Bluzelle will be

doing various developer reach outs to many of the biggest cities in Asia and US/Canada.

17
8. BLUZELLE’S ECOSYSTEM

The opportunity to get Bluzelle into the hands of consumers is tremendous. A key is to build a
healthy ecosystem where Bluzelle is integrated to many technologies; making it easy for

customers to find Bluzelle.

8.1. Developer Marketplaces

Bluzelle aims to partner with leading software development ecosystems and establishing channel
partnerships that share revenue. Notable examples would include Heroku, AWS Elastic
Beanstalk, Redhat OpenShift, Google App Engine, and Microsoft Azure. With such integrations,
developers can quickly use Bluzelle’s decentralized database, just as effortlessly as they can use

traditional cloud database offerings - simply point and click.

8.2. Developer Environments

Development environments such as Android Studio, Apple XCode, Microsoft Xamarin and Visual
Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ, Unity3D, PhoneGap, and lonic are targeted for plugins and integrations so
that dApp developers of both desktop and mobile apps can easily integrate Bluzelle whenever

they have database needs for their games, enterprise applications, etc.

Blockchains play a large role in the Bluzelle ecosystem. Smart contract classes and instances are
planned to be deployed directly not just to Ethereum but other open blockchain protocols like

Hyperledger to enable dApp smart contracts to use Bluzelle for storage needs.

8.4. Operating Systems and Browser Tools

Operating-system and browser tools further enhance the developer's ability to access data,
whether it is from a GUI application running on their desktop or a browser plugin that enables

them to quickly store and retrieve table data.

18
9. THE BLUZELLE TOKEN

Bluzelle is powered by two tokens:

e Ethereum ERC-20 external token: BLZ
This externally-tradable token bridges the Bluzelle native token (BNT) with Ethereum’s
own native ETH token.

e Bluzelle Network Token: BNT
An internal token to Bluzelle alone that enables the Bluzelle crypto-economy, where

consumers pay and producers earn.

The need for an internal token is because ERC-20 tokens are too slow and expensive for real-
time database accounting. The BLZ ERC-20 external token exists to represent on exchanges for
customers to easily obtain to use the Bluzelle service. The BNT internal native token exists to
enable high-speed, zero-cost, and real-time database accounting. The BLZ and BNT tokens can
be interchanged via the Bluzelle token gateway. For the public sale, people will be purchasing
BLZ tokens.

When a new participant to the network wishes to use its services as a consumer, they will need

to acquire BNT tokens. The standard method of doing so is as follows:

1. Buy BLZ tokens on a crypto-exchange using ETH, BTC or other forms the exchange
allows.

2. Send BLZ tokens to the Bluzelle Token Gateway’s smart contract via Ethereum. The
gateway will issue new BNT tokens to the user’s Bluzelle network wallet.

3. The user now has BNT tokens, and is free to participate in the network as a consumer.

19
When a producer wishes to “withdraw” their BNT tokens, they use the following steps:

1. Send the BNT tokens to the special Bluzelle gateway.
2. The gateway converts the BNT tokens at a 1:1 ratio to BLZ tokens, and sends these BLZ
tokens to the producer’s registered Ethereum wallet.

3. The producer now has the BLZ tokens, and is free to transact with them on the Ethereum

network.

10. REVENUE MODEL

The BLZ <=> BNT gateway proposes a micro-transaction fee for every conversion going through
the gateway in either direction. The fee is charged in BLZ tokens and is sent to a special
Ethereum wallet owned by Bluzelle. The model is setup so the entire ecosystem remains
completely decentralized while still providing a revenue for Bluzelle to improve and innovate the

network and its associated services.

Following are two typical scenarios:
e Auser needs BNT tokens to use the service.
1. The user sends 100 BLZ to the BLZ smart contract.
2. 0.1 BLZ is subtracted from the total of 100 BLZ and is sent to the Bluzelle
Ethereum wallet as a non-refundable fee.
3. The remaining 99.9 BLZ is converted to BNT and credited to the user’s BNT
Bluzelle native wallet.
e Auser wishes to convert BNT to BLZ.
1. The user sends BNT tokens to the BNT gateway.
2. The BNT tokens are converted at a BLZ 1:1 rate, resulting in a conversion amount
of 100 BLZ. 0.1 BLZ are subtracted from the total of 100 BLZ and is sent to the
Bluzelle Ethereum wallet as a non-refundable fee.
3. The remaining 99.9 BLZ is released out of custody by the Ethereum smart

contract and sent to the correct participant’ s Ethereum wallet.

Absolute prices are calculated dynamically and are not 100% deterministic. Maximums are baked
into Bluzelle, where the network adjusts the number of swarms and distribution of nodes as
prices start to approach the maximums, getting increasingly aggressive with network adjustments

as the maximums draw nearer, until expected average prices start to trend again.

21
Tl. TECHNOLOGY OVERVIEW

This section provides an overview of Bluzelle’s technology architecture. For a more in-depth reading

with more details refer to the Technology Paper.

111. Database 101 - CRUD API

CRUD stands for “create, read, update, and delete” for the four basic functions pertaining to
databases and permanent storage. CRUD covers the functionality of relational databases, where
each of create, read, update, and delete can be mapped to corresponding SQL and HTTP

methods.

A password of the user’s own choosing is also required, and it is up to the user to protect this
password and keep it available for later. All the data stored in key value pairs are encrypted, with
the password being used as the initialization vector in AES 256 symmetric key encryption. This

password is only ever used locally and never travels on the network in any way, shape, or form.

Shard stands for “System for Highly Available Replicated Data”. Large databases often are hard to
work with due to the size and memory constraints they come with. By partitioning the database

along logical lines, the database becomes much easier to work with.

A logical shard is the smallest unit in Bluzelle and contains individual units of data that all share
the same partition key. A partition key is a unique identifier that allows the shard to be accessed
for the retrieval of information. In Bluzelle, partition keys allow the dApp to store and retrieve
data from the correctly identified leaf swarm efficiently. In Bluzelle, groups of logical shards are
stored on leaf swarms, and it is the amalgamation of these leaf swarms that makes up the

entirety of the Bluzelle database.

22
11.3. Jump Consistent Hashing

Jump consistent hashing (JCH) was first described in a white paper by John Lamping and Eric
Veach at Google. It is an elegant algorithm that only takes about 5 lines of code in a language like
C++. JCH does not have a state machine, and therefore requires no storage. It is an algorithm

without lookups in memory and is therefore much faster.

Bluzelle uses JCH to map from the key (in key value pairs in a NoSQL table) to the id of the
swarm that the key is replicated in. Once that id is found, Bluzelle uses Kademlia hashing to find

the means to reach that swarm even if that specific swarm is not running.

11.4. Kademlia Hashing

Kademlia is an advanced form of a typical peer-to-peer distributed hash table which has been
structured in a way to make particular use of the special symmetric and geometric properties of
the bitwise XOR function. Bluzelle uses Kademlia hashing to efficiently enable nodes to know
about every other swarm on the network. Using Kademlia’s own form of “finger tables”, each
node in the network only needs to know information about how to reach O/log(n)) other leaf
swarms, where n is the total number of leaf swarms on the network. This means that irrespective
of how large the network ever becomes, every node can reach every other leaf swarm within
O(log(n)) tries, by only storing O(log(n)) data. As a result, Bluzelle is able to handle exponential
growth.

11.5. Partial Replication

Partial replication means that not every node in the network has a copy of the data -- only the
nodes within the leaf swarm delegated to that data replicate it. This is one of the key differences
between Bluzelle and a traditional “blockchain”. Blockchains are inherently slow and do not scale
well, as every set of transactions or blocks is 100% replicated everywhere, putting severe vertical
scaling limitations on the network. Bluzelle by design only stores the data amongst a strategic
subset of the nodes, statistically providing an guarantee that the data is always available and still

achieving the benefits of boundless horizontal scaling. Partial replication exists because only ONE

23
swarm amongst all the swarms in the network replicates a given piece of data. An interesting

incumbent technology that can be compared to this is the content delivery network (CDN).

11.6. Load Balancing

A benefit of having a logical shard stored on multiple physical nodes is speed - by having the
same data accessible through different hardware resources at various geographical locations, the
system may load-balance queries to retrieve data from nearby nodes that are least taxed at any
given moment in time. This permits Bluzelle to dynamically perform queries and retrieve data in
the most efficient way possible, maximizing use of the shared resources spanning across multiple

nodes.

11.7. Redundancy

As replicated data is stored across different nodes with unique infrastructure, there is a severely
reduced causation between single-node failure and loss of the shard. This method of mirroring
serves to secure the availability of data in an efficient manner by ensuring any single point of

failure is inconsequential.

Bluzelle deals with consensus differently from blockchains, doing away with any concept of a
network-wide universal state. There is no need for a single state for the whole network, so
Bluzelle applies the consensus model on a swarming level, ensuring that leaf swarms of nodes
storing data shards are each reaching localized consensus, using our customized forms of

consensus and proof algorithms .
A swarm with consensus appears to clients interacting with that swarm (or other swarms

interacting with the swarm) as a single, atomic, indivisible unit that stores a set of data reliably.

Any node in that leaf swarm can accurately service requests pertaining to that data.

24
Every producer on Bluzelle is entitled to run one or more nodes on the network as farming
nodes. Each such producer will use their Ethereum address as the “key” that identifies them. This
identifier is unique to that farmer and is tied 1:1 with their Ethereum address. The producer also
has a “Karma Index”, which is a score that dictates how well-behaved the producer is. The karmic
index can go up and down depending on the producer’s activities and decisions, intentional or
not, autonomous or not, and spans all the nodes the producer operates. If one such node
misbehaves, the karmic index typically drops and this applies to all the producer's nodes.
Furthermore, the farmer is required to put up a stake (in BNT tokens) that is proportional to the

number of nodes and inversely proportional to the karmic index.

11.10. Sybil Attacks

Some blockchain networks, like Bitcoin, allow anyone to add their node to the network. That
brings the concern that a malicious organization could potentially add so many nodes that they
disproportionately control the network and leading to hijacking the network. This is referred to as
a Sybil attack. Bitcoin and Ethereum obviate Sybil attacks by making them prohibitively expensive

via proof of work. |

Bluzelle employs several methods to prevent Sybil attacks so that when a bad actor is caught,
they can be blacklisted, and economically penalized leading to complete removal from the

network. These anti-Sybil attack methods are:

e Producers are required to put up a BNT stake to participate in the network. This stake serves as

a requirement for participation and as a strong economic deterrent from bad behaviour.

e The Kademlia distributed hash table is used as it relies on message redundancy and the XOR
distance function. Neighbours are selected and messages are redundantly sent to multiple
neighbors of the intended node for anti-Sybil verification purposes. Nodes that mislead the

swarm location effort will be systematically tracked down and caught.

25
e A request to a swarm for CRUD functionality is done with redundancy, where multiple nodes in
the same swarm all perform the request. Given the node->swarm membership rules for
Bluzelle, it is statistically unlikely that multiple such nodes chosen to perform a given

transaction are colluding bad actors that deliver bad yet consistent data.

e Swarm membership is determined by the network and cannot be chosen by nodes. This means
that a would-be Sybil attacker who attempts to join the network with n nodes or masquerading
with the identity of x nodes will not be able to gain a critical mass of memberships into any

single swarm.

e Nodes can be posed a challenge request to participate in a proof of storage test. This test is
performed in cooperation with the consumer on either a random network-initiated basis or by

the consumer directly and forces the targeted node to prove they have the correct data.

11.11. Byzantine General’s Fault

One way to protect against Byzantine Faults is to have a default understanding of what to do if
there is no information. In Bluzelle, if misleading or corrupted or inconsistent information is
detected, the default is to do nothing. Thanks to the aforementioned redundancy in CRUD
requests made to a swarm, inconsistency is caught, whether intentional or not. In any case,
Bluzelle nodes are instructed to ignore the transaction and do nothing. Only authenticated
transactions with proper credentials and checksums are accepted and transacted upon. By this

way, Bluzelle is Byzantine Fault Tolerant by design.

15. RISK DISCLOSURES

Please carefully read and evaluate the risks that Bluzelle Platform describes below.

The realisation of any one or more of the risks described in this White Paper, or other risks
whether unforeseen or unforeseeable, could significantly reduce or eliminate the utility or value
of BLZ and a participant (each, a “Participant”) in the proposed sale of BLZ (the “Token Sale”)
could lose their entire amount paid for BLZ. Bluzelle Platform does not represent that this
White Paper discloses all risks and other significant aspects of the Token Sale, including risks

which may be personal to proposed Participants and thus unknown to Bluzelle Platform.

Proposed Participants who do not fully understand or are not comfortable with any of the risks
described in this White Paper should consult their legal, commercial, financial, tax, or other

professional advisers; otherwise, they should not participate in the Token Sale.

To the maximum extent permitted by all applicable laws and regulations, Bluzelle Platform and
its affiliates and its and their founders, directors, officers, employees, advisers, agents, and
representatives (the “Bluzelle Related Parties”) shall not be liable for any direct or indirect loss of
revenue, income, profits, business, business opportunity, anticipated saving, data, reputation, or
goodwill; or any indirect, special, incidental, reliance, consequential, punitive, or other losses or
damages of any kind, in tort, contract, strict liability, or otherwise, arising out of or in connection
with any loss or damage of a Participant (or a proposed Participant) relating to the risks
associated with the Token Sale or in connection with erroneous or insufficient consultation with
or advice received from any adviser, even if Bluzelle Platform and the Bluzelle Related Parties

have been advised of the possibility of such losses or damages.

References to ‘Bluzelle Platform’ in the risk factors discussed in this section include, where the
context permits or requires, any Bluzelle Related Party involved in the operation of Bluzelle or the
conduct of the Token Sale. References to “discretion” mean “sole and absolute discretion”, unless

otherwise qualified.

32
Company Risks

Company Failure. As a consequence of the realisation of one or more of the other risks in this
White Paper or of risks not described in this White Paper, Bluzelle Platform’s business could fail
and Bluzelle Platform could be wound up or dissolved. If Bluzelle Platform’s business fails and
Bluzelle or the software platform on which it operates (the “Application”) is not transferred to
and operated by another company, Bluzelle would terminate and any BLZ would have no utility or
value. Bluzelle Platform does not commit that it can or will transfer the Application or Bluzelle to
another company if its business fails. If Bluzelle Platform does transfer the Application or Bluzelle
to another company, Bluzelle Platform does not commit that the other company will operate

Bluzelle to a Participant’s satisfaction or at all, or will continue to accept BLZ for use in Bluzelle.

Management Failures. Bluzelle Platform’s management may fail to manage its personnel,
finances, facilities, information, technology, and other resources to effectively develop, operate,
maintain, support, improve, market, and sell the Application and Bluzelle, or to manage the
growth of Bluzelle or its business, or to adapt the Application or its business to changes in
technology or the markets in which it operates, or to identify and effectively respond to the risks
described in this White Paper or otherwise, the realisation of any or all of which could adversely

affect Bluzelle.

No Governance Rights. BLZ confer no governance or similar rights with respect to Bluzelle
Platform, the Application, or Bluzelle. Bluzelle Platform will, at its discretion, make all decisions
concerning its business, the Application, and Bluzelle, including decisions to fork or discontinue
Bluzelle; to change any pricing, parameter, or feature of Bluzelle; to subcontract or outsource the
development, maintenance, support, and operation of the Application; to sell the Application; and
to sell, merge, or liquidate Bluzelle Platform or all or a material part of Bluzelle Platform’s assets,

any of which decisions may not be consistent with a Participant’s expectations or interests.

Business Model Risks. Bluzelle Platform designed Bluzelle (including the Application and BLZ)
according to a specific business model. In particular, the adoption and success of Bluzelle
depends on several factors, including:

*  Bluzelle Platform’s ability to hire top engineers to develop the Application and Bluzelle;

* the number of users providing resources to support the functions of Bluzelle;

33
* the availability of BLZ to Bluzelle users after the Token Sale; and

the number of users perceiving BLZ to be valuable and thus willing to use Bluzelle as

either providers of resources or consumers of Bluzelle.

If the business model of Bluzelle is flawed, or if the assumptions underlying that business model
are incorrect, Bluzelle may underperform or fail. Bluzelle Platform may at its discretion elect to
change the business model of Bluzelle in response to competition or market requirements, to
address perceived flaws, to optimise the model, or otherwise. Any such changes to the business

model of Bluzelle may fail to achieve their purpose and could adversely affect Bluzelle.

Insufficient Funding. Bluzelle Platform will depend on the proceeds of the Token Sale to fund its
operations until such time, if ever, that Bluzelle Platform earns sufficient revenue from Bluzelle or
other activities. The proceeds of the Token Sale are cryptocurrencies that may increase or
decrease in value. Bluzelle Platform may, at its discretion, engage in hedging or similar activities
to manage the risk of cryptocurrency fluctuations, but those activities may not be sufficient, may
fail, or may worsen the consequences of those fluctuations. In addition, the cryptocurrencies held
by Bluzelle Platform may not be convertible to fiat currencies or other cryptocurrencies at rates
Bluzelle Platform considers favourable or at all. The cryptocurrencies held by Bluzelle Platform
are also subject to loss or theft despite security precautions taken by Bluzelle Platform. If for any
reason Bluzelle Platform’s funds are not sufficient to sustain its operations, Bluzelle Platform may
have to reduce or suspend its operations, which would adversely affect Bluzelle Platform’s ability

to develop and operate Platform at the intended level or at all.

Unanticipated Risks. Bluzelle will be launched and will evolve in technology, business, economic,
and legal environments that are uncertain and subject to rapid, unpredictable, and potentially
contradictory evolution. The future risks associated with those environments, their respective
evolutions, and the interactions among them are unknown and unknowable but they could

threaten the viability or existence of Bluzelle.

34
Product Risks

Delay. Bluzelle Platform may not develop and deploy the Application according to its intended
schedule. Delays in deploying the Application may adversely affect the acceptance of Bluzelle in

the market and ultimately the viability of Bluzelle.

Inability to Use BLZ. Holders of BLZ will not be able to use them with Bluzelle until Bluzelle
Platform makes it them available (“Launch”). Launch may be delayed, or may not occur at all. Even

after Launch, the availability of certain services will be limited.

Failure to Develop and Support the Service. As a consequence of the realisation of one or more
of the other risks in this White Paper or of risks not described in this White Paper, or because of
business or technical decisions taken by Bluzelle Platform in good faith, Bluzelle Platform may fail
to launch Bluzelle with a full set of intended features and functions or at all, may discontinue
certain features and functions of Bluzelle, may not improve or add to the features and functions
of Bluzelle over time, may not adequately support Bluzelle, and may not fix bugs in Bluzelle in a
timely way or at all. Bluzelle (including BLZ) may therefore not have the utility described in this

White Paper or expected by a Participant.

Service Issues. Bluzelle may be degraded, interrupted, or fail because of hardware, software, or
network defects, security breaches, hacking, viruses or other malicious code, natural disasters,
congestion in underlying networks, and other causes. Bluzelle Platform may be unable to restore

Bluzelle to normal operation in a timely way or at all.

Service Updates. Bluzelle Platform may not update Bluzelle in a timely way or at all to fix bugs,
address incompatibilities arising because of changes in underlying technologies and services,
respond to user feedback, or react to competitive threats. Any such delays or failures could

adversely affect Bluzelle.
Failure to Meet Expectations. The initial and future versions of Bluzelle may not meet a

Participant's expectations regarding features, functions, performance, availability, quality,

security, scale, price, or other attributes that are important to a Participant.

35
Reliance on Third Parties and Third Party Systems. Bluzelle Platform relies on third parties and
third party systems it does not control to operate the Application and Bluzelle and to provide
services on which Bluzelle depends. Those third parties and third party systems may be unable
or unwilling to act as Bluzelle Platform needs and expects, may themselves act maliciously, or
may be adversely affected by other parties acting intentionally, unintentionally, or maliciously or
by other events outside their control. The failure of those third parties or third party systems to

perform according to Bluzelle Platform’s needs and expectations could adversely affect Bluzelle.

Privacy Risks. Bluzelle will rely in part on Ethereum and other public, decentralised platforms.
Anyone with Internet access can inspect all transactions and other information stored in those
platforms that is not encrypted. A Participant’s transactions involving BLZ, and other information
about a Participant or that belongs to a Participant that may be processed by or stored in those
platforms in connection with a Participant’s use of Bluzelle, may be inspected by the public.
Certain information may, even if encrypted, be associated with a Participant by combining it with

other public or non-public information.

Technology Risks

Core Technology Risks. Bluzelle is built with core technologies that are in some cases immature
and unproven, including the Ethereum blockchain platform and various open source software
applications and libraries. If those core technologies do not perform according to Bluzelle
Platform’s needs or expectations, have bugs or security vulnerabilities that are not or cannot be
fixed, become unstable, degraded, or unavailable, are changed or forked in a way that is
incompatible with Bluzelle, or are not further developed or supported, Bluzelle Platform may be
required to change the specifications of Bluzelle and to reduce or eliminate features and

functions that are important to Participants, or to discontinue Bluzelle.

Integration Risks. Bluzelle will be integrated using some essential third party services. If the
integrations with those services fail, or those services are unreliable or do not perform as
expected, those features within Bluzelle, or Bluzelle generally, may be adversely affected or

delayed.

36
Smart Contract Risks. Certain key features of Bluzelle will be implemented in smart contracts on
the Application and on the Ethereum blockchain platform. The nature of smart contracts makes
them difficult to change to fix bugs, improve performance, or add features and functions. Bluzelle
Platform may therefore not correct defects in Bluzelle or improve Bluzelle to meet market needs
or respond to competition fast enough or at all, which could adversely affect the utility or viability

of Bluzelle.

Hacking. All software systems, including the Application and the Ethereum blockchain platform,
have security vulnerabilities. Malicious actors may (a) disrupt, corrupt, or interfere with the
Application, Bluzelle, or the Ethereum blockchain platform, (b) defraud Bluzelle Platform or other
stakeholders in Bluzelle, including Participants or BLZ holders, and (c) steal BLZ or other valuable
data stored in the Application, Bluzelle, or the Ethereum blockchain platform, some of which may

belong to or involve Participants or BLZ holders.

Mining Attacks. Certain features of Bluzelle depend on the Ethereum blockchain platform.
Ethereum is a decentralised service comprising a global peer-to-peer network of many
independent node operators. Coordination or collusion among node operators could subject
Bluzelle and its stakeholders, including Participants or BLZ holders, to a variety of attacks that
could compromise the integrity of Bluzelle, cause loss, theft, or corruption of BLZ and other
valuable data stored in Bluzelle, including Participants or BLZ holders, or increase the cost of

using the platform to levels that make operation of Bluzelle uneconomic and unsustainable.

Security Risks. The security and integrity of essential components of Bluzelle depend on
cryptography. Known and currently unknown weaknesses in the cryptographic algorithms used in
Bluzelle and its underlying core technologies, and advances in techniques or computing power to
circumvent those algorithms, may compromise the security and integrity of Bluzelle, cause the
loss, theft, or corruption of BLZ and other valuable data stored in Bluzelle, including Participants
or BLZ holders, and require the suspension or discontinuation of Bluzelle. The existence or future
development of stronger cryptographic algorithms to replace compromised algorithms, and the
feasibility of implementing those stronger algorithms in Bluzelle and its underlying core

technologies, is uncertain.

37
Prohibitively High Transaction Costs. All transactions on the Ethereum blockchain platform,
including the transfer of BLZ, have a cost in Ether (“Gas”). As at the date of this White Paper, Gas
prices for basic transactions on the Ethereum blockchain platform are nominal. However, Gas
prices may increase and make the trading of BLZ on the Ethereum blockchain platform

commercially unfeasible.

Ethereum May be Superseded. In Bluzelle Platform’s view, the Ethereum blockchain platform is
the optimum blockchain platform from which to issue BLZ. However, the Ethereum blockchain
platform may be superseded by competing blockchain platforms that improve on the Ethereum
technology. It is not known whether the Ethereum blockchain platform will remain the
predominant platform for token issuances. If Ethereum is superseded, BLZ could be adversely

affected as usage and adoption declines.

Regulatory Risks

Regulatory Status. The regulatory status of the Application, Bluzelle, BLZ, and the Token Sale is
unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. Regulators in many jurisdictions have announced their
intention to consider the adoption of regulations to cover cryptographic tokens and the markets
for them. It is not known if, when, or to what degree different jurisdictions will interpret existing
laws and regulations or adopt new laws and regulations that could adversely affect the
Application, Bluzelle, BLZ, and the Token Sale, or whether those laws or regulations would be
applied retroactively. Adverse laws or regulations and/or the financial and other costs of
regulation could cause Bluzelle Platform to modify or discontinue certain features or functions of
Bluzelle, or cause Bluzelle Platform to discontinue the Application or Bluzelle in certain

jurisdictions or entirely, or make dealing in BLZ regulated or illegal in certain jurisdictions.

Excluded Jurisdictions. The Token Sale will only be open to Participants of jurisdictions where the
Token Sale (or similar cryptographic token offerings) is not prohibited or otherwise restricted. It is
a Participant’s sole responsibility to determine if they are prohibited or restricted from
participating in the Token Sale, or if such participation constitutes a breach of the laws or
regulations of their jurisdiction, whether by virtue of their citizenship, residency, or other

association with a jurisdiction which prohibits or otherwise restricts the conduct of the Token

38
Sale (or similar cryptographic token offerings). Violation of those prohibitions or restrictions may

result in criminal and/or administrative penalties being imposed on the breaching Participants.

Compliance Risks. Complying with laws and regulations that apply to Bluzelle Platform, the
Application and/or Bluzelle may be costly and may divert a significant portion of Bluzelle
Platform’s attention and resources. If Bluzelle Platform must have a licence or other government
registration or approval to operate the Application or Bluzelle in a jurisdiction, there is no
guarantee that Bluzelle Platform will qualify for or be granted the necessary licence, registration,
or approval. The lack of the necessary licence, registration or approval would restrict or prevent
Bluzelle Platform from operating Bluzelle in that jurisdiction. If Bluzelle Platform fails to comply
with applicable laws or regulations, Bluzelle Platform could be subject to significant legal liability
and financial and reputational losses which may adversely affect the Application, Bluzelle, and/or
BLZ.

Tax. The tax status of the Application, Bluzelle, BLZ, and the Token Sale is unclear or unsettled in
many jurisdictions. Adverse interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations or adoption of new
adverse tax laws and regulations could result in unanticipated and potentially retroactive tax
liability for Bluzelle Platform and other stakeholders in Bluzelle, including Participants and BLZ
holders. Those adverse tax consequences could cause Bluzelle Platform to modify or discontinue
certain features or functions of Bluzelle or increase prices for Bluzelle, or cause Bluzelle Platform
to make the Application or Bluzelle unavailable in certain jurisdictions, or make dealing in BLZ

subject to tax in certain jurisdictions.

Market Risks

Lack of Market Penetration. Bluzelle may not attract users and/or third parties providing services
to Bluzelle at the intended level or at a level sufficient to become or remain useful or viable. Any
such lack of use or interest could negatively affect the development of Bluzelle and/or the utility

or value of Bluzelle and/or BLZ.
Competition. Other organisations may develop (a) services that compete with Bluzelle, and may

do so with some or all of the open source software underlying Bluzelle or (b) cryptographic

tokens that can be used in blockchain platform-based database services similar to Bluzelle. Those

39
competing services and cryptographic tokens may adversely affect the adoption and use of
Bluzelle and/or the adoption, utility, and/or value of BLZ, and ultimately the viability and
continued existence of Bluzelle and/or BLZ. It is unknown whether or to what extent, if any,
those competing services and cryptographic tokens may be interoperable with Bluzelle or may

accept BLZ.

Secondary Markets for BLZ. As at the date of this White Paper, there is no public market for BLZ.
Virtual currency exchanges and other secondary markets for BLZ may never exist. Even if BLZ are
listed or traded on a secondary market, there is no assurance that an active or liquid trading
market for BLZ will develop or, if developed, will be sustained. Unless Bluzelle Platform publicly
states otherwise, Bluzelle Platform has no financial or other relationship with, and does not
endorse, any such exchange or secondary market that elects to transact in BLZ. Exchanges and
secondary markets may be new, under-capitalised, illiquid, volatile, operated by persons with
minimal or no relevant experience, and subject to minimal or no regulatory oversight, making use
of them susceptible to a variety of market, financial, fraud, and other risks that could result in

Participants’ or BLZ holders’ loss of BLZ or other losses.

Price Volatility. The price of BLZ in the Token Sale may not be indicative of the price of BLZ on
public markets. BLZ have no intrinsic value at the time they are created. The price of BLZ on
public markets may be extremely volatile, may decline below the price a Participant will pay for
BLZ, or may diminish to zero in response to various factors, some of which are outside Bluzelle

Platform’s control, including, among others, the following:

(a) the volatility of the prices of cryptographic tokens generally and in response to events

that have little or nothing to do with Bluzelle Platform;

(b) general economic conditions and macroeconomic changes;

(c) changes and innovations in blockchain technology, the industry sectors in which Bluzelle

Platform operates, and other technologies and markets;

40
(d) Bluzelle Platform’s announcements pertaining to strategic direction, key personnel,
financial and operational results, partnerships, significant transactions, new products, and other

events;
(e) activities and announcements of Bluzelle Platform’s competitors; and

(f) third-party reports, recommendations, and statements regarding BLZ, the Application,

Bluzelle, or Bluzelle Platform.

Risk of Dilution. Bluzelle Platform will create and distribute BLZ other than via the Token Sale, as
described in pages 31 and 32 of this White Paper. In many cases those other BLZ will be
distributed for less consideration per BLZ than a Participant will pay for BLZ in the Token Sale.
The distribution of those other BLZ will increase the overall supply of BLZ in the market, and may
affect as well as result in downward pressure on the market price of BLZ. In addition, Bluzelle

Platform reserves the right to create and distribute new BLZ in one or more other token sales.

Market Perception. The market price of BLZ could be adversely affected by negative publicity,
social media commentary, rumours, and other information, whether or not true, about Bluzelle
Platform, the Application, Bluzelle, BLZ, the technology on which Bluzelle is based (including
Ethereum), and/or the legal or regulatory environment in which the Application or Bluzelle

operates.

General Economic and Market Risks. Adverse changes in general global and regional economic
and market conditions may adversely affect Bluzelle Platform, the suppliers and third parties on
which Bluzelle Platform depends, and users and prospective users of Bluzelle, all of which may

adversely affect the availability, reliability, performance, adoption, and the success of Bluzelle.

Participant Risks

Private Key Risks. Each Participant, not Bluzelle Platform, is responsible for securing the private
key that controls their BLZ. If a Participant does not know their private key, they will permanently
lose their BLZ. If their private key is lost or stolen, they could permanently lose their BLZ. If they

store their private key with a third party wallet or vault service, they will permanently lose their

41
BLZ if they forget and are unable to recover their credentials to access the third party service, or
if the third party service malfunctions, is corrupted or compromised, makes their credentials or
private key available to others, ceases operations, is hacked, or otherwise cannot make their

private key available to them or loses control of their private key.

Token Sale Process Risks. The process for participating in the Token Sale will be described in the
terms and conditions applicable to the Token Sale (“Token Sale Terms”) which Bluzelle Platform
will make available separately from this White Paper. If a Participant does not carefully follow
that process, they may not be able to participate in the Token Sale or purchase BLZ, they may
permanently lose the funds which they intend to submit as payment for BLZ, or they may
permanently lose BLZ which they have purchased. The digital wallet to which payment for BLZ
will be made (“Payment Address’), like all software systems, has security vulnerabilities. Malicious
actors may attempt to steal funds from the Payment Address, including by hacking it. Funds in
the Payment Address are also subject to loss or theft by other means. Each Participant accepts all

risk of loss or theft of their payments from the Payment Address.

Incompatible Wallet. The technical requirements for receiving BLZ will be described in the Token
Sale Terms. If a Participant uses a wallet or other technology that does not conform to those
technical requirements, or if they use a third party service whose wallet or other technology does

not conform to those technical requirements, their BLZ may be permanently lost.

Uninsured Losses. BLZ are not insured by Bluzelle Platform or by any public agency, and there is
no institution supervising and controlling the economy for cryptographic tokens. If a Participant’s
or BLZ holder's BLZ are lost or stolen, they will have no recourse unless they insure them at their

expense. Bluzelle Platform cannot issue new or substitute BLZ to replace lost or stolen BLZ.

Dear APEX Community,

What we have here is a development plan overview for the APEX Network, its block-
chain technology, and its ecosystem. At APEX we have a unique approach of build-
ing out our blockchain project - we believe that three fundamental aspects must go
ogether to ensure long-term success of the project 1) the technology itself and the
extent in which it can solve the problem it was set out to tackle 2) speed to market and
he real-world adoption rate of the technology (and the levers you set and create that
act as catalysts) and 3) the actual value delivered in a timely manner (in other words
ong-term sustainability of the project).

Note that this paper is not a whitepaper, in that it is not meant to focus on outlining

‘o the audience the technical workings of the blockchain itself, but rather is intended
o demonstrate a development plan with long-term use case and viability for growth.
At APEX Network and Chinapex, we also approach technology in an agile manner in
which technical design is improved with fast iterations on an ad-hoc basis.

Best Regards,
Richard Wang

The goal of APEX Network is through proprietary blockchain technology, foster deeper 1-to-1 B2C rela-
tionships, by giving enterprises newer optimized ways to approach marketing, CRM, loyalty, and customer
experience, and at the same time maximizing value obtained by the consumer in all B2C interactions.
The Data Problem

The best way to describe the current data ecosystem is that it’s broken for both consumers and
enterprises. For the consumer, data and the value generated via its use is typically completely out of
control of the consumer, who by principle should hold data a sovereign asset and retain data own-
ership. For the B2C enterprise, there’s a multitude of issues surrounding data transparency, quality,
cost effectiveness, and security, hindering the maximum potential of data-driven applications.

Centralized Data Ownership Model and Data Hoarding

With the advent of distributed computing and big data, a centralized data aggregation model has created a
number of efficiencies and breakthroughs for consumer data analytics, digital marketing, and in general Web
2.0. Business models that benefited the most from centralized data aggregation included but is not limited to
consumer data companies, internet companies, and media platforms - these business models typically focused
on “network effects” , “monetization opportunities”, and “economies of scale” created by amount and depth

of consumer data points with a “the more the merrier” approach. The centralized data ownership model has
proven to be very lucrative for such companies and their consituents, and are behind the core business model
that drives their profitability. Prime examples include Facebook, Google, Baidu (China) , Alibaba (China), Ten-
cent (China) and Naver (Korea).

This problem with this model is that it goes against the grain of the ideal model of data ownership, in which
contributors obtain a fair share of value that’s earned from the contribution, incentivizing more in-depth partic-
ipation instead of simply a one-sided model. A decentralized protocol that models fair data ownership model
between platforms, consumers, and enterprises is more ideal and healthy going forward.

Data Security and Privacy

Data security and protection of privacy is one of the largest issues in the consumer data space, particularly
because of the number of catastrophic incidents of consumer data breach or privacy violation of data stored
with internet and consumer data companies. Some incidents are examples of the security flaws of centralized
data storage, such as the 2017 Equifax data breach incident, which leaked close to 150 million sensitive identity
data, and multiple Yahoo data comprimises starting in 2013. Other major incidents can’t be classified as tra-
ditional data breaches, but flaws in design due to centralized data business models. The Facebook user data
privacy violation that occured in 2014 as a result of research firm Cambridge Analytica harvesting the behav-
ioral and psychographic data of 50 million users for political use was due to a product design loophole that
exposed the data rather than data storage security breach.

Data security and privacy issues don’t just affect consumers, they also affect enterprises that are looking to op-
timize their customer experience and lifecycle. In terms of the general consumer data landscape, if consumers
do not trust enterprises to keep their data safe, they are less likely to share much information and engage in
various interactions. With the influx of applications and different types of devices, including lol, close to 70% of
consumers worry about security and privacy risks. In lack of response from brands and enterprises and inabil-
ity to inplement measures (and lack thereof of an effective solution) have over 30% of surveyed consumers
believing that brands simply do not put consumer data privacy as a priority.

Consent and Legal Compliance

Consumer consent and legal compliance is becoming a significant factor that is shaping how the consumer
data landscape is moving forward. One prime example is GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), which is
set out to officially roll out May 25, 2018, tightens data protection rules for all companies in Europe and outside
of Europe for any data collected relating to and of EU residents. GDPR sets strict rules and practices for data
collection, consent, and processing for the enterprise and gives consumers more control and rights in data
access and erasure. The enforcement of consumer data rights and consent is not just a EU phenomenon but
can be seen in a wave of recent regulations in Asia as well, including China’s new Cybersecurity Law that was
already effective since June 2017 and Japan’s Personal Information Protection Law (effective mid-2017).

One primary theme within this wave of regulations is consent and control the consumer has over her own data,
and secondary point emphasized mostly revolves around stricter processes surrounding the storage and pro-
cessing of consumer data. The consent aspect has been for the most part in the past one-sided, with consent
protocol not implemented or implemented in a implicit manner. Decentralized technology can play a significant
role of how consent and layered permissioning protocols can become more fair, transparent, and automated.

Data Transparency, Accuracy, and Quality

For enterprises who actually acquire consumer data using compliant means - the quality, accuracy, recency,
and transparency of data source are the key factors to consider when trying to evaluate overall value. There
are two aspects that affect overall data quality and value - first is internal processes in collecting and managing
customer data, second is data acquired from 3rd party providers and sources. On the internal side, it’s purely
a best practice and technology problem - the process can be completely managed and the data is entirely
transparent from the start.

On the external and 3rd party side. data is typically acquired by the enterprise in structured and usable form.
The original data source, validity, recency, method of cleansing, and method of analytics is typically a “black-
box” to the enterprise user. To give some perspective of 3rd party data acquisition in practice - APEX Network/
Chinapex has studied our enterprise customers’ results with 3rd party data across over 200 companies. 3rd
party providers included Unionpay and data partners of China Mobile and China Unicom (largest telecommuni-
cation companies in China), and were connected into our clients’ data platforms via APIs using Chinapex’s flag-
ship marketing data product NEXUS. The results of our study were rather surprising - 23% of the data points
had the consumer gender wrong, and 27% of the data had a wrong device type/brand identified. We estimat-
ed the average data recency to be 4 to 6 months. We have come to a conclusion that a centralized black-box
model of data transaction via aggregated sources is difficult to give enterprise users the reassurance that i
needs.

Cost Effectiveness, Cost Control

Being able to having a say in determining the fair cost for any particular datum should be of importance to both
enterprises/brands as well as consumers. The centralized data aggregation business model of internet, media,
and consumer data companies do not allow that to happen, which by design goes against a fair data own-
ership model of consumers themselves setting the cost (and gets compensated as a result), or an enterprise
setting the cost, in the case of B2B transactions without a centralized platform or middleman.

As we see as a general theme here - centralized models in data ownership, storage, and exchange leave
many difficult problems surrounding trust, privacy, security, rights, quality, and cost-effectiveness on the table
unsolved, hindering the development of next generation of data-driven B2C interactions.
The B2C Interaction Problem

The data problem is only one side of the picture - on the other end there’s the interaction and en-
gagement layer that makes up the core of the B2C customer lifecycle. When we talk about engage-
ment, it consists of components such as channel of engagement, the customer experience, and lev-
el of engagement. Currently we have various channels of engagement being ineffective, customer
experience being subpar, and level of continuous engagement lacking. Brands try new B2C interac-
tion methods and channels, and new loyalty programs, but they’re only having marginal effects.

Data-driven insight combined with in-depth engagement is the future of
optimized B2C lifecycle, from awareness to conversion to maximum cus-
tomer lifetime value (CLV).

Significant Value Expended by Middlemen Networks

In this particular context, we define “middlemen networks” as any channel or layer that facilitates communica-
tion, interaction, or exposure between enterprises and consumers. Some examples arising from the scope of
“middlemen networks” may include media, ad networks, affiliate networks, advertising platforms, push notifica-
tion channels, 3rd party applications, etc. Some of these channels have one “layer” which delivers the method
of engagement directly to the consumer, while others have multiple layers nested within each other that take a
cut of the value (typically in the form of marketing budget) - examples include ad networks, advertising plat-
forms, and affiliate networks.

With the advent of programmatic marketing, using audience targeting via acquired 3rd party data has some-
what increased efficacy of the advertising, but questionable consumer data quality, media inventory quality,
and suboptimal cost effectiveness has not solved the core problem. There is minimal value returned to the
consumer for participating or partial parcipation in the engagements, hence no incentive for being involved in
a more in-depth manner. Looking at a couple numbers may be enough to put things in perspective:

- 56% of digital advertising are not seen (noted viewed) [Google/Double Click Study]

- $6.3 Billion of digital ads will be wasted on fraudulent activity or bots [ADWEEK]

- 23% of premium video ads is fraudulent bot activity [IAB]
- 58% of consumers do not trust online banner advertising. [Nielsen]

- 52% of consumers find push notifications annoying [Localytics]
Ineffective Loyalty and CRM Programs

Brands and enterprises from various B2C sectors including travel, retail, and financial services have attempted
to create their own loyalty programs of various formats, the most typical case using a point system in different
tiers of rewards can be redeemed. The results have been for the most part mediocre, and the process at times
cumbersome and not helping the customer experience in general. Reasons include 1) mainly purchase-related
behavior has been linked to rewards, not adding much value of the loyalty point system to deeper engage-
ment levels 2) redemption processes are cumbersome and options are limited mostly within the vendor’s
offering - brand partnerships require manual commercial negotiation process and cross-brand redemptions
are complex due to unstandardized integrations.

Brands in general have had a hard time creating a loyalty solution that consistently increases engagement,
seamlessly fits into the customer journey, and enhances the customer experience on a continuous basis. A
ideal solution would need to provide consumers more tangible immediate value as well as optionality, and fit in
more comprehensively in the customer lifecycle and the customer experience rather being focused on pur-
chase behaviors.

In terms of CRM programs that focus on promotions and offers via notification and messaging channels, 55%
of them have not proven to deliver results. Studies have shown one key factor is that most CRM programs
have been more of a one-sided approach where the consumer views it as a solicitation rather than value-add-
ing.

Ineffective Solutions for Customer Lifecycle Management

Customer lifecycle management is often a tricky task even for large established enterprises with a strong IT
and data strategy. An optimal customer lifecycle management approach for the enterprise would enable the
brand to provide their customer a seamless and engaging customer journey across all the different touch-
points in the lifecycle, including online, at brick and mortar retail locations, and in mobile applications. To
achieve this, 1) comprehensive behavioral data needs to be collected at various touchpoints 2) cross-channel,
cross-touchpoint, and cross-source data need to be stitched together in unified profiles 3) suitable engage-
ment methods that fit in seamlessly with the entire customer experience.

Chinapex (Parent company of APEX Network) happens to be in the business of data-driven customer lifecy-
cle and journey management. Chinapex’s data management product, NEXUS has solved many of our 300+
enterprise customers’ problems surrounding integrating data across various touchpoints and data sources into
unified profiles - but still two key problems remain 1) data collected via the various touchpoints often are often
not deep enough to produce meaningful actionable insights 2) ways to engage the customer are often still
limited to direct marketing or push notifications, and produce a noticeable difference but do not change the
nature of the engagement.

Summary

As we see from our assessment above, optimizing both the data plus interaction layer is the key to improving
B2C relationships and the customer lifecycle, but we have seem to come to bottlenecks on both ends with
current technologies that do improve B2C engagements but not changing the nature of the B2C engagement
model. We see where the problem lies is in the structure of the value network for both the data and interac-
tions aspects. In the case of data - currently it’s a one-way street in which data aggregators receive the majori-
ty of the value followed by enterprises and then for consumers the least. The structure of this data value chain
creates problems surrounding privacy, compliance, security, cost-effectiveness, transparency, and quality. On
the interaction side a similar problem appears where either most of the value is expended via middlemen
networks or the consumer receives no value, or negative value in the form of solicitation. A paradigm shift is
needed in which value is balanced and driven by trust and balanced benefit-sharing.
Blockchain as a Solution

So far platform-level blockchain technology (excluding tokenized applications) has mostly been ad-
opted for the use case of cryptocurrency or the broader fintech (financial technology) space. Since
Bitcoin, there has been a proliferation of more general public blockchains which dApps (decentral-
ized applications) can be built on such as Ethereum, EOS, and NEO, as well as more use-case spe-
cific chains (Ripple, Filecoin, ICON, Ontology). In this paper we will show that marketing, CRM, and

B2C lifecycle is a unique be significant use-case in which adoption of blockchain technology has a
clear advantage.

Based on our previous analysis, below are key points of transformation that need to
occur surrounding the B2C engagement and lifecycle in order to optimize B2C inter-
actions to the next level:

These aspects of B2C engagement and interactions can all be optimized with blockchain technology. Any
problem concerning fair value distribution or value conservation (elimination or reduction of middlemen net-
works’ value expenditure) can all be addressed through smart contract technology combined with an im-
mutable distributed ledger. For giving more control back to the consumer over her data as well as enhanced
privacy and security, features such as encryption of data in-transit as well as using a encrypted self-sovereign
identity, combined with consent-driven data transaction protocol using smart contracts can change the existing
centralized consumer data aggregation and ownership model.

On improving the level of engagement, incentivizing for engagement, as well as providing more tangible
value for engagements, tokenizing value within a particular dApp or brand network, and then being able to
exchange the asset easily for other assets (ie. from other brands) on the larger network is disruptive new
possibility that blockchain brings to the table. This traditional CRM and loyalty programs haven't been able to
achieve.

With an enterprise-ready blockchain platform that is crafted for building data-driven and engagement-rich
B2C applications, brands and enterprises will be able to build custom dApps around the entire customer
lifecycle aimed at increasing trust, protecting privacy, enforcing consent, increasing the depth of interac-
tions, building loyalty, and in general creating stronger 1-to-1 relationships.
Scale of the Problem

Using blockchain technology, our goal is to solve and optimize the B2C engagement problems as
seen outlined earlier in this paper - which is not a simple single problem but rather a set of problems
along the B2C customer lifecycle value chain applicable to almost all B2C subverticals. The scope
of the problem includes marketing, branding, CRM, loyalty, customer experience, as well as using
data and insights to improve product design and other core competencies. Note that it is not the
goal to replace existing centralized systems, tools, and middlemen networks, but having decentral-
ized technology to disrupt parts of the value chain when it makes sense to.

Key Considerations

Given our understanding of the problem, the market, B2C customer lifecycle, and the target user
groups, the next question to ask is what would be some key considerations in designing an ideal
blockchain solution for the particular use case and purpose. These key considerations need to be
looked at at a holistic perspective - from both technical and commercial aspects, as our priority is
speed-to-value and adoption and technology is just a means in itself without use-case adoption.

Speed-to-Value

An ideal solution has an ecosystem in which network effects can be stacked up over time - one in which has

a healthy, growing, and collaborative ecosystem of enterprises/brands, consumer users, application partners,
and enterprise technology partners. For this to happen, it’s key for the process in which the enterprise exper-
iments and adopts the technology must be timely. This factors into various aspects of the blockchain project,

including built-in enterprise features, ease of development, SDK/API robustness, and level of support for POC
(proof of concept) stages.

Connectivity

Many applications and smart contracts on the blockchain need to be connected to the real world and integrat-
ed with existing systems in order to maximize real value - real-time data streams from external centralized or
decentralized applications and data sources is especially important for enterprise-related applications. Cur-
rently on most public chains such as Ethereum, connectivity to external data sources are realized through ora-
cles, but they are built as external add-ons rather than native modules usable easily directly through SDKs. For
enterprise to build and deploy real-time connected applications in an agile manner, built-in data connectors
and data middleware capabilities can significantly expedite the process. This is also important in the other way
around - easy implementation of triggers that send signals from the blockchain and dApps to outside applica-
tion and platforms.

Scalability

Performance at scale is definitely an important consideration for enterprise applications, especially for net-
works with over thousands of members. While most public blockchains that are available do not have a high
transactions per second (TPS) metric (with most below 100), performance limitations are increasingly criticial

to enterprise adoption moving forward. Consistent performance at scale requires architecture that separates
and localizes workstreams, uses optimized consensus protocols, and uses higher performance technology for
code execution. For a blockchain to be truly scalable, it also needs to be redundant in design to prepare for
major outages.

dApp Ecosystem

Depending on the primary application use case of the blockchain, the way the dApp ecosystem is built out
could vary. Ideally, the developer ecosystem creates apps organically over time, but if its main use-case is
enterprise heavy, we will need to focus on accelerating value and usable solutions first. To accelerate value,
the core developer of the project as well as strategic partners would need to develop or propel some basic
applications that fulfill an initial use case, and then either open source it or even release an SDK for customiza-
tion and quick development.

APEX Network

Vision

The vision of APEX Network is to build stronger 1-to-1 relationships between the enterprise and consumers
through proprietary blockchain technology - transforming how interactions, information, and value is ex-
changed throughout the B2C engagement process. APEX Network will help facilitate increased trust, privacy,
and transparency for B2C interactions. It will also optimize efficiency, cost-effectiveness and help eliminate
middlemen networks when necessary.

Another key component to APEX Network is connectivity, in terms of both connected information as well as
connected value. Information and data, when transacted using fair and transparent protocols, not only can
enhance B2C interactions and experience but also can facilitate B2B data-level collaboration and exchange.
Similarly, connecting and enabling the exchange of brand-assets, such as tokens and loyalty points, on a fric-
tionless platform provides a turnkey gateway to alliances and commercial partnerships that previously require
d manual arrangements.

Brands and enterprises will be able to rapidly build and deploy decentralized applications for use cases
across the customer lifecycle, including but not limited to marketing, CRM, customer experience optimization,
loyalty, and customer insights.

Platform Framework

The comprehensive framework of the APEX Network blockchain is 3-fold - the core blockchain layer, the ser-
vice layer, and the application layer. The core layer allows for the flexibility of transactions, assets, and dApps
to reside on either the main network or side networks (sidechains) for both scalability and enterprise ecosys-
tem considerations. For an enterprise to create new tokens or assets, it must occur on the sidechain, while
the main network still maintains full record of all transactions, as well as would be required for cross-sidechain
transactions. The APEX Network uses a delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) consensus mechanism for the main
network and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) for any sidechain on APEX Network.

Sidechains

APEX Network utilizes sidechains as one of the key unique features of the blockchain for 1) scalability of
standalone applications and localized transactions that do not need to apply to the entire network (in other
words enterprise user-specific transactions ) 2) seamless transfer of assets across main network and vari-
ous sidechains while keeping “workstreams” separate at the same time. Sidechains on APEX Network use a
2-way peg in which CPX and other assets can be transferred to and from the main network and sidechains.

To create a sidechain, a APEX Node Client will need to be run on at least one server, with the main account
meeting the minimum Supernode requirements, including amount CPX held (it requires at least one Super-
node to create an APEX Network sidechain). Unlike other blockchain sidechains in which different technol-
ogy can be used from main chain to sidechain, APEX Network sidechains can be thought of as essentially
mini-replicas of the main network with a subset of the functionality and permissions as the main network (ie.
sidechains cannot create and index additional sidechains). We recommend each enterprise user to at least
have one sidechain on APEX Network, depending on size of organization and breadth of use case, as well
as APEX core development team having its own sidechains for various projects and initial applications.

Consensus Mechanism

APEX Network uses Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPOS) as its consensus mechanism for the main network,
which uses a reputation system and real-time voting to achieve consensus. Delegates (Supernodes) must
hold a minimum amount of CPX before they can be eligilble to be voted. Once Supernode status has been
achieved, their main roles include 1) aggregation of transactions across the main network into blocks 2)
validate the transactions by signing and broadcasting the blocks 3) help resolve consensus issues in a
democratic manner. Typical Supernodes on APEX Network are expected to be run by APEX Core Develop-
ment, enterprises/brands, certain strategic investors, and application partners. In the initial phases of Mainnet
launch, APEX and Chinapex will provide technical and operations support on setting up Supernodes.

DPOS allows for major speedups in transaction times and minimize effort and resources required to run and
secure the network. For sidechains created extending the main network, a Proof-of-Stake (POS) consensus
mechanism will be used - for the purpose of growing the sidechain ecosystem in a scalable manner (maintain-
ing a localized delegated voting system per sidechain does not make functional and economic sense in the
particular use cases of APEX Network).

Supernodes

Supernodes on the APEX Network will receive rewards in CPX based on an incentives framework, which
specifications will be released in detail by APEX Network in May 2018. The dimensions in which total incen-
ive amount per Supernode is determined includes:

. The amount of CPX held in account

|. Total transaction volume of CPX across main network

ll. Supernode status

VV. Number of sidechains created and sidechain transaction volume

There will be a standard profit sharing of Supernodes to voters set in the range of 30-40%. Voters who
receive profits will be split into three tiers (There is a 50:32:18 ratio in weight difference in profits received
between 11/T2/T3):

- T3 - no minimum requirement on CPX held
- T2 - minimum 70,000 CPX required
- T1- minimum 200,000 CPX required

Smart Contracts

APEX Network utilizes a different smart contract system than typical public blockchains - our goal is to pro-
vide enterprise users with the largest flexibility, scalability, and confidentiality when necessary for their various
B2C (and B2B) applications. APEX Network’s approach is to create multi-layered architecture for smart con-
tracts, which consists of the data layer, logic layer, and middleware layer.

Data Layer - The on-chain layer directly running APEX Virtual Machine (APEXVM) defining the data logic and
schema on the main network or side networks. All data and transactions will be persistent on the APEX Net-
work blockchain.

Logic Layer - The logic layer is a secure layer that hosts the functional and business logic of the smart con-
ract. The logic layer does not need to be run on the nodes of APEX Network and can be run in the cloud

or a remote server. The logic layer consists of what APEX refers to as 1) The logic container and 2) the logic
package, which contains the custom code for execution. The logic layer will require digital signatures using
private keys, enclaves, and other features to perform cryptographically secure operations. The logic contain-
er wil also be able to expose APIs to connect with the middleware layer and other outside systems. The logic
ayer is what provides APEX Network’s smart contract scalability.

Middleware Layer - The middleware layer is the service layer that communicates with outside systems and
data sources, this is effectively the APEX Data Connector, which we will outline in more detail in the next sec-
ion.

Link is a proprietary data integration middleware technology developed by Chinapex in 2016 for the purpose
of rapid two-way functional and data integration of external systems and data sources into flagship data
platform NEXUS. The technology was used with large success by its enterprise user base and decreased
integration time and resources to nearly 15% of manual integrations.

APEX Data Connector consists of 3 main modules:
Adapter

The adapter module serves as the “socket” for all all major API and connection types to external systems,
including REST, SOAP, RPC, and MQTT. It serves a similar purpose to an API gateway.

FnTable (Function Table)
FnTable abstracts any API call to the adapter module into DNS-like pointers representing functions. Each

function has a specific rules and parameters, as well as return values. Original implementation of FnTable data
structure was using Aerospike on SSD persistence.

Mapper
The mapper is where virtually any type of integration regardless how complex can be implemented in an
efficient and simplified fashion. To create a map requires a setting up a mapping document in JSON or YAML
(XML-like) format. A map consists of multiple nodes in the structure of a DAG (directional acyclic graph), with
each node as a abstracted function from FnTable. If we imagine the graph having a left to right direction,
left-right represents primary importance of runtime execution order and and top-down represents secondary
priority. Return values of one node/function can be passed on to the next node as a parameter. The last node
will always by default the END node, which finishes the map and may have an optional return value dataset (if
the objective is to retrieve data from an external system).

EXTERNAL SYSTEMS AND DATA SOURCES
Personal Data and Transactions

One of the advantages of APEX Network is that it has built-in capability for data privacy, consent protocols,
and transactions protocols for both B2C and B2B use cases. We use a hybrid on-chain and off-chain consum-
er data management model that facilitates data ownership, transparency, auditability, and access control.

We call this data management protocol the APEX Transactional Data Management System, or ATDM in short.
ATDM is built as a native module in the APEX Virtual Machine and can be easily plugged into smart contracts
and decentralized applications. The basic building blocks of ATDM is as follows:

- In terms of smart contracts and APEXVM, ATDM acts as an object that has methods, input parameters, and
return valuies.

- To create any data transaction protocol using ATDM, the program just needs to create a new ATDM instance
and initialize it with rules and properties. (cost controls, preconditions, maximum transactions, etc). There may
be multiple ATDM containers per contract or dApp.

- ATDM has a fixed set of native building blocks to protect consumer data:
i. Identity management - for personal users, there are two types of data that are transactable 1)
unified identity data and 2) application data. Each user has multiple sub-identities associated with different
applications.
||. Access control - give access to enterprise users with a customizable set of policies.
lll. Encryption - encrypted data is routed from the blockchain (using SHA-256 hash) and stored off-
chain in a DHT (distributed hash table) run by a collection of Data Cloud Nodes. Consumers users will be
able to store a portion of their unified identity and personal data on the Data Cloud Nodes.

The Data Cloud nodes housing encrypted consumer data from the APEX Network dApp ecosystem will ini-
tially be hosted by APEX Core Development and infrastructure partners and eventually will open up the Data
Cloud to be hosted partially by the CPX holding-community, in which would include a separate rewards and
incentives program, which would come from data transaction fees.
Cross-Network DEX

Connectivity of enterprise and brand assets is prone
- through the exchange and liquidity of enterprise as

to become an important facet of the B2C ecosystem
sets (that can be exchanged for tokenized products,

rewards, items) across the blockchain, B2C interactions would have further augmented value and economies

of scale, as well as making B2B commercial partners

hips becoming more frictionless and effortless.

For APEX Network, it means that having a mechanism of liquidity and exchange across different asset classes

with CPX being the main traded medium - in other w

ords a decentralized exchange DEX protocol native to

the platform. Note that here simplicity, transactional speed, and liquidity is valued over actual “trading” func-
tionality. The ideal method of transaction is simply exchanging one asset for another through the CPX Wallet
or any custom enterprise wallets through the same APlI-enabled DEX protocol.

APEX Network will be building a CPX-based enterpri
enterprises, and partners to swap between assets. T|

se asset DEX that will make it easy for consumers,
he DEX will be built off of APEX Virtual Machine as both

a dApp and extensible protocol on the main network, and will utilize a multi-reserve approach for instant

liquidity. Each reserve, via a APEXVM smart contract,

can list asset/CPX trading pairs and control a price-set-

ting mechanism, and each request to sell or trade a certain amount of a particular asset will be transacted

with the reserve with the best offer. The reserve will
funds management from the reserve itself (ie. manag

have the option of separating reserve management and
ed through a 3rd party market maker or partner). This

approach is very similar to the DEX protocol of Kyber Network. We expect initial reserve holders to be APEX

Core Development, who will hold multiple CPX/asse
own CPX/asset pairs and that of their partners in the

pairs, our enterprise ecosystem, which will hold their
ecosystem, as well as investors and the CPxX-holding

community, who will have an opportunity to gain pro

It’s clear that there is a myriad of different on-chain a

it of transaction spreads.

nd hybrid (on-chain + offchain) approaches to developing

a DEX, but after evaluating use-case suitability we find this one to be the most suitable approach.

work provides boundless possibilities to build next generation consumer applications with opti-

CPX Wallet

The CPX Wallet will be the official and initial wallet developed by APEX Core Development for the main
purpose of storing and transacting both NEP-5 CPX (placeholder) and APEX Network Mainnet CPX, as well as
various assets on the APEX Network blockchain. An NEP-5 CPX and Mainnet CPX swap functionality will be
implemented directly in the CPX Wallet after Mainnet launch for the CPX-holder’s convenience.

The CPx-based DEX protocol will also be implemented directly in the CPX Wallet for maximum ease in swap-
ping across different enterprise assets on the APEX Network. Other features will include:

Unified data settings and permissions
Unified individual data and identity management, data permission setting for enterprise users and various
dApps.

Brand and reward discovery
Users can discover enterprises and brands that are a part of the APEX Network ecosystem, as well as discov-
er the rewards and products that can be redeemed using CPX-based assets.

Personal tags and attributes

Personal tags and attributes can be set as both a way for enterpises users to discover individual consumers

as well as data-level attributes that are transactable and monetizable for the consumer user. Initial implemen-
ation for tags and attributes will eventually be moved to a distributed hashtable in the Data Cloud Nodes as

described in an earlier section.

The development plan for CPX Wallet has been adjusted and optimized to the strategy of a public blockchain
platform - where freedom for enteprises to develop and customize their own customer experiences and
applications are a priority. CPX Wallet will provide the basic and standard functionalities and a DEX, but we
expect enterprise users to develop their own versions of an asset wallet for their customer and user base as
well. APEX Core Development will open source CPX Wallet codebase upon Version 1 non-beta release for
redevelpment use by the enterprise users, application partners, and the ecosystem.

Example Application Scenarios

B2C Data Transaction

APEX Network will make it easy for enterprises and partners to create privacy-focused, consent-driven, and
fair compensation data sharing and transaction protocols between enterprises and consumers. The proto-
col can be embedded within a non decentralized application or could be a standalone dApp built on top

of APEXVM. One or multiple ATDM (APEX Transactional Data Management) instances can be initialized in a
smart contract and the application can configure the ATDM instance to its requirements and needs. To take
extra measures to insure data quality, a data verification mechanism can be added via APEX Data Connec-
tor. Using APEX Network to build B2C data sharing protocols allows enterprises to build trust and a deeper
connection with their users, as well as stay compliant with regulations such as GDPR. The enterprise can set a
tokenized cost structure that it finds suitable - of course, the consumer can also determine the minimum price
particular dimensions of his or her data is worth.

B2B Data Exchange

The value of APEX Network’s data ecosystem is amplified when data transactions are also conducted be-
ween enterprises. The mechanism and protocol is similar to B2C data transactions but do not require an
ADTM instance to be in place. A protocol is setup via an APEXVM smart contract where terms and condi-
ions are configured for data exchange. The smart contract can dictate whether the data exchange 1) uses
data-to-data model and if so, what would be considered a “balanced transaction” 2) enterprise assets and
okens for data and a fair data valuation formula 3) or both. If it's determined that a 3rd party data verifier is to
be used, then a connection to an external data verification source can also be setup via APEX Data Connec-
or. Depending on the enterprise’s policy on compliance, a B2B transaction protocol with 2 or more partici-
pants may want to include a consumer consent step if it is transacting on consumer data, which can be done
easily be initializing an instance of ATDM within the smart contract.

A B2B data exchange protocol may be built on APEX Network by not only by enterprises themselves but also
by third party application partners and consumer data related companies.

Rewards Exchange/Alliance

Previously brand and enterprise reward points programs have been largely ineffective and silo-ed, meaning
that for the consumer they were not connected or transactable with that of other enterprises. And when that
did happen, often what it comes down to is manual business negotiations and sit-down meetings with long

decision cycles and more importantly, cumbersome and complex integrations. APEX Network has an out-of-
box solution that solves this problem. On the APEX Network, one solution is as follows:

1) Create an enterprise sidechain on APEX Network or have at least one running
2) Create a new enterprise asset/token on the sidechain - that asset can directly replace the legacy loyalty
or reward points system the enterprise is using. Code in the “points” distribution events in a smart contract
under different conditions and touchpoints.
3) To swap for another enterprise asset, simply utilize a DEX protocol on the APEX Network to first swap to
CPX and then CPX to the other asset. If APEX Core Development's DEX protocol is used, then instant liquidity
can be provided (via multi-reserve system, please refer to the DEX section of this paper for more details).

The approach described above is only the simplest solution that does not consider special alliances or com-
mercial arrangements. For two enterprises that have a special arrangement or a strategic partnership, they
are able to setup a structured exchange protocol via APEXVM smart contract according to special rules or
exchange rates, and can swap directly from asset to asset without converting to CPX first.

Interactive Messaging

Current studies show that around 52% of consumers find push notifications annoying. Typically when a
promotional push notification or text message appears, the enterprise has a particular purpose to stimu-

late consumer behavior into some type of purchase-related behavior. An ideal case is instead of a mode of
solicitation (the result may be switching off or muting notifications altogether), a value is attached to each
interaction associated with the message. This can start by opening the message, and then if the message is
a rich media format (contains text, images, video, etc), by interacting certain parts of the message or media, a
tokenized reward gets credited, and tokens can redeem rewards or be swapped for other assets. This type
of engagement method increases engagement depth, longevity, and reduces annoyance and solification-like
experiences.
The method in which we can deploy these applications is simplified via APEX Network’s architecture. The
steps would be as follows:

) A sidechain is required if an enterprise asset is to be used as incentive, or alternatively, a sidechain is not
required if CPX is to be used. Create a smart contract that serves as a controller for disbursing rewards to
public addresses on the network based on certain triggered actions - it may be necessary to connect the
contract with an external data source matching public key and some other types of identifiers (username,
device-ID, etc) using APEX Data Connector.

2) Create a simple API for the post message-opening action on either the landing page or within a mobile ap-
plication to track actions. Integrate the APi with APEX Data Connector and pass on corresponding identifiers
as parameters for matching.

3) The loop is complete and the consumer may participate in interactive messaging.

Gamification

Gamification in both the B2C sector as well as in the workplace has been experiencing growth in the past few
years, and has created higher engagement levels but often with limited longevity because it typically offers
little incentive for consumers. Using APEX Network to tokenize reward assets and use them in gamification
applications allows for an extra level of engagement, especially with the potential to exchange the assets for
other utility assets or cash (CPX).
Unified Customer Profile/Customer Experience

A unified customer experience and a seamless customer journey across multiple touchpoints is crucial for op-
timizing customer lifecycle management and CRM - but in fact it’s one of the most common and difficult prob-
lems that B2C enterprises face. A traditional approach would have been to treat each customer touchpoint
and channel separately (online, retail, mobile, partner network) and collect data to optimize customer expe-
rience for each of these touchpoints. Recently a better approach is to use unified customer data platforms
(CDPs), where data is collected from these touchpoints and stitched together into unified customer profiles
based on rules (ID-matching). This is a significant improvement, but guesswork is still done in the process and
is prone to non-matches, data cleansing issues, and inaccurate insights about the customer.

The goal to achieve a truly unified and seamless customer profile is still not achieved - and a large reason
is because the profile and data is collected, centralized, and analyzed by the enterprise and not owned and
managed by the consumer herself.

APEX Network enables enterprises and brands to build applications that enable a decentralized “unified cus-
tomer profile” controlled and managed by the consumer. Below we outline a basic approach that is one of the
various ways that customer experience personalization with a unified customer view on APEX Network can
be implemented.

[The approach we will briefly describe below:

) Setup a smart contract on APEX Network, exposing an API that the unified customer experience app will
use for the consumer to communicate with the smart contract.
2) Consumer manages profile and data settings in the app, which can set a confined structure for the da-
a-level settings (ie. only specific tags and numericals within a particular range)

3) Encrypted consumer data gets sent to the blockchain and routed to the DHT cloud where it’s stored.

4) Smart contract, via APEX Data Connector, will connect to a reference data source containing a “look-up
able” of rules for experience customization/personalization under various data-driven instances

5) Result is returned to the smart contract and signal is sent to the personalization or experience triggers
across different channels online and offline, again via APEX Data Connector. Channel/touchpoint detection
and selection is a non-complex mechanism (for example, to see if the user is currently online or in a retail
store) that the enterprise developer can implement.

Artificial Intelligence

When considering artificial intelligence combined with blockchain, we typically consider one of three possibili-
ties: 1) distributed machine learning via blockchain protocol 2) blockchain assisting auxillary processes related
to Al, including recording machine-made decisions on the blockchain and decentralized supervised learning
or 3) obtaining value from the blockchain and using it on off-chain Al.

For the purposes of the use case of marketing, CRM, and customer insights, currently the third is by far the
most valuable and quick to realize value. For this particular use case relating to customer interactions, most of
the Al-related applications used are related to predictive customer insights and natural language processing
(NLP), and for these applications the most crucial are the quality, depth, recency, and relevance of the data
being used for the machine learning models.

Data quality, cost effectiveness, and transparency are some of the areas in which APEX Network adds value.
Through any of the B2C or B2B data exchange protocols outlined above combined with use of external data
verification tools in particular cases, we have permissioned, transparent, and consented data that are higher

quality than the majority of the structured and unstructured data collected and purchased from various sourc-
es.

Chinapex, the company behind APEX Network, has been developing predictive Al technology since 2016 to
solve problems in marketing, personalization, and CRM. One of Chinapex’s flagship Al products, |Q, enables
enterprise users to use proprietary predictive machine learning, deep learning, and NLP algorithms to pro-
duce deep actionable consumer and customer insights across industries such as finance, travel, retail, auto-
motive, and internet. Particular pilot program enrollees of APEX Network are also existing enterprise users
and customers of our Al product IQ.

Upon testnet launch IQ will be the first Al technology integrated with APEX Network and used to test and
refine the Al-readiness of datasets acquired via APEX Network.

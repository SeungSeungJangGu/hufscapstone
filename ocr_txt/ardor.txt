This document gives a detailed overview of the Ignis
crowdsale* and the Ardor platform.

This document gives a detailed overview of the IGNIS crowdsale and the Ardor platform. The
aim of the document is not only to present the technical innovation and use cases
of the upcoming platform, but also to outline the business strategy and development
roadmap of Jelurida. The terms and conditions for the IGNIS crowdsale are available
in a separate document and, due to their legal significance, are integrated in the wallet itself.

Ardor is a blockchain-as-a-service-platform that
evolved from the time-tested Nxt blockchain. It is
currently successfully running on a testnet and will
be launched in Q4 2017. The unique parent-child
chain architecture of Ardor, with a single security
chain and multiple transactional chains, enables
three fundamental advantages - reducing block-
chain bloat, providing multiple transactional tokens,
and hosting ready-to-use interconnected block-
chains. To kickstart the Ardor project and allow it to
compete with the rapidly-growing blockchain
market, the development team behind Nxt and Ardor
decided to conduct a crowdsale for 50 % of IGNIS -
the token of Ignis, the first Ardor child chain. Jelurida
will be the corporate entity that will be responsible
for the development of Ardor and Nxt platform.

The Ignis child chain will be completely unrestricted
and decentralised with all features and functionality
which currently exist on the Nxt blockchain. Multiple
additional child chains can be created on the Ardor
platform for various organizations, such as public
entities, enterprises, consortiums, research institu-
tions, and financial service providers. The platform
technological innovations make it possible for large
corporations and SMEs to have a child chain with
ready-to-use features, instead of creating their own
blockchain and developing features from scratch.
Child chains can be implemented in a cost-effective
way without compromising their security, which is
guaranteed by the parent Ardor chain.

*Please note that the IGNIS crowdsale that is scheduled to commence on 5 August 2017 will distribute JLRDA tokens at
‘l owe you’ basis. The IGNIS tokens will be distributed to JLRDA token holders at 1:1 ratio when the Ardor platform is launched.

ll. Brief History

Amidst the rush of multiple clones of Bitcoin
being created in 2013, Nxt was introduced as a
second-generation cryptocurrency, expanding
the use of blockchain beyond supporting a cur-
rency and a simple transfer of value. Nxt is the
first blockchain protocol to use an entirely
Proof-of-Stake instead of Proof-of-Work consen-
sus mechanism, so its power consumption and
hardware requirements are very low. Ever since
the launch, the platform has been running
securely with 100% uptime and has experienced
no systematic failure. Actively used in produc-
tion and in a state of constant development, the
Nxt platform has been able to stand the test of
time due to its advanced architecture and solid
design. Being open source, it has also been sub-
jected to multiple code reviews by independent
experts from various backgrounds.

Implemented in Java, the leading industry stan-
dard language for corporate applications, the
Nxt platform allows for fast prototyping and the
rapid development of new features. Existing fea-
tures include creating and trading assets, listing
and buying of digital goods, creating polls with
very flexible vote counting options, setting up
conditional transaction execution, assigning
properties to accounts, sending encrypted mes-
sages, registering aliases, and many others. The
relative ease with which such new functionality
has been added regularly by the development
team every few months during the last three
years proves the well-designed and _ flexible
architecture of the platform. In addition, the rich
and comprehensive Nxt API which supports over
200 request types has allowed various projects to
be built on top of Nxt.

« Our accountability
ee All platform features, as well as the block generation process,
your contributions require the use of the native token known as NXT.

+ Testimonials :
Cc eles NXT is not only required for the payment of transaction fees to
the network and for the transfer of value, but also for all trans-
actions involving the use of the blockchain e.g. pricing of asset
exchange ask/bid orders, prices of digital goods listed on the
marketplace, exchange rates of monetary system currencies,
and the transfer of assets over the blockchain. This makes it
difficult to develop applications which use the blockchain
transparently, as ideally, users should not be required to have
NXT in order to transact and shouldn’t need to denominate the
value of assets and currencies in NXT.

b. Blockchain Bloat

Why do all nodes need to be burdened with
storing and reprocessing all transactions?

Blockchain bloat is acommon problem across all
blockchain platforms, including Nxt. It is due to
the fact that every node needs to store all trans-
actions ever processed since the blockchain was
started. New nodes are also required to re-pro-
cess all data when they download the blockchain
for the first time. This is a security requirement
stemming from the trustless design of block-
chain platforms. Being a proof-of-stake crypto-
currency, the balance of an account (its stake) at
a given blockchain height determines, in a pseu-
do-random manner, whether this account is
eligible to generate (forge) the next block. For a
node downloading the blockchain from scratch,
the only way to verify that the next block it is
downloading was indeed generated by a legiti-
mate account (i.e. having sufficient stake), is to
make sure that it calculates and verifies each
account balance as it downloads the blockchain
by processing all old transactions it encounters
during the download. This represents a process-
ing bottleneck that will only get worse as the
blockchain size increases, especially with the

rising number of transactions per second. At the
current transaction processing rate bloat is not
yet a problem for Nxt, and we have already come
up with several innovative solutions to reduce it
even more. One such solution is the prunable
data function which allows for the removal of
some data like messages from the blockchain,
thus reducing its size, yet when needed automat-
ically restoring such data in a trustless manner
from archival nodes. However, bloat is a serious
issue that must be solved in a fundamental way
in order for a blockchain platform to be
future-proof and truly scalable.

c. Customization Issues

Cloning is simple, but maintenance is not!

Many organizations need a custom blockchain with
its own transactional token and customized func-
tionality for their needs. To achieve this with the Nxt
software, an organization needs to create a clone -
i.e., a completely separate blockchain, running
a modified version of the software, but not linked in
any other way to the original Nxt blockchain. Doing
so requires the setup of servers to process transac-
tions and to secure the network, as well as complex
development work for the customizations. In addi-
tion to being a burden for most small-to-medium
businesses, this lowers the system security, as com-
pared to the main public Nxt blockchain. Such
a clone is also bound to lag behind the latest public
chain software in terms of feature development and
security upgrades, since implementation of cus-
tomized blockchains is a complex matter, especially
if one is not very experienced with the Nxt software.

Ill. Technological Overview

With Ardor, network security tokens and transactional tokens are separate

The above-mentioned problem led the Nxt
developers to work on a new solution, start-
ing from Q2 of 2016, which gave birth to the
Ardor protocol. In the Nxt blockchain, it is the
NXT token that serves this dual purpose,
being used both to determine forging stake,
i.e. the right of an account to generate blocks,
and to execute all kinds of value-transfer
transactions, i.e. represent a unit of value. In
Ardor, a separation of these two functions is
used to achieve much greater flexibility by
allowing multiple other transactional tokens
to be used and exist independently; in effect
allowing child chains to exist and run on the
same network while operating largely inde-
pendent of each other.

111.1 Ardor: Briefly Explained

The Ardor platform is based on the stable and
reliable codebase of Nxt, which has been run-
ning successfully as a public blockchain since
November 2013. Every existing function of the
Nxt blockchain will be supported by Ardor. In
addition, Ardor has a unique design com-
posed of a single parent chain responsible
for network security and processing, and

multiple child chains responsible for the operational
transactions such as creating assets, voting on polls,
sending messages, etc.

Child chains transactions are reported to the parent
chain using a new process called “bundling”. The bun-
dlers package multiple child chain transactions into a
single ChildChainBlock transaction on the parent
chain. The bundlers pay the transaction fees in Ardor
and receive the transaction fees in the child chain
coin.

The first child chain of the Ardor platform is called
“Ignis”. Ignis will inherit all features found on the Nxt
blockchain. These features will also be available on
other child chains, though restrictions can be placed
by the child chain creators if a certain feature is not
desired. Unlike “side chains” and other blockchain-re-
lated technologies, the Ardor parent chain and child
chains like Ignis are based on the same source code
and share the same security guaranties.

111.2 Solutions Through Ardor

Recall the three problems we explained in section
I.1. The Ardor platform brings the following
solutions to these problems:

Structural

Functional

Blockchain

Bloat Solutions

The Ardor parent chain only stores
transactions which affect the
balances of the forgers (proof of
stake block validators). All other
transactions by child chains are
pruned, leaving only a cryptographic
proof (hash) that proves their previ-
ous existence.

A new node joining the blockchain
will only need to validate the parent
chain transactions, which represent
only a small proportion of all, and
the transactions of each child chain
for the past 24 hours, not the full
transaction history. In addition, a
new node will load a snapshot of the
current blockchain state (account
balances, properties, aliases etc)
from one of the existing nodes.

Individuals or entities which need
the full transaction history for their
own book keeping can still store it by
setting up an archival node which
maintains the full transaction histo-
ry based on various conditions.
These entities will then still be able
to prove that a given transaction,
while no longer stored on the block-
chain, was present there in the past.

Single Token

Dependency Solutions

Users of an Ardor child chain will
only deal with the child chain token
both for transfer of value and trans-
action fee payment.

When assets or currencies are issued
on top of a child chain, users of these
tokens pay transaction fees denomi-
nated in the child chain coin, just as
they would for any other transaction
on the child chain.

Users of child chains may not even
be aware that they are using a block-
chain within the Ardor network
through the API.

BaaS solutions

A business that needs its own block-
chain does not have to maintain its
own network of servers, run forging
and worry about system’s security.

Organizations use proven technolo-
gy with the ability to request
customized features tailored to their
needs installed by the core develop-
ment team itself.

For certain applications, a business
entity managing a child chain may
choose to cover transaction fees for
their users by serving as the transac-
tion bundler to make sure that the
child chain transactions are includ-
ed in the parent chain.

Blockchain

Bloat Solutions

We estimate that this design can
reduce the number of transactions
stored on the blockchain at a ratio of
up to 1:100 without compromising
network security.

In the future, Ardor child chains may
even run on their own subnet where
all nodes except one are disconnect-
ed from the rest of the Ardor plat-
form, thus providing the ability to
componentize the blockchain into
domain specific sub-blockchains
and prevent the need for every
blockchain node to process all
blockchain transactions.

Single Token

Dependency Solutions

A white label solution making inno-
vative blockchain features easily
available for organizations and their
user base.

Tokens do not have to be a fixed
amount and child chain owners can
opt to implement inflation or defla-
tion models, and even more compli-
cated distribution mechanisms.

BaaS solutions

Secure and convenient private
blockchain solutions with direct
support available from the core
development team.

In the future, we will make the child
chain creation process automatic,
allowing every business or user to
launch a child chain on their own.

On each chain transaction fees are
paid in the native token (coin) of that
chain. End users do not need to own
ARDR tokens.

All these features are preserved in Ardor,
and are available on each child chain.

A child chain can optionally be restrict-
ed not to enable some features.

The parent chain supports a limited
subset of features, as it is intended to be
used for consensus establishing only
and not for everyday transactions.

Anew process, "bundling", is used to group
child chain transactions into a parent chain
transaction ("child chain block"), which is
then included in the parent chain.

Any account can play the role of a bundler.
The bundling process also performs the
exchange of fees paid by users in child
chain tokens into ARDR fees accepted by

I11.4 Forging and Child chains

With the Ardor platform, the single block-
chain architecture is replaced by a combina-
tion of one forging chain, on which transac-
tions are denominated in one token (ARDR),
and multiple child chains, each having its
own transactional token.

The forging chain supports a very limited set
of allowed transaction types, such as trans-
fer of ARDR from one account to another,
trading of ARDR to each of the child chain
tokens and back, leasing ARDR balances to
other accounts for the purpose of forging,
and a special type of "ChildChainBlock"
transactions. The forging power of each
account depends on its ARDR balance, in
exactly the same way it depends on the NXT
balance on the Nxt platform, with the entire
consensus model remaining unchanged.

All transactions that change ARDR balances
are recorded on the forging chain, and there-
fore downloading and re-processing the
transactions from the forging chain provides
exactly the same proof-of-stake security as
the Nxt platform. However, all transactions
that only modify child chain token balances,
or any other account holdings (such as assets
or currencies), are not recorded on the forging
chain, but only on their corresponding child
chains. Thus, the removal ("pruning") of
those child chain transactions, after they are
no longer needed, does not affect the block-
chain security, as validity of ARDR account
balances can always be verified in a trustless
manner by each node.

111.5 Transaction Validation

The validity of child chain transactions and
account balances (in native tokens) must also
be ensured by the platform, and this is done
by anchoring them to the forging chain by
means of the above ChildChainBlock transac-
tions. This special transaction type contains,
as an attachment, a list of one or more trans-
actions belonging to a single child chain, i.e.
transactions denominated in that child chain
native token, with their execution affecting
only account balances and holdings on that
chain. In effect, such an attachment rep-
resents a "block" on the child chain, although
no actual forging (block generation) is done
on child chains. Those attachments are linked
to the ChildChainBlock transaction by means
of a cryptographic hash only, thus allowing
the transaction signature verification to be
performed even after the actual content of
the attachment has been pruned after some
time. This is building upon the design and
technology already implemented and in pro-
duction use on the Nxt platform. in the form
of prunable messages and prunable data
(data cloud), together with a network of spe-
cial-purpose archival nodes to store them.

Each node running the Ardor blockchain validates the
transactions from all child chains before they are
pruned. A node downloading the blockchain from
scratch will no longer be required to fully validate
child chain transactions that have already been
pruned as they will only verify their hashes and Child-
ChainBlock transaction signature. However, this does
not lower the overall blockchain security as it can still
verify that the accounts that forged the blocks con-
taining them were eligible to forge at that time, and
therefore those transactions must have been validat-
ed by all up to date nodes while their data was still
available, in order to get included in the currently-win-
ning (best difficulty) blockchain fork.

All transactions from all chains must be processed by
all Ardor nodes and these nodes carry all child chain
transactions for the last 1440 blocks, until their expira-
tion deadline, or phasing finish height, whichever is
longer. Child chain transactions will be pruned com-
pletely on nodes not configured to archive them
longer than this minimum retention period, but those
that do, known as archival nodes, can opt to store one
or more child chains longer or indefinitely.

«Team and Supporters

In addition to forging chain transactions and
blocks, each node needs to store the current
state of all accounts, as represented by bal-
ances in native child chain tokens, asset and
monetary system balances, account proper-
ties, aliases, and all other objects and account
holdings that are created as a result of trans-
actions. Any state that might be needed for
validation of future transactions must be
kept. But once the rolling fork resolution limit
of 720 blocks has passed, older state (i.e. the
values of such balances and holdings) no
longer needs to be kept. Such state is being
removed ("trimmed") even now, however in
the current system a node that downloads the
blockchain from scratch is reprocessing all
past transactions, thus re-creating each past
state and trimming it as it goes along. In the
Ardor platform, those old transactions will
also have been pruned, so re-creating past
state in order to arrive at current state will no
longer be possible. To solve this issue, snap-
shots and snapshot propagation will be
implemented.

Periodically, each node will calculate a snapshot of
the state of all derived objects, and a hash of this
snapshot will be included in the current block by its
forger. All nodes that are up to date and on the same
fork already have exactly the same state, and thus will
be able to verify this hash (and reject the block if inval-
id). A protocol will be defined by which nodes that are
out of date, or downloading the blockchain from
scratch, are able to request the latest snapshot from
up to date nodes, validate it based on its hash being
included in the blockchain, and download it in a
decentralized manner. In this way such nodes will
catch up with the latest system state, bypassing the
need to re-process all old transactions, that are
already pruned.

The snapshot data itself does not need to
propagate through the network when the
snapshot hash is calculated. Each node that is
up to date already has the state of all child
chains, so it can generate such a snapshot for
itself. It must only validate that the hash the
forger calculated for the snapshot indeed
matches its own snapshot.

Fees on child chains are denominated in the
chains native tokens, but the forging chain
block forgers still accept fees in the forging
token (ARDR) only. To convert fees collected
in child chain tokens to ARDR, the role of
"bundlers", or ChildChainBlock creators, has
been introduced. Any account can serve as a
creator of a childchain block, provided it is
willing to accept the fees (in native token)
collected from the transactions in the Child-
ChainBlock, and in exchange pay the required
fee (in ARDR) to the forging chain block forger.
This establishes a market rate for child chain
token to ARDR token.

If the fee in native token offered by a transaction
sender is too low by current market rate, when
converted to ARDR, no one will be willing to
bundle such transaction into a ChildChainBlock,
and the sender must resubmit the transaction
with a higher fee. If a child chain token loses
value completely and no-one is willing to
exchange it to ARDR, transaction processing on
that child chain will naturally stop - unless some-
one interested in keeping it alive is willing to sub-
sidize it, creating ChildChainBlocks and paying
the expected ARDR fees to the forgers, while get-
ting worthless (by free market rate) native
tokens in return.

Child chains compete with each other for inclu-
sion into a block, since at the end the forgers will
still look at the fee/size ratio for each transaction
and will want to maximize their forging profits,
subject to main chain block size and transaction
numbers limits.

I11.6 Comparison between Side Chains and Child Chains

We would like to emphasize that side chains and Ardor child chains are not the same.
The differences are described below:

Structure

Function

Side Chains

Side chains are independent block-
chains that have a kind of "pegging
mechanism", where at least one of the
chains (main chain and side chain) is
"aware" of the other chain and both
tokens are pegged at a set ratio. Side
chains need their own network secu-
rity and block processing.

Transactions executed between the
locks and unlocks of the main chain
tokens don't bloat the main chain.
As the technology of a side chain is
connected to its main chain, it can
be used to build on the develop-
ments of the main chain and intro-
duce new features to the market.

Ardor Child Chains

"Child Chains" of the Ardor platform
are tightly integrated into the main
Ardor parent chain. All transactions
are processed and secured by the
parent chain forgers. This makes
cross-chain transactions possible.
Pruning will be enabled on child
chain transactions in order to
significantly reduce blockchain
bloat by pruning the transactions on
regular basis from the blockchain.

Child chains serve as the transac-
tional chains of the parent-child
architecture, as the parent chain
retains minimal features.

Side Chains

Side chains are responsible for their
own security and could be attacked
if there is not enough mining power
to secure it.

If the main chain is compromised,
the side chain can still operate,
though its peg will likely lose
significant value.

« Realistic Testnet (funds at risk);

« Semi-centralized chain;

+ Pegged chains.

The initial design was published by
Blockstream in 2014, but the implemen-
tation is blocked by the lack of native
support for SPV proofs in Bitcoin (which
may not be added at all). Rootstock
workaround this by sacrificing decen-
tralization (still work in progress).

Ardor Child Chains

Child chains rely on the Ardor parent chain for
their security, as long as the parent chain has
enough forging power all child chains are secure.

* Security is provided by the Ardor parent chain
and therefore all child chain cooperate to secure
the same network;

* Child chains can access the same global entities,
such as assets and currencies;

* Child chain tokens can be securely traded on the
blockchain;

* Simple to setup (blockchain development skills
not required);

+ Multiple features pre-installed (can be disabled
on launch if desired).

+ Pegged chains;

* Simple blockchain as a service solution;
* Semi-private blockchain;

+ Prototyping and research.

lll.7 Pegged Child Chains

The ability of child chain tokens to have their indepen-
dent market value, without this affecting the security of
the whole platform, allows one important use case that
deserves further mention - the creation of Pegged Child
Chains.

Third party businesses can peg the value of their child
chain token to a fiat currency, or to other cryptocurren-
cy, thus allowing all transactions on this child chain to
be effectively denominated in that external currency.
When such pegged child chains are added to the Ardor
Platofrm, users will have the choice of pricing their
asset ask/bid orders in fiat, selling their marketplace
goods with prices in fiat, asset issuers will be able to
pay dividends calculated in fiat, etc. This opens the
door to conducting seemless transactions with fiat
over the blockchain. Furthermore, the existence of
multiple child chains pegged to different external cur-
rencies will allow users to trade them for each other
using the Coin Exchange functionality, effectively using
Ardor as a decentralized foreign exchange ("forex")
platform.

I11.8 Why Do We Need Ignis?

a. A fully decentralized child chain

While the Ardor platform can have multiple child chains
with similar features, only the Ignis child chain will be
created with no restrictions. Other child chain creators
would have the ability to set certain restrictions, for
example disabling the decentralized Marketplace
feature should they prefer to have a centralized market-
place for their business. They may also choose to set
overall goals or other rules that not everyone may agree
with, as well as possibly control the supply or future
distribution of the coins used on their child chain. The
Ardor platform will be capable of supporting permis-
sioned child chains that can impose further restrictions
on their users such as KYC, AML, personal data protec-
tion, time-limited data retention, local securities trad-
ing laws for asset issuers, etc. But the Ignis child chain
will be permissionless, available to the general public,
with no restrictions on who can transact on it.

b. Increased tradability of the token

The interoperability of the Ardor platform and the
organic connection between all child chains which will
exist on the platform will allow the users of Ignis to
have easy access to the other child chains and benefit
from the services they may provide inside the plat-
form. While every child chain uses its own coin, objects
such as assets are global so that assets issued using
the Ignis child chain can still be traded on all other

26

child chains and vice versa. IGNIS can also be traded
for any other child chain coin as well as ARDR using the
Coin Exchange feature.

c. How to access the features of Ignis child chain?

IGNIS is the native operational token of Ignis - the first
child chain of Ardor. In order to access the features of
the Ignis child chain, users will require the IGNIS
tokens. In short, IGNIS is the entry point to Ardor - an
innovative platform built on the solid proven founda-
tion of the Nxt blockchain. IGNIS gives access to the
rich functionality of the platform and the unrestricted
features of the permissionless Ignis child chain, such
as asset exchange, coin exchange, account properties,
messaging, aliases, marketplace, voting, conditional
transactions, composite phasing, etc.

IV. Business Talk

IV.1 Revenue Sources

Jelurida has identified three primary revenue
streams based on the Nxt and Ardor blockchain
protocol. The revenue sources will help Jelurida
to be a self-sustainable project in the medium to
long term.

a. Child Chain Creation and Customization

The unique structure of the Ardor platform will
allow the creation of customized child chains
with their own native tokens. Though each child
chain will come with all features that will be
found on the Ignis child chain, some features can
be disabled and additional ones needed for a
specific child chain can be developed. Even after
the future implementation of user-created child
chains, Jelurida will still be able to provide child
chain creation services, if heavy customization is
required, such as child chain coin inflation or the
ability for the child chain creator to generate
more child chain tokens. Paid maintenance and
support of the child chains will be a part of this
service. Revenue sharing with businesses which
extract revenue from their child chains (such as
pegged to real currencies or BTC child chains) is
another possible income source.

b. Consulting

Jelurida will provide consulting services such as
modification of the existing features or building
custom functionality to fit the needs of each
client. With this service, the changes applied are
done by the creators of the platform itself, so it is
done in an efficient and secure manner. Other
consulting services will also be available, such as
the verification of potential use case applications
with our technology at a high technical level.
Consulting not only for businesses but also for
large range of organisations and public authori-
ties about the potential benefits of integrating
the blockchain technology in their operations.

c. Private Chain Licensing

Both Nxt and Ardor, after it launches in early Q4
2017, will be available for organizations to license
for private chain solutions. Though it is open
source, if changes are made and closed sourced,
a license from Jelurida would be required.
Private chain licensing will help enterprises not
only to have a secure private blockchain solution,
but also to have one directly supported by the
core developers of the technology, all while being

able to keep their changes closed source. Part

like in-wallet ads or charging for promotion of
certain child chain services in the wallet itself;

- Integration of exchanges and payment provid-
ers in the wallet to allow conversion of child
chain coins to other crypto currencies, pegged to
fiat or BTC child chains etc., and revenue sharing
with them.

The financial and banking sectors have undoubtedly been in the last
years some of the most eager industries to embrace the advantages
of the blockchain technology. Cross-border transactions, mirror
accounts, trade finance, money transfer, digitalized payments and
insurance tracking can all benefit from the distributed and trustless
nature of the blockchain. Ardor, being written in Java, scalable and
secure, is the perfect choice not only for the above-mentioned use
cases but also, thanks to its rich functionality, for asset and securi-
ties issuance, management, trading, and dividend payments.

Payment providers, exchanges, and money trans-
mitters can create a pegged to a fiat currency
child chain, can provide asset and currency toke-
nization, allowing their clients to transact easily
on the blockchain in their national currency.

In fact, not only big financial institutions can use
blockchain such as Ardor in their operations. Due
to its scalability and the parent-child architecture
the energy and hardware requirements for using
a child chain are so minimal that practically even
SMEs can digitalize their company’s internal pro-
cesses for transparency, security and efficiency
while the extremely flexible voting feature can be
used to facilitate the shareholders meetings.

Public authorities, on both local and national
level, are also experimenting with integrating
blockchain technology in various sectors like
tracking of government payments, digital identi-
ty management, real estate or IP recording,
notarial services and not in the last place - for
optimizing the highly expensive old-fashioned
and not so secure way of voting. Legal profes-
sionals can use it for time stamping of docu-
ments, proof of existence, secure messaging, dig-
ital signatures etc. For all these use cases a highly
adaptable, flexible and cost-efficient blockchain
architecture is needed in order to satisfy the
diversity and complexity of the tasks ahead.

For example, if KYC or AML procedures are
required or personal data retention or protection
need to be in place, the platform has to be able to
implement that too. The Ardor blockchain is using
various transaction types which can be easily built
upon or modified to address such conditions and
proof of that is the variety of features already
implemente, tested, and proven on the Nxt block-
chain.

Other use cases of the Ardor platform can be logis-
tics, parts tracking, mobile roaming, recording of
system logs events, recording of donations to
non-profit organizations, traditional crowdfund-
ing, financial return based crowdfunding etc.

Speaking more generally, every time when people
or organizations need to do business together but
they do not trust each other, every time when a
system without single point of failure has to be
used or immutable ledger is needed, there is a
room for blockchain technology and the Ardor
platform fits such needs perfectly.

V. Crowdsale details

IGNIS and ARDR will be allocated to user accounts
in the Ardor genesis block. Their distribution will
be based on a one-time snapshot conducted over
the Nxt blockchain, the "Ardor Genesis Snapshot",
to be performed at least two weeks after the end of
the last round of the IGNIS crowdsale and shortly
before the Ardor launch.

V.1 IGNIS distribution

The total amount of IGNIS coins issued will be
equal to half of the amount of NXT coins existing
on the Nxt blockchain at the time of the Ardor
Genesis Snapshot, plus 500 M (five hundred mil-
lion). As already promised, approximately half of
the IGNIS coins will be reserved and distributed
automatically to the NXT holders based on their
account balances at the time of the Ardor Genesis
Snapshot, at a ratio of 1 NXT: 0.5 IGNIS.

From the remaining 500 M (five hundred million)
IGNIS, 440 M (four hundred and forty million) will
be offered to the general public in the IGNIS
crowdsale (conducted using JLRDA tokens at ‘I
Owe You’ basis ), and 60 M (sixty million) will be
kept by Jelurida. The funds raised during the
IGNIS crowdsale will be used for the further
development, maintenance, advancement, and
world-wide promotion of the Nxt and Ardor
blockchain platforms, as well as protecting the
intellectual property of the code base.

V.2. Crowdsale infrastructure

The token sale itself will be conducted on the Nxt
blockchain platform. A "controllable currency"
called JLRDA will be issued and offered for sale in
several consecutive rounds. The price of the
JLRDA tokens will be denominated in NXT and
will increase at each round, with full details in the
table below. Each round will last for one week
and there will be at least a one-week break
between subsequent rounds.

*JLRDA tokens give the right to receive IGNIS tokens at the time of the Ardor launch. JLRDA tokens are not transferable or tradable
between accounts and for 1 JLRDA, the crowdsale participant will receive 1 IGNIS at the time of Ardor Genesis Snapshot.

For 1 JLRDA token the participants in the IGNIS crowd-
sale will receive 1 IGNIS coin at the time of the Ardor

The last batch of 100 M JLRDA tokens will be reduced
by up to 20 M tokens allocated by Jelurida for promo-
tional and marketing use. Jelurida will keep as NXT
20% (but not more than 40 M NXT) of the NXT coins
collected in the crowdsale. Jelurida will convert the
rest of the collected NXT to fiat or BTC, but reserves
the right to do so in portions, or at a later time
depending on market conditions.

In case any batch is sold out before the end of the des-
ignated time frame, the next round will still start as
scheduled. If any batch is not sold completely at the
end of the designated time frame, the remaining
unsold JLRDA tokens will be added to the next batch.
If not all of the JLRDA tokens are sold by the end of the
last batch, Jelurida reserves the right to decide what
to do with the unsold amount depending on the out-
come of the crowdsale.

Note: Due to the high market volatility, Jelurida
reserves the right to postpone or modify the schedule
of the ICO if the market conditions change significantly.

Bitswift wants to ensure the security and longevity of their tokens. By migrating them
to a secure blockchain infrastructure such as Ardor, the Bitswift team can focus on
utility applications for the Bitswift tokens rather than on blockchain infrastructure
dealings which is a beast of its own. Through migrating to the Ardor platform we
inherit a wealth of options for our tokens, most notably a fully featured API from
which we can build out applications to provide extended utility for our tokens.

Paul Busch, Founder of Bitswift (Future Child Chain on Ardor)

Janus tokens are moving to the Ardor platform as we consider it a natural evolution
of the project. Increased focus on business with the Ardor Blockchain aligns with our
company goals of building a multi-industry business empire.

The Janus Project Team (Future Asset on Ardor)

The nice part of Ardor is that it is creating something completely new again and fixes
issues that most blockchains have, like blockchain-bloat. A motherchain with multi-
ple child chains. Forging with Ardor for many blockchains is brilliant and could gain
much attention and brings mining to a new level.

The unique design introduced by the core developers will make it easier for a lot of business and consumers to
interact with the blockchain. Knowing that there is a development team working for more than two years on the
concept | am passionate about, | really want to see what the Ardor network can host.

Ruben Bueno Castro, Writer at Nxter Magazine, Community Member since May 2014

Ardor's (child) chains improve scaling even further, by making most transactions prunable. It will allow for cheap
transactions without compromising security, so that many new exciting applications will become economically
viable.

Brangdon, Community Member since April 2014

Ardor is ahead of the times. | think in the long term it will be important not only to prevent blockchain bloat, but
also to offer a simple way creating new blockchains while its users should not worry with the technical difficul-
ties. With the Ardor platform it now becomes possible for basically every business to set up its own blockchain
without having to worry about security issues. This altogether is quite exciting | think.

Neomadra, Community Member since March 2014

Simply put, the Nxt developers know what there are doing and they always deliver on their promises. I've
followed the team since the early beginning of Nxt’s existence and the project has advanced the abilities of
secured decentralized applications tremendously. Nxt is also a green blockchain technology and | like this. I'm
totally staggered. The Ardor platform is the natural expansion of Nxt where blockchain scalability is addressed.
Contrary to the Bitcoin scaling solution currently on the table, Ardor's solution improves the global decentraliza-
tion of the network instead of reducing it. The ideas of multiple fully featured child chains is also extremely wel-
comed as this increases the synergy around the Ardor platform. Sincerely, you got to take a deep look at this seri-
ous and impressive project!

Ardor is taking NXT to the next level. Based on more than three years of experience with NXT, the core team
showed successfully all its genius by developing new concepts that overcome present shortcomings of classic
cryptocoins. Handling blockchain bloat, scaling, shorter transaction times, implementing smart transactions
(without neglecting security issues), and separation of forging tokens from transactional tokens come to my
mind.

eu58 Community Member since Q1 2014

The solved blockchain-bloat problem is a really big thing, not only for NXT/Ardor but also for crypto as a whole. |
am sure that will lead Ardor to a top position in the BaaS branch.

Logan, Community Member since Q1 2014

lam excited because | believe it solves a simple, but hard problem: scaling and onboarding. Just this month, it
turned out a lot of value was at risk due to a problem with one smart contract in Parity. Ardor should allow such
initiatives to enter crypto with less risk.

Bas Wisselink, Nxt Foundation Founder and Advisor, Community Member since December
2013

| love that the tech has been working without a hitch since the beginning. That track record is unusually good.
But the great community of Nxt is really above all else what kept me around. The altcoin space in general is very
toxic and full of spammers (see BitcoinTalk). | imagine that got especially developer-types attracted, that then
spawned a lot of good projects off- and around Nxt. The use case for the child currencies is so perfect for busi-
nesses and community projects: They can use the infrastructure of Ardor without users having to get the Ardor
currency.

After almost four years, | still don't know any active cryptocurrency platform that can beat Nxt in versatility and
accessibility. It can do many things, in a simple way, using a great API, and it works. The Nxt community has been
also exceptional as think tank and nursery for many cool projects in crypto. A great place to be these years. Ardor
is literally a new dimension in the ecosystem. And Nxt is a terrific blueprint for custom blockchains

Joan Manel Vilaseca, Nxt Foundation Partner, Community Member since December 2013

NXT was, is, and will remain, the ultimate blockchain. But as every blockchain, it is limited by blockchain size,
which means, in term of long term business planing, despite all you can hear around the blockchains these days,
due to transactions competition, only business dealing with very high value transactions (or very rare) are safe
to organize activities around blockchains. The lower, the value of the transactions, the shorter, the duration
where any activity can survive with the use of blockchains (unless it plans for a decrease of usage frequency).
With childchain pruning, Ardor is the NXT answer to this limit, it widen the scope of usability, because it largely
increases the time any business can consider to be able to benefit from the blockchains. In short, Ardor is a cru-
cial step toward mainstream blockchain adoption. It is the step of the dream team that already deployed the
ultimate blockchain which is running without a single record of incident for nearly 4 years!

Abstract

Digix provides a use case for the tokenisation and documentation of physical assets through its
Proof of Asset (PoA) protocol. The PoA protocol utilises Ethereum’ and the InterPlanetary
Files System (IPFS)? to track an asset through its chain of custody. This allows for the open and
public verification of an asset’s existence without a centralised database. Digix also offers an
API allowing other applications to be built on top of our asset tokenisation service.

Key Products

1.

Proof of Asset (PoA) Asset Cards

PoA Asset Cards consist of the below information permanently uploaded onto the
decentralised database:

Time Stamp of card creation

SKU of the gold bar

Bar Serial number

Chain of Custody digital signatures (Vendor, Custodian, Auditor)
Purchase Receipt

Audit Documentation

Depository Receipt

Storage fees due

PoA Asset Cards are kept in an Ethereum Wallet.

Digix Tokens (DGX)

Dgx Tokens are minted via a Minter Smart Contract. Each DGX token represents 1g of
Gold and divisible to 0.001g. For every PoA Card that is sent to the Minter Smart
Contract, DGX tokens will be issued in return. For instance, a 100g PoA Card sent to the
Minter Smart Contract returns 100 DGX tokens to the user.

Digix Tokens are held in an Ethereum Wallet.

Key Processes

There are 3 modular processes that Digix uses to provide a proof of existence and fungibility for
an asset, 1 for redemption of physical assets, and 1 that encourages Dapp Development. Those
processes consist of:

1.

Proof of Asset (PoA) Verification process which records and provides an audit trail of
an asset on Ethereum to create PoA Asset Cards. The asset cards are certified using
sequential digital signatures from the entities in the chain of custody, namely, the
Vendor, Custodian, Auditor, which are further validated with proof of purchase and
depository receipts provided and uploaded onto IPFS for permanent record (Fig i).

The PoA Verification contains a sub process for regular audits as shown in (Fig ii).

Digix’s Proof of Asset Participants
(Blockchain Oracle Entities)

Asset Vendor

ValueMax Singapore, a publicly listed company, supplies London Bullion Market Association
(LBMA3) certified gold bullion bars through the Digix Marketplace. Established in 1988, they
provide pawnbroking services, retail and trading of pre-owned jewellery, gold and luxury
timepieces.

Independent Auditor

Bureau Veritas Inspectorate will carry out quarterly checks on the quality and quantity at our
custodian vault to ensure accounting is upheld. They are a multinational group with capabilities
in an extensive range of commodities, providing independent inspection, sampling and testing
services of precious metals.

Every gold bullion is rigorously tested with precision instruments at Audit. We perform such
measurements using Ultrasonic Gauge Measurements (UTM) and densometers. UTM is a
method of performing non-destructive measurement (gauging) of the local thickness of a solid
element basing on the time taken by the ultrasound wave to return to the surface. Densometers
are devices that measure the density of objects with water displacement.

Participating Custodian Vault

Malca-Amit’s state of the art facility near Singapore Changi International Airport is located in the
Le Freeport of Singapore, a 25,000 sqm high-security and climate-controlled facility featuring
cutting edge security technologies enhanced by green building engineering.

Multi-party Trust Mechanism

The Digix system relies on multiple independent participants to provide a transparent platform
for the tokenization of physical assets. We can assume that miners in a Proof of Work based
crypto-currency system will act rationally, that is, that they would act in a way to maximize and
protect their long term profits by performing their role of transaction verification. We assume that
a cartel of rational miners would not collude to perform double spending attacks as such attacks
would cause reputational damage to the entire system. We must therefore assume that in the
Digix system which is the tri-party system consisting of asset providing vendors, the asset
custodian in charge of storing and securing the asset from theft, and the auditor in charge of

ensuring the authenticity of the reported assets in custody are all acting in a rational manner
who are trying to maximize their profits from the fees that they collect for their service.

Mitigating Potential Points of Failure with Real World Governance
Dishonest Entities and collusion in the chain of custody

Digix works with entities in jurisdictions that provide stringent regulatory oversight and corporate
governance. The entities we have engaged with are either publicly listed or well known in the
industry for providing their niche service. Each entity that we have engaged with performs a
separate function to prevent cheating. For instance, the asset vendor for physical assets cannot
also be the asset custodian. The interest in the service has to be independent of one another.
While the risk of collusion is a real possibility, it is at the cost of severe reputational and legal
damages to the colluding participants. As these entities provide similar other services to other
customers and such reputational and legal damages to their core business would be detrimental
to their business, we can make a fair assumption that they will act in a rational manner.

Key Benefits
No centralised database management of Crypto Asset records
All chain of custody information is fully managed by the Ethereum blockchain. This blockchain
ledger is immutable with data upload taking significantly less time than on the Bitcoin
blockchain.*
No Web-based log-in
There is no web form log-in. Users will download desktop clients from Digix. The application
itself can also be compiled from source on Github and is publicly auditable.° There is
significantly less chance of a Man in the Middle attack compared to traditional user web-based
log-in.®

Secure Cold Storage of Crypto-Assets

Digix’s Aegis Vaults is a cold storage wallet custodial service for crypto-assets and crypto
currencies on Ethereum.

All asset data is recorded on the blockchain and exists indefinitely. Even if Digix folds, every
proof generated can be verified and are admissible in a court of law in the applicable
jurisdiction.

Ex post facto Incentivization Mechanism

The Proof of Asset process requires that regular quarterly or more frequent audits to be
performed by a 3rd party auditor on the entire collection of gold assets held at the custodian
vaults. The auditor performs a complete audit of each gold bar which includes verification of its
authenticity, weight, and physical examination to detect anomalies or defects. The auditor
submits a record on the Gold Registry contract for each and every single bar that has been
audited, which contains an IPFS reference to a signed paper documentation, the auditor’s
Ethereum identity, and a pass or fail result.

Digix receives its revenues through the collection of transaction fees paid in the form of Digix
gold tokens. These tokens are held in an escrow contract which can only release the tokens to a
specified address after the successful completion of a 3rd party audit.

Generic I/O Contracts and Dapp Development Opportunities
The generic I/O contract provided at Digix allows developers to utilize PoA Asset Cards or Digix
tokens for Dapp development and event logging. Our vision is to create an ecosystem for
developers to utilize DGX tokens as a framework for various Dapp developments. Code
samples will be provided on our Github.

Wealth Inheritance

Dead man’s switch can be built as a service to allow wealth to be passed on in the form of
Crypto Assets to the mentioned Ethereum address under the Digix system.

Gamification

In legal jurisdictions, DGX tokens can be used like bitcoin to facilitate in game currency or as
gaming tokens.® The PoA protocol can also be used for the issuance of digital gaming assets.”

Escrow

DGxX tokens can provide a better and less volatile store of value for Escrow services on the
blockchain.

Crowdfunding

A Dapp can provide crowdfunding opportunities with crypto-currencies and crypto-assets, or
offer convertibility of cryptocurrencies to DGX tokens as a hedge to price volatility.

Gold Backed Crypto Currency Developments

Cryptocurrencies can stake a portion of its value with DGX Gold tokens and Gold Assets,
backing its value with Gold.

Crypto Exchanges and Wealth Management Dapps

When exchanges integrate DGX tokens as a cryptocurrency pair, they will be able to offer a
gold hedge to cryptocurrencies as part of their service offering. Wealth management services
that adjusts your cryptocurrency / crypto asset holdings can be developed to manage an
individual’s crypto financial risk profile.

P2P Lending and Microfinance

Dapps can utilize DGX Gold for peer to peer lending. A borrower can call for funding through a
Dapp based on his risk profile and reputation and negotiate a rate of return on the borrowed
funds. Interest / yield payments can be serviced at regular intervals with a penalty system in
place for late payments. This has already been done with bitcoin®, but due to the price volatility
of cryptocurrencies, lenders may lose more of their asset value than what can be earned from
the interest during the period of the loan. The price stability of DGX Gold Tokens can facilitate
the adoption rate of such services.

Collateral services
Privately held assets can be safely and efficiently used as collateral without going through
lengthy verification process to ascertain an asset’s existence and authenticity.
Conclusion
Digix will provide a transparent, audit friendly, safe protocol that leverages the full potential of

Ethereum's decentralized consensus ecosystem and IPFS to facilitate crypto assets on the
blockchain.

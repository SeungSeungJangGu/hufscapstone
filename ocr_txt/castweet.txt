1. Abstract

Nowadays, the growth of the multi-broadcasting or livestreaming market has
moved beyond what anyone could have previously anticipated a few years ago. As the
rate of cord-cutting, or the choice of most users to cancel their cable TV subscription,
has continued to expand, more and more users are opting to only subscribe and use

livestreaming as their main source of entertainment.

In addition to this, the possession of smartphones has become the norm for people
of all ages. It has become the norm instead of the exception to see children as young
as elementary school with their own smartphone that they use for entertainment
and to view on-demand content from Youtube, Netflix, and Twitch. As our portable
devices take a greater percentage of our leisure time, live-streaming as the de-facto

choice for entertainment will continue to expand.

Beyond just entertainment, e-commerce is making the transition into the live-
streaming as well. Consumers, always weary of the over-commercialization and
increasingly lack of trust with corporations, are looking more to trusted sources to
purchase their items. The live-streaming e-commerce market has been undergoing
incredible growth within Asian markets and is primed to expand globally. Live-
streamed e-commerce allows anyone from farmers to professional makeup artists
to exhibit products and engage directly with their potential customers, creating a

greater trust in the products themselves.

However, at the heart of this issue, is how to equitably share the revenue generated
from these different platforms. In the current environment, most of the revenue is
concentrated within the platform itself and the content creators who provide the
viewing options to consumers. However, this unequal share of revenue has left the

viewers, who actually generate the revenue by viewing ads, purchasing in-app items,
A Multi-broadcast Platform based on Blockchain Incentives for Everyone * CASTWEET

and subscribing to their favorite channels wholly uncompensated for their actions.

In order to address this, Castweet is creating a revenue model with blockchain-
based incentives that shares a portion of the revenue with the viewers themselves.
Our goal is to create a platform that viewers prefer over other live-streaming
competitors as their participation is both compensated and motivated. With this
viewer-centric approach, viewers are motivated to not only view, but also engage,
share, and shape the development of the platform. Our goal is to create a system of “if
you build it, they will come," where the large viewer base actively motivates content

creators to participate and engage on the platform.

At the same time, the revenue model provides creators with a comparable revenue
split to traditional platforms in order to motivate adoption and create the streams
for the viewers to join. By rewarding the viewers with points in which to support
their favored content creators, content creators can generate more overall revenue
without requiring their viewers to directly pay with their own money. Besides just
providing a platform for entertainment, Castweet aims to support the new class of
internet entrepreneurs who use live-streaming for e-commerce to promote and sell

products directly to consumers.

Overall, the Castweet project supports and compensates the following groups :

- Viewers who are currently uncompensated for their views while creating the actual
revenue for the platform.

- Content creators who generate content for the viewers to join but have a difficulty
in monetizing their content effectively across different platforms.

- Live-streaming sellers who are looking for a platform to promote and sell their
products with an in-platform payment system and access to stock from established
brands.

- Advertisers and established brands who want to reach users within different
A Multi-broadcast Platform based on Blockchain Incentives for Everyone * CASTWEET

demographics and interests across genre types or provide stock to allow internet

entrepreneurs to do the selling for the brand.

By developing a decentralized solution that uses blockchain-based incentives to
both users and content creators, we believe that our platform can allow a more fair
and circulated distribution of rewards while also creating a new model that values the

contributions provided by the viewers.

2. Live—Streaming Market

2.1. Project Target (overview)

Our current viewing habits are in an ever-changing dynamic. Users are spending a
majority of their leisure time engaging with the content they love across the various
genres, whether it be gaming, lifestyle, food, or beauty content. The ability for any
viewer to find a broadcast related to whatever niche they happen to be interested in
is taken for granted by the billions of monthly viewers. When in the past they had to
wait for their desired program to be broadcast, now they can instantly connect to a

live-stream or view a VOD their preferred live-streamers database.

With these changes, comes a need to rethink the model of compensation that we
use to reward both viewers and content creators. The current markets largely ignore
the viewers themselves, mainly focusing on compensating content creators and
using the power of their contents to drive the users to the platform itself. However,
by reimagining and upending this content creator model, viewers can be motivated
to use a platform and then bring in more and more content creators. By using a
viewer-centric model, many of the problems with platform growth can be addressed

and lead to a favorable and engaging cycle.

In addition, adding blockchain-based incentives can provide the clarity and
transparency that many users would like to see. As each transaction is recorded into
the blockchain, users can clearly see how their rewards are being dispensed and can

create a greater trust in the platform itself.

<Figure 1: Castweet Target Groups>

The target groups of the Castweet model can be thought of in this way :

Addressing the issues of these different groups is vital to creating a thriving and
active live-streaming platform that both promote content creators and viewers to
engage on the platform. Looking at each group's needs and understanding their

motivations for participation are essential for the health of the platform.

Professional Content Creators are any creators that come from the traditional
media industry, whether they are a celebrity, news, company or any type of
content you would consider to be of the highest level and quality. These groups are
constantly looking for more ways to engage with their fandoms and provide their
content and information to the largest amount of viewers. By addressing their needs
and promoting viewers to spend more time engaging and sharing the content, their

needs can be met.

The Streamer/Influencer group is the popular content creators broadcasting on

the established platforms such as Twitch or Youtube. This group can have anywhere
A Multi-broadcast Platform based on Blockchain Incentives for Everyone * CASTWEET

from tens of thousands to millions of followers and subscribers that engage with
their created contents and streams. While many groups are already providing
platforms for them to upload and share their content, they could benefit from more
income directly from the viewers themselves. By providing viewers with a means
to compensate content creators without directly investing their own funds, the
streamer/influencer group can improve their overall compensation. Also included
within this group are internet entrepreneurs looking to sell their own products

directly via live-stream. This group can be supported by providing an in-platform

payment system and ability to promote their own streams to maximize their reach.

The Indie or Amateur streamer group is any streamer who currently broadcasts
but hasn't quite hit the critical mass to be full-time without another source of
income. This group desperately would like to increase their viewer count and seeks
more additional revenue sources to allow them to become a full-time streamer. By
increasing discoverability and providing automatic monetization, this group can be

supported further on the Castweet Platform.

Finally, the viewer groups are completely uncompensated across the various
available platforms. By providing blockchain-based incentives to this group,
which is our primary target, we believe that we can further their engagement and
consumption habits within the platform. Additionally, giving them with a free way to
support their preferred content creators motivates further participation within the

platform.

2.2. Live—stream Market Status

These days, the number of multi-broadcast users is continuing to expand at rapid
pace. According to Statistica, Youtube is generating more than $116 billion dollars
in advertising revenue per year within the platform. However, the viewers that are
helping support this revenue-generating machine are wholly uncompensated for

their value provided on that platform.

<Figure 2: : Youtube Advertising Revenue>

In addition, the imbalance between viewers and creators can readily be seen by looking
at the number of creators channels vs. viewers. On Youtube alone, only 1% of channels
will ever upload a video and have the ability to earn from their uploaded contents. This
shows that the other 99% of the people engaging on the platform, the viewers, are
actually generating the value for the platform itself. Also, the Adsense revenue is split
with 55% of the advertising revenue going to the creator and 45% taken by the Youtube
platform itself. This ratio also ignores the viewers with the platform taking much more

revenue than is actually required to maintain the platform itself.

Focusing on the live-streaming market directly, the platform Twitch.tv, which
is the largest streaming platform with a major focus on gaming content, has
an overwhelming number of active streamers. Partners, or high-tier streamers,
had reached over 27,000 by the end of 2017 and their second-tier of monetized
streamers, Affiliates, is now more than 150,000 monthly streamers. These streamers
often spend long hours each day providing contents in a never-ending cycle of
streaming. Due to the need to constantly be streaming and innovating on their
content, the amount of hours these streamers spend daily is often more than the

average 40 hour work week seen in traditional jobs.

In addition to the ever-increasing number of live-streamers active within the
platforms, the influence of mega-streamers can also have a profound impact on
alternative streaming options. Previously the top streamer on the Twitch platform
with 14 million followers, Ninja announced his move in early August 2019 to Mixer, a
live-streaming platform owned by Microsoft, and was able reach more than 1 million
subscribers within only one week. Similarly, PewDiePie, the top individual creator
channel on Youtube, moved his live-streaming exclusively over to DLive due a more
favorable compensation model and caused the platform to experience 67% monthly
user growth within only one month of joining the platform. These two cases of top
end creators show that current streamers are dissatisfied with the current offerings

and are flexible on moving to a new platform if the environment is right.

<Figure 5: Large-streamers Effect on Alternative Platforms>

On top of providing viewers with entertainment, live-streaming is rapidly becoming
a source for long-established brands, new startups, and entrepreneurs to engage
directly with consumers in order to sell products. In 2018, the Chinese platform
Taobao Live reported sales of over $14.93 billion dollars in 2018, and was growing
at a rate of 400% annually. During these live-streams, the streamer can show off
goods and talk directly with the chat to sell their products, creating a greater amount
of trust between the buyer and seller. This direct contact with consumers built upon

the previous success of traditional broadcast sales, such as QVC in the United States,

11
A Multi-broadcast Platform based on Blockchain Incentives for Everyone * CASTWEET

while providing the benefits of the latest technology. As more and more consumers
have started to distrust overly commercial connections, a direct sales line to

consumers will continue to become more important for all products and industries.

The popularity of live-streaming is spread throughout the globe with each target
market having their own preferences for viewing and posting contents. Within Korea,
a survey of thousands of Korean elementary school students showed that Youtuber
had become the top 5 job most desired by current students for the first time.
Interestingly, this new addition to the top 10 had removed scientist from the top
jobs for the first time since this national survey was started. This shows that the jobs
of the future are in a shift, where content creator is becoming a more central and
desirable job for the upcoming generation. As this shift continues to further move
towards content creators, the live-streaming market will become more competitive
and compensation models and alternative choices outside of the top existing

platforms will be more in demand.

2.3. Issues of the Live—streaming Market

The current status of the live-streaming market has issues facing each section of
the market structure. Beyond the fact that viewers are not compensated for their
activity and time spent on the platform, there are two main divisions that have
inherent limitations for the live-streaming industry as a whole. The live-streaming
platforms themselves have issues that are preventing further engagement and
growth of the platform as well as issues faced by the content creators who are left
dissatisfied with their existing choices, By addressing both of these problems in one
platform, Castweet can offer up solutions that improve upon the issues of streaming

platforms and help solve problems found by the content creators.
2.3.1. Issues of Streaming Platforms

While the top platforms for streaming, Youtube and Twitch, have a large majority
of the active streamers, the streaming platforms themselves are not without issues
that affect satisfaction and performance. Some of the main issues seen on these

platforms can be seen below :

Users gain no tangible reward for Viewing & Engaging

Live-streaming platforms have become a medium for commercial advertisements,
a place for communication, entertainment, and sharing of information. Consequently,
there has been a rise in consumer dissatisfaction as well as damages occurred from
the use of these platforms. According to the Korea Consumer Agency, out of 500
consumers, 63.8% have answered "experienced dissatisfaction" from the use of live-
streaming platforms and 82.4% of such dissatisfaction was caused by "excessive
amount of commercial posts."

Further, as seen in the above charts, a case in which a platform provider returning

massive profits generated through marketing back to its users is extremely rare. A
A Multi-broadcast Platform based on Blockchain Incentives for Everyone * CASTWEET

monopoly on profits by platform providers is also a prevalent problem in the live-
streaming market. Due to an increase in advertisement exposure frequency, platform
provider's profit increases. However, ironically, the user's usage environment is

becoming increasingly worse.

Centralized Systems and a Lack of Transparent Data Usage

With Facebook's user information leakage incident which lead to the EU to bring
GDPR into effect, social media's information leakage is done opposed to a user
agreement and beyond agreed limits. Platform providers monopolize user's personal
information and monetize it in order to make profits through advertisements and
selling of user data. In that process, transparency is inhibited, questioning the
platform provider's ethical and legal responsibility. This is a problem caused when
centralized services undertakes excessive business activities and allow individual's
private information to be shared with companies, regardless of the actual wishes or

preference of the users themselves.

Discoverability
Current platforms are incentivized to promote only the top performing streamers

on their homepage by their current revenue model. Since large streamers have
been proven to be successful at driving engagement, the organization of promoted
content on all streaming platforms favors only the largest 1% of streamers while
ignoring the other 99% of streamers who could possibly be creating equally as
engaging content. This misconception that only proven live-streams should be
promoted as left dissatisfaction felt by the streamers who are trying to move from a

part-time to full-time streamer and has limited their livelinoods greatly.

In addition, the new class of internet entrepreneurs using live-streaming for sales
find it difficult to attract attention to their live-streams. This directly affects their

ability to sell and ultimately can “make or break” the success of their business. By

14
A Multi-broadcast Platform based on Blockchain Incentives for Everyone * CASTWEET

allowing them to promote their own streams and invest directly into the reach of

their business, they can improve access to consumers.

Copyright Infringement

Since anyone can simply upload content onto a platform and claim it as their
original content, many issues have arisen on the most popular streaming sites
related to unlawful use of copyrighted material. Beyond the expected reposting
of popular media from traditional broadcast outlets, many users upload content
created by other smaller content creators and try to pass that content off as their
own creations. The expansion of “freebooting,” or repurposing the content that
another creator has created as your own, has caused a loss of revenue for original
creators and further incentivized this growing phenomenon. As some famous
freebooting channels have gained millions of followers without creating any original
content, the original creators are left without any share of the earnings, effectively
lowering their motivation for further creations and lowering the quality and variety of

entertainment options for viewers.

2.3.2. Issues of Live-streaming Content Creators

Beyond problems with the platform themselves, many content creators are highly
dissatisfied with the current choices and ability to perform well on the existing
platforms. By using their primary concerns as a basis for the streaming platform,
the Castweet platform will provide more incentives and better motivations for these
streamers to use our platform.

Many streamers in the amateur or indie tier levels feel the current platforms do not
help support their ability to grow. As mentioned, most platforms feature on the top
streamers on the main page and completely ignore streamers at any of the lower
levels, regardless of the quality of the content that they are producing. This creates

a negative feedback loop, where producing more content has been no incentive and

15
A Multi-broadcast Platform based on Blockchain Incentives for Everyone * CASTWEET

further lowers the amount of streams available to users. Especially, streamers in the
amateur tier often find it difficult to market their own stream within platform, relying
only on networking with more famous streamers or using aggressive social media

campaigns to try and build up their following.

=
Twitch gets transparent about how it wants to
boost discovery

EWwiECA

<Figure 7: Twitch Discoverability Issue>

Similarly, the need to constantly follow the newest trends or most popular
streaming categories has lowered the overall quality of available streams. As one
game or social phenomenon becomes popular, streamers of all levels are incentivized
to move over to that genre or game. This forces streamers to constantly innovate
their content while trying to adjust to the newest fads. At the same time, the
streamers themselves can do nothing to promote their stream within that new fad,
and lower-level streamers are unable to reach the front page and viewers have no
motivation to seek out those streams with a lower number of followers. Without
an incentive structure that promotes viewers to search for new and entertaining
streams, the growth of an individual stream is left solely on luck and their own

marketing skills.

This issue is especially severe in those streamers who are within the indie creator

16
A Multi-broadcast Platform based on Blockchain Incentives for Everyone * CASTWEET

community that do not generate enough revenue to change their live-streaming
from an additional revenue stream to their main occupation. While many inventive
and passionate creators have a motivation to create high quality content, the
incentive structure favors the lowest common denominator and punishes any
unique or original content that is outside the norm. By providing new models and
incentivizing a variety of content, some of these issues hurting streamers as a whole

can be addressed.

2.4. Castweet's Solutions for Creating Coin Utility

Even among cryptocurrency enthusiasts, most people view cryptocurrency as more
of a speculative investment product rather than as a means of exchange. Because of
this, 2018 became both the birth and death of utility tokens, cryptocurrencies that
promised to provide viable working products in which the coins themselves had both
a monetary value and use case within a platform. However, the majority of utility coin
ICOs was merely a whitepaper and a dream idea and spent most of their financial
backing on marketing a platform that never came to fruition. This caused even most
of their ardent supporters to move onto security tokens or to keep their investments

within the top 100 coins by market cap.

So what caused this failure and how can we move beyond it to increase the
actual adoption and usage of cryptocurrencies? For cryptocurrency and blockchain
technology to reach every day users, a blockchain-powered platform needs 3 main
characteristics: familiarity to an average person, ability to earn tokens, and a valuable
use case. Castweet meets all 3 of these requirements through providing a live-

streaming platform that can drive engagement.

Addressing issue one, what is more familiar around the world than broadcasting

platforms? Youtube boasts more than 1.5 billion monthly active viewers. Many

<

iewers spend more than 4 hours a day watching their favorite streams, engaging
with the live-streamer, and sharing the contents that they enjoy. When you are
spending a large portion of your waking hours on a platform, familiarity is to be

expected. In this way, the easiest way to reach the average person is to adopt

blockchain and cryptocurrency into a live-streaming platform, creating an easy
method to onboard new users. While cryptocurrency enthusiasts can get interested
in the TPS of a coin, the average person has no interest about the technological

superiority of one over another.
A Multi-broadcast Platform based on Blockchain Incentives for Everyone * CASTWEET

For Castweet, we provide a seamless live-streaming experience that a user of
any of the current offerings would be familiar. From the UI to basic functionality, an
average user can use Castweet and participate as if they had been on the platform
for years. Using the established familiarity and adding in cryptocurrency will allow
average users to get their first taste of the technology and holdings, without having

to go through the daunting task of purchasing off of an exchange.

Concerning issue number 2, there is a growing dissatisfaction among content
creators with the current compensation models across broadcasting platforms. As it
stands, monetization is not readily and directly available to most content creators on
their broadcasting platform of choice. Youtube users are forced to take more brand
deals, some content creators have flocked to Patreon to earn from their creations,
and, even though Youtube creators can monetize their content, the lion's share of

advertising revenue goes to the company.

Castweet's means of solving this issue is to allow all actions, from viewing to
sharing, to have a tangible benefit to the user. Each received CTB points can be
directly converted into CTT tokens with none of the proceeds being taken by the
platform itself. Average users, indie creators, and professional live-streamers can
benefit through our direct compensation model that inspires and rewards great
content uploaded on the platform. We hope to reimagine what it means to participate
on a live-broadcasting platform, turning on its head the notion that content itself
does not have a monetary value and helping to empower visual creators and viewers
of all kinds.

Finally, issue three resides at the heart of what utility tokens set out to do in the
first place: how do you provide utility and a use case for those tokens? The company
must create value through the platform itself, using their tokens as a means of both

exchange for goods or services and as a reward to those that are actively using the

19
A Multi-broadcast Platform based on Blockchain Incentives for Everyone * CASTWEET

coins. You can see this dichotomy established in “investment coins” which have high
purchase rates but low use rates due to future price speculation. For utility coins,
a vibrant ecosystem which promotes the usage of the coins on platform has to be

provided in order to ensure their value.

Within the Castweet platform, the ecosystem was created from the ground up to
promote the usage of the tokens. Tokens can be used within the platform for digital
purchases, our innovative P2P marketing system, tipping creators, or one of the
various other functions in our pipeline. While cryptocurrency traditionalists might be
motivated to hold tokens for future potential gains, average live-stream viewers can
see them as redeemable and directly usable. In this way, the utility of CTT is realized.

The main goal for the platform: blockchain in the back, live-streaming platform in

the front.

3. Ecosystem Summary

The Castweet ecosystem combines live-streamed contents sharing with
blockchain technology, thus creating an ecosystem that rewards everyone. Not only
will streamers be rewarded, but also the users who participate on the platform.
Additionally, the Castweet project provides real use cases based on the actual
behavior of current live-stream viewers and creators in order to incentivize the use
of the tokens within the platform. By combining the platform use cases itself, with
traditional revenue streams in fiat or cryptocurrency from advertisers, the Castweet
project can both improve the value of the CTT token while gaining fiat to help fund
the project. In this way, a healthy ecosystem can be created that prevent the issue of

coin drain and provides sufficient revenue stream for the platform to be maintained.

3.1. Main Target — Users

As our main focus is adding compensation to live-stream viewers, a look at what
motivates users to participate and drives their engagement on a platform is essential.
Participants on live-streaming platform can be divided into four main groups based
on their level of activity and participation within a platform: Spectators, Engaged

Viewers, Highly-active users, and the Content Creators.

These users only watch videos
and do not do any further
engagement on platforms. Most
live-stream viewers fall into this
category.

These users participate in
chat, actively subscribe, tip
creators and provide a high-
value to the platform.

These users actively participate
in live-broadcast chats and
occasionally purchase platform
items.

These users provide the
value to the platform by
producing contents that can
increase viewer count.

<Figure 8: User Participation Rates>

21
A Multi-broadcast Platform based on Blockchain Incentives for Everyone * CASTWEET

Use Group A: Spectators

Comprising about 52% of the users of live-streaming platforms, these users are
merely spectators to the content that they enjoy. They rarely, if ever, do any activity
beyond viewing live-streams for entertainment. In the current model, there is no
motivation for them to participate more actively on the platform themselves, as

current compensation models do not reward them for further engagement.

Use Group B: Engaged viewers

At 30% of the participants on live-streaming platforms, the Engaged viewers
take on a more active role within the platform itself. They will often chat during live-
streams, share the contents they enjoy with others, and occasionally use their own
money to help support their favorite content creators, While their additional activity
within the platform increases the engagement of a live-stream and creates a more
enjoyable platform environment, their participation is limited by the amount of their
own money they would like to use to further support content creators. By providing
them with additional ways to earn within the platform, these users can be promoted

to engage further and take on a more active role.

Use Group C: Highly-engaged Users

Constituting 16% of all the users within a platform, the highly-engaged users
often function as the “Whales” of the live-streaming industry. They actively invest
heir own money to subscribe to various channels across the platform, can provide
ips to creators that can be over $100,000 dollars, and normally actively engage
with the chat and community as a whole. These users are highly motivated by the
eeling they gain after sharing their support in the chat and can help turn an amateur

streamer into a full-time streaming professional. Providing this group with incentives

o even further support streamers, and rewarding them for the activity they are
already created within our level system can push them to increase their value for the

platform as a whole.

22
A Multi-broadcast Platform based on Blockchain Incentives for Everyone * CASTWEET

Use Group D: Content Creators

Making up the final 2% of all the participants on a live-streaming platform, the
content creators themselves provide the viewers with the content that they enjoy
viewing. This group can be further divided into different categories based on their
level of earning and participation: amateurs streaming just for entertainment, indie
or second tier streamers who are working to supplement the income from their
traditional jobs, and professional or full-time streamers who derive all of their income
from their live-streaming activities. On the current existing streaming platforms,
all of the revenue earned from their streams is converted into fiat and used off-
platform. However, by providing real use cases for their earnings within the platform
and additional motivations to use those earnings, a more beneficial ecosystem can

be created within the platform.

3.2 Ecosystem Overview

The main objective of the Castweet Ecosystem is to create a cycle of use within the
platform by providing real use cases within the platform for both the viewers and
content creators. Many previous blockchain-based incentive ecosystems focused
more on the compensation side, providing a way for creators/users to earn, while
ignoring the ability to create real use cases for the tokens within the ecosystem itself.
By providing users with motivation to use their earned rewards within the platform,
the problem of “Token Drain,” or excessive amounts of the tokens being withdrawn

from the platform to an exchange can be solved.

Additionally, by creating more use cases within the platform, both viewers and
creators are also motivated to purchase tokens from the exchange and move them
into the platform for use. Compared to other platforms that limit user registration
(ie: Steemit) or platforms (ie: Dlive, Gifto) that focus heavily on motivating viewers to

purchase tokens to use as tips for their preferred content creators, our system will

23

allow us to create a more open system while providing adequate rewards and uses to

increase user activity.

3.2.1. Two Reward Structure: CTB/CTT

Within the platform, there is a dual reward structure utilizing CTB and CTT. As users
participate on the platform, they are rewarded with CTB tokens, CTB tokens are the
means of exchange and purchase within the platform. These CTB tokens can also
be exchanged for CTT token that can be withdrawn and sent to a cryptocurrency
exchange to sell on the secondary coin market. Additionally, CTT tokens can be
transferred to their in-app wallet and exchanged for CTB tokens in order to be used

for purchases for the in-app ecosystem.

CTB / CTT

CTB/CTT creates an in-platform Ecosytem that can control abuse
and be adjusted

SO -- SO

Points earned on Platform by CTB can be exchanged to CTT in-
viewing, sharing, commenting, platform. The exchange rate is
and streaming. adjustable

<Figure 10: CTB & CTT Exchange>

The separation of in-app points (CTB) and the cryptocurrency tokens (CTT) has a

variety of advantages that can help create a healthier and active ecosystem including :

1) Abstraction of Coin Value - CTB value is separated from the value of CTT when

viewed within the platform. Users are more readily motivated to use the CTB that
they earn as it is not connected to the monetary value. As the value of CTT increases,

the CTB/CTT exchange rate can be adjusted to maintain the health of the ecosystem.

2) Motivation to purchase Tokens on Cryptocurrency Exchange - Similar to how
users purchase in-app currency in games, users will need to purchase CTT tokens
and exchange them to CTB within the app to make purchases. This improves the
health of the CTT token economy as users will move more tokens into the in-app

ecosystem, effectively doing a token buyback for the company itself.

25
A Multi-broadcast Platform based on Blockchain Incentives for Everyone * CASTWEET

3) Limitation of Exchange/Withdraw based on User Level - Users will be limited
on the amount of CTB to CTT that they can exchange or withdraw daily. As their
user level increases, their maximum amount they can exchange can be expanded
as higher level users are less likely to be abuse accounts taking advantage of the

compensation system.

3.2.2. CTB Viewer Gain & Use

As our main objective and differentiation point is to provide viewers with
compensation, the following table shows the ways in which users can earn or use

CTB tokens within the platform itself as well as some explanation of the motivations

for these systems :

Some key features of this system are explained below :

1. Promote more Engagement/Activity of Viewers - Users are encouraged to
participate beyond just viewing the content. By chatting, reviewing, commenting,
and sharing contents they can earn additional CTB awards. This can help improve the
overall activity on the platform and make it more engaging and entertaining for other
users. Additionally, viewers can track their gain of CTB and eventually earn enough

CTB by viewing to help support their preferred content creators.

2. Daily & Monthly Quest System - Based on gamification systems seen in free-
to-play games, users are motivated to accomplish different tasks in order to help
level up their account and gain additional CTB rewards. Examples of quest types
are: accumulate X hours of view time, spend X hours watching a streamer with less
than 100 followers, watch X advertisements, tip X different live-broadcasters, rate X
videos etc. These types of quests are meant to meet a variety of the features of the
platform such as increasing discoverability, increase advertisement watch time, and

improve the circulation of CTB within the platform.

3. Reward directly to Creator - In order to promote our viewers to use their CTB
within the platform instead of exchanging to CTT and selling on an exchange, users
are provided ways to support their favorite creators. By sending CTB in the form of
tips or paying a monthly amount of CTB to subscribe to content creators, users are
incentivized to use CTB more actively. Also, our expected earning rate would allow
users to subscribe to multiple content creators per month so that they can earn the

subscription rewards (special emoticons, chat badge for the creator in chat, etc).

4. In-app purchases - Users can use their earned or exchanged CTB to purchase

special emotions or open loot boxes. These value of these specialized emoticons

27
A Multi-broadcast Platform based on Blockchain Incentives for Everyone * CASTWEET

are created in ways to promote constant purchase such as limited quantity, special-
occasions, collectable and various other mechanisms. Additionally, users can
purchase loot boxes similar to those seen in mobile apps or games which would
contain random rewards at different rates such as additional emoticions, specialized
user badges, and other use exclusive rewards. The mechanics of randomized rewards
promote users to purchase multiple items in order to gain their desired reward as

each reward is not guaranteed.

5. E-commerce - Users can participate in live-streaming e-commerce to purchase
any products directly through the platform. Any earned CTB points can be converted
into CTT and then used to make purchases for off-line goods that can be shipped

directly to the viewer.

3.2.3. CTB Creator Gain & Use

In order to provide content creators with compensation and motivate them to use

the platform, the following table shows the ways in which live-streamers can earn or

use CTB tokens within the platform itself :

1. Provide Revenue through CTB/CTT - Content creators need to be rewarded for
creating the content that entertains the viewers. By providing rewards based on the
blockchain, their compensation and earnings can be both tracked and provide them
with a means to monetize their creations. Their revenue can be given by the platform
based on their view count, engagement by users, and advertising that they run on
the channel itself. This allows a reliable and steady amount of earnings based on
their channel activity. Additionally, Castweet provides a way for users to tip and give a

monthly subscription to their preferred channels.

2. Increase Discoverability - One of the main goals is to increase the discoverability for
new channels or established channels to gain more viewers. By running specialized
bounty campaigns or engaging in our P2P advertising system, content creators can
boost their channel or incentivize other users to view their content by providing
direct rewards. This especially creates a system where lower level streamers can
market their channel directly and can increase the value of CTT tokens as the means

to pay for the service.

3. Provide value to their subscribers - Additionally, by creating subscriber emoticons,
purchasing specialized filters to apply to the stream, or by opening a loot box that
rewards chat viewers, the content creators is further motivated to user their earned

CTB within the platform itself.

3.2.4. In—-platform CTB Cycle (2 Example Cases)

The ultimate goal of the Castweet platform is to provide both viewers and users
with enough utility and use cases to use their token within the platform. In order to

accomplish this, we have created an ecosystem that interlocks, with both users and

29
A Multi-broadcast Platform based on Blockchain Incentives for Everyone * CASTWEET

creators having use cases to reward each other as well as ways in which the used
CTB or CTT will be sent to the platform itself. By creating a flowing system, an active
ecosystem can be maintained and motivate users to purchase CTT off an exchange
for in-app usage. Below are a few use cases to explain in detail our token flow within

the ecosystem.

TOKEN CIRCULATION

Viewer

The user gains CTB for their
viewing, participation, and
sharing of a livestream.

CTB Supply

The company CTB supply
is provided to viewers or
content creators for their
activity on the platform.

Content Creator

The Creator receives CTB
as a tip or as a monthly
subscription fee from the
viewer

P2P Promotion

Using our P2P promotion
system, the Content

Creator can further boost
their contents to increase
ranking on the main feed.

<Figure 11: Token Circulation within the platform>

Example Case 1:
This user has earned enough CTB through accumulating more than 10 hours of
view time so the platform provides the CTB to the user. The User then gives a tip

to the Creator with 70% going to the creator and 30% going to the platform itself.

The creator wants to use their tip to run a P2P marketing campaign and the whole

original tip amount is back in the platform wallet.

Example Use Case 2:

A new creator wants to be able to build their current following on the platform.

Because they do not have enough earned CTB on the platform to run a bounty

campaign, they purchase 1000 CTT on a cryptocurrency exchange. After transferring

to the in-app wallet, they exchange their CTT to CTB. With this CTB, they create a

bounty campaign to motivate users to watch their stream and that amount is sent

to the platform wallet. Once a user has viewed the required time, they are rewarded

with CTB until the amount of the bounty has been used.

3.3. P2P Marketing System & Bounty Campaigns

To increase discoverability on the platform, there are two innovative marketing
solutions that will allow live-streamers to run their own marketing within the
platform. Each system users different mechanics but has the same goal of driving
engagement and views to the creators content. Below is an explanation of these two

unique in-app advertising campaigns :

P2P Marketing System

Castweet has created a user-driven P2P marketing system to solve some of the
issues with discoverability with live-streaming platforms. In the platform, content
creators or live-streaming sellers will be able to create a P2P marketing campaign
in order to feature their stream on a variety of locations within the application itself.
They will have the option to set their desired featured location either on the main
home screen, under the promoted streams tab, or within their stream genre category
(new, gaming, lifestyle, etc.). After choosing the location for their stream, they will
set a budget to run the campaign. Within each target location, a bidding system will
be implemented in which the highest set budget will be featured in that location. If
they have set the highest budget, their campaign will be activated and they will be

featured in their P2P location.

This feature allows the platform itself to add an additional revenue stream and
promotes new content creators to purchase CTT to use within the platform.
Additionally, it should increase discoverability as some locations will be limited by the
streamer level so that high-level streamers cannot out-pay lower level streamers.
Viewers that opt to view streams promoted in the “New Streamer” category will gain

CTB at an increased rate when compared to other streams. Live-streamers focusing
on sales will be able to invest in promoting their stream to increase potential sales. By

providing a direct P2P marketing system, the goal of discoverability can be improved

32
A Multi-broadcast Platform based on Blockchain Incentives for Everyone * CASTWEET

while increasing the value of CTT.

Benefits of the P2P Marketing System:
@ Ability for any streamer to market their stream directly within the platform.
@ New Streamers will be able to feature their stream in special sections.
@ Sliding-scale payment based on streamer level to prevent over-bidding by
established streamers.
@ Various locations for streamers to bid on to feature their content.
@ Providing additional use-cases for CTT within the platform to improve the token

economy.

Bounty Campaign

In another marketing system, both creators and users can create a bounty
campaign to promote their own or favorite live-streamers broadcast. In this
marketing system, users will set a budget for how many new viewers they would like
to gain. Additionally, they can set the amount of compensation for each new viewer
that watches the minimum required viewing time of 1 hour. Their CTB will be sent to
the platform wallet and, if a new viewer watches their stream for the required time,

30% of the CTB paid into the platform will be paid to the user.

This system further creates a way for viewers to both discover new live-streams
while also earning them with CTB. For the content creators, it incentivizes them
to use CTB in order to promote their stream and gain new views or followers. For
the platform, it creates another revenue stream that can help maintain the healthy

ecosystem and help fund the platform itself.

Benefits of the bounty campaigns :
@ Streamers can directly market their stream to new viewers within the platform.

@ Streamers will be able to create a bounty program just from their viewing/

33
A Multi-broadcast Platform based on Blockchain Incentives for Everyone * CASTWEET

streaming rewards.
@ Preferential featuring for streamers at lower-levels will increase discoverability.
@ Viewers will be rewarded for engaging in content they would otherwise ignore.
@ Competition between bounty budgets will improve the overall CTT ecosystem
and motivate exchange purchases of CTT tokens.
@ Abuse prevention system will prevent low level viewers from abusing the

compensation model.

3.4. Revenue Streams

The Castweet project goal is to create multiple revenue streams utilizing both the
CTT token and fiat. By having advertising revenue that is agnostic to the CTT price,
the platform can have more stable revenue and greater access to advertisers that
are not willing to purchase CTT or engage with cryptocurrency exchange purchases.

In order to accomplish this, our revenue streams are expected to be as follows :

CTT Revenue Streams

1. In-app purchases - Users use CTT & CTB to make in-app purchases (emoticons,
digital items, P2P marketing etc.). 100% of the purchase amount is returned to the
platform wallet.

2. In-app Product Sales - Users who make an off-line goods purchase within the
platform will be charged a transaction fee to process the payment.

3. In-app CTB Fee - Castweet will charge a % fee on some activities done within the

platform (bounty campaign, tip creator, etc.)

4. CTT purchased advertising - Advertisers will have the option to pay for their

advertising campaign with CTT purchased off an exchange and paid into the platform

wallet. This will be at a discounted rate to promote the CTT token price to increase.

34
A Multi-broadcast Platform based on Blockchain Incentives for Everyone * CASTWEET

Fiat Revenue Streams

1. Traditional Advertising - After developing a larger user base, CTT will allow
traditional advertisers to pay for advertising campaigns in fiat (at an increased rate
compared to CTT advertising price). Our platform will feature banner advertising and
video advertising (pre-roll, mid-roll, broadcast “ad break”).

2. Online Product Sales - Companies wishing to promote and sell their products
within the platform can create a sales campaign. This campaign will provide a set
of stock that live-streamers can sell within the platform. Providing this stock to

streamers as an option for sales will be charged a nominal fee.

35
A Multi-broadcast Platform based on Blockchain Incentives for Everyone * CASTWEET

4. Platform Components

The Castweet platform has four main components that all interact with each other
to maintain the platform. At the core, is the main Broadcast System which allows
content creators to broadcast their live-streams and viewers to enteract and view
content. Interacting with this, the Reward System provides both the viewers and
content creators to earn from their engagement. While the Reward System provides
compensation for engagement, the User Level System adjusts and controls at what
rate the viewers or content creators can gain from this engagement and also provide
additional benefits to the users, Lastly, the Abuse Detection System measures user
activity to ensure fair compensation and prevent abuse of the overall system to
maintain the health of the overall Castweet Ecosystem. Each component and their

interaction is essential to the proper functioning of Castweet.

4.1 Castweet Broadcast System

The Castweet creator tool and Castweet user timeline page provide an optimized
broadcast environment for a web browser and performance through the Unity 3D
engine and Web GL framework. Cross-compiled using the Web GL platform and web
assembly, the Castweet platform is designed to make it easy for users to access the
platform in any environment where a web browser can operate, regardless of the
platform's configuration and hardware, such as a PC, tablet or any mobile device.
The Castweet platform, which is composed of rather heavy development engines, is
compiled into a simple binary format by using web assembly. Implanting client server
and applications of the Castweet platform into a web browser, memory usage is

reduced with faster performance.

4.2 User Level System

As users engage more on the platform, they will be able to increase their user level.
This conveys additional advantages to both viewers and content creators depending
on their level. During the Alpha and Beta test, a fair level system will be created
by benchmarking user activity rates and making adjustments to ensure users can
level at an acceptable rate while encouraging action. In order to “level up” within the

system, users will need to reach milestones related to :

1. Total view/broadcast time

2. Engagement activity (sharing, commenting, rating content, etc.)
3. Completion of Daily/Weekly Viewing Quests

4. Amount of CTB spent within the system

5, Use of “Level-Boost" Items to increase their level gain.

6. Users introduced through Referral codes to expand the platform

37
A Multi-broadcast Platform based on Blockchain Incentives for Everyone * CASTWEET

Additionally, as a user level increases, various bonuses and advantages to be
conferred onto that user. The following are some of the expected advantages for

increasing user level :

1. Increase of Daily CTB to CTT Conversion

2. Increase of rate of gain for CTB from activity

3. Additional value to streams watched: a higher level user offers more
compensation to content creators for their views than a Level 1 user.

4. Specialized level-based emoticons and user badges

5. Free monthly subscription to a content creator of their choice
**Note: The exact requirements for each level and the ways to increase level will

be set following Alpha & Beta test benchmarking. This information is subject to be

changed or updated**

4.3 Abuse Prevention & Detection System

As seen with previous blockchain-based incentive schemes, the importance of

detection and prevention of abuse accounts is essential to creating a powerful

ecosystem. The Castweet Platform utilizes lessons learned from the first-wave

adaptations of blockchain compensation systems (Steemit, Gifto, etc...) and aims to

solve some of the issues seen with these platforms. Weaknesses in the development

of their ecosystem and prevention systems led to various abuse issues with users

finding loopholes in which to maximize their gain while damaging the ecosystem

developed on the platform.

38
A Multi-broadcast Platform based on Blockchain Incentives for Everyone * CASTWEET

The key features of the system are as follows :

Real-user activity benchmarking - During Alpha and Beta tests, normal user
activity will be measured according to activity (average viewing time, comment
amount, engagement). This data will be used to create a benchmark of normal
usage rates. After setting the rates of normal platform usage, accounts that greatly

surpass average usage will be suspended/banned after account review.

CTB & CTT Exchange System - Ability to adjust the CTB to CTT exchange ratio to

maintain fair bonuses as well as keeping the ecosystem healthy.

User Level System - Low level users will have a limited ability to convert CTB to
CTT and have limitations on daily withdrawal amounts. This prevents issues about
creating multiple accounts in an effort to maximize their rewards. As user level

increases, their value to broadcasters is also increased.

4.4 Castweet Wallet

Castweet will also create a multi-functional cryptocurrency wallet d-App that will
allow users to manage their CTB and CTT. Users can connect their Castweet account
to the associated Castweet wallet d-App and can convert their earned CTB into CTT
depending on their user level. Additionally, users can use the d-App to send and
receive CTT tokens between any valid CTT wallet address. This functionality will allow
users to make payments for purchased items or e-commerce goods directly within
the platform to facilitate a smooth, instant, and at a low-cost. After benchmarking
CTB gains during the alpha/beta test, the Castweet wallet will allow us to adjust the
appropriate exchange rate for the tokens as well as limit withdraw based on user

level to prevent abuse of the platform.

39
A Multi-broadcast Platform based on Blockchain Incentives for Everyone * CASTWEET

4.5 Future Blockchain Development Initiatives

Our initial priority is the development of the CTT Platform and creating an effective
blockchain ecosystem with our CTT token. After the main platform is developed,
future blockchain initiatives are planned to further integrate and expand the
functionality of the platform. These are future blockchain features planned to

implement within the CTT Platform System :

1. CTT Network 2.0 - Development of a decentralized network of node creation
and P2P sharing to lower the overall server costs of the platform. In addition, the
development of a CDIS/RNN neural network can expand upon the platform and

improve functionality.

2. Blockchain-tracked Data Usage - Creating a blockchain-based mechanism that
tracks the user activity and records it into the blockchain. This will allow user data to
be tracked more transparently and users can see how their data is being transferred

to third party partners.

3. Content Analysis and Copyright Detection - As the platform grows, the demands
of controlling unlicensed and copyright abuse are expected to become more
important. To aid in this, we aim to create a copyright detection system based on the
blockchain. This system would analyze and hash the contents of creations and write
it into the blockchain. If a user tried to rebroadcast previously uploaded content, it

would be rejected, thus allowing the copyright to be tracked across the platform.

is intended to provide general information and is not meant to be exhaustive,
comprehensive, or authoritative. Castweet accepts no liability in relation to the
Whitepaper, or any reliance on the Whitepaper, and does not warrant the accuracy or

completeness of the Whitepaper

Castweet tokens may only be purchased pursuant to the Castweet Token Sale -

Terms of Sale.

The risks described below, and or other additional risks presently regarded to be
immaterial actually materialize the commercial viability of the Castweet project and/
or the Castweet Ecosystem may be materially and adversely affected. These risks
could result in the failure of the Token sale, the destruction of the Tokens and/
or termination of the development or operation of the Castweet project and/or

Castweet Ecosystem.

Risks associated with the development and operation of the Castweet project and/

or the Castweet Ecosystem:

The Castweet project and/or the Castweet Ecosystem are still under development
and may undergo significant changes before they are released or implemented.
While Castweet intends for the tokes and the Castweet Ecosystem to function
as described in the Whitepaper, Castweet may have to make changes to various

features of specifications of the tokens or the Castweet Ecosystem.

The Castweet ecosystem may fail to be adequately developed or maintained or may

encounter difficulties during development or operation, including financial, resourcing

43
A Multi-broadcast Platform based on Blockchain Incentives for Everyone * CASTWEET

and technical difficulties. This may create the risk that the tokens or the Castweet
Ecosystem may not meet your expectations at the time of the Payment and may
negatively impact the Castweet Ecosystem and the Tokens, and the potential utility

of the tokens.

Since the Services involve the use, purchase or sale of broadcasted videos, this is
applicable to intellectual property laws and may create the risk of infringing other
person's intellectual property rights. This may negatively impact the Castweet

Ecosystem and the Tokens, and the utility of the Tokens.

Risks arising from no governance rights: The Tokens confer no governance rights
of any kind with respect to the Castweet project, the Castweet Ecosystem and/or
Castweet. Accordingly, all decisions involving the Castweet project, the Castweet
Ecosystem and/or Castweet will be made by Castweet at its sole discretion, including
decisions to discontinue the Castweet's products or services, the Castweet project
and/or the Castweet Ecosystem, or to sell or liquidate Castweet. These decisions
could adversely affect the Castweet project and/or the Castweet Ecosystem and
the utility of the Tokens that you own, including the Tokens utility for obtaining the

services.

Risk of failure, abandonment or delay of the Castweet project: The creation of
the Tokens and the development of the Castweet project and/or the Castweet
Ecosystem may fail, be abandoned or delayed for a number of reasons, including
lack of interest from the public, lack of funding, or lack of commercial success or

prospects (e.g. caused by competing projects).

Risks associated with the Ethereum blockchain: The Tokens, the Token Sale
and/or the Castweet Ecosystem are based on the Ethereum blockchain which is

still in development stage and unproven. Any malfunction, flaws, breakdown or

44
A Multi-broadcast Platform based on Blockchain Incentives for Everyone * CASTWEET

abandonment of the Ethereum blockchain may have a material adverse effect on the
Tokens, the Token Sale and/or the Castweet Ecosystem. Furthermore, developments
in cryptographic technologies and techniques or changes in the consensus protocol
or algorithms could present risks to the Tokens, the Token sale and/or the Castweet
Ecosystem, including the utility of the Tokens for obtaining the Services, by rendering
ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins the Ethereum

blockchain.

Risk of Ethereum mining attacks: As with other cryptocurrencies, the Ethereum
blockchain is susceptible to mining attacks, including double-spend attacks, majority
mining power attacks, "selfish-mining" attacks, and race condition attacks. Any
successful attacks present a risk to the Tokens, the Token Sale, and/or the Castweet
Ecosystem, including proper execution and sequencing of transactions involving the

tokens.

Risk of theft: The Ethereum blockchain may be exposed to attacks by hackers or
other individuals that could result in the theft or loss of ETH, or the tokens, impacting

the ability to develop the Castweet Ecosystem.

Regulatory risks: It is possible that certain jurisdictions will apply existing
regulations on, or introduce new regulations addressing, blockchain technology,
which may be contrary to the Token and/or the Castweet Ecosystem and which may,
inter alia, result in substantial modifications of the Castweet Ecosystem and/or the

Castweet project, including termination and the loss of Tokens.
Risk associated with other applications: The Castweet project may give rise to other

alternative projects promoted by unaffiliated third parties, under which the Tokens

will have no intrinsic value.

45
A Multi-broadcast Platform based on Blockchain Incentives for Everyone * CASTWEET

Risk or loss of private key: The Tokens may be accessed with a combination of
private key and password. The private key is encrypted with a password. Loss of
requisite private key(s) associated with your digital wallet or vault storing the Tokens

will result in loss of such Tokens which will be unrecoverable and permanently lost.

Risks of hacking and security weakness: The tokens, the Token Sale, the Castweet
Ecosystem (if and when developed) and Castweet may be targeted by hackers or
malicious groups of organizations which may attempt to interfere with the Castweet
Ecosystem or the Tokens and/or the Token Sale or steal the Tokens in various
ways, including malware attacks, distributed denial of service, consensus-based
attacks, Sybil attacks, phishing, smurfing and hacking. Furthermore, there is a risk
that a third party or a member of Castweet may intentionally or unintentionally
introduce weakness into the core infrastructure of the Castweet Ecosystem, which
could negatively affect the Castweet Ecosystem, the Tokens and/or the Token Sale,

including the utility of the Tokens for obtaining Services,

Risks associated with taxation: The tax treatment and accounting of the Tokens
is uncertain and may vary amongst jurisdictions. You must seek independent tax
advice in connection with purchasing the Tokens, which may result in adverse tax

consequences to you.

Risks associated with volatility of ETH/BTC: The value of ETH/BTC may fluctuate
significantly over a short period of time as a result of various factors including market
dynamics, regulatory changes, technical advancements, and economic and political
factors. Due to such volatility, Castweet may not be able to fund the development of
the Castweet Ecosystem, or may not be able to maintain the Castweet Ecosystem in

the manner that is intended.

Technology risks: The Tokens are intended to represent a new capability on

46
A Multi-broadcast Platform based on Blockchain Incentives for Everyone * CASTWEET

emerging technology that is not fully proven in use. As the technology matures, new
capabilities may dramatically after the usefulness of the Tokens or the ability to use
or sell them. The functionality of the Tokens is complex, will require enhancements
and product support over time, and full functionality may take longer than expected.
The full functionality of the Tokens is not yet complete and no assurance can be

provided of such completion.

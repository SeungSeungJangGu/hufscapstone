GINcoin Overview

GINcoin, with its GUI-based Masternode deployment platform enables
crypto investors to set up their own Masternodes regardless of their
technical skills and experience in working with servers and programming
languages.
Foreword

About GINcoin, cryptocurrencies
and Masternodes
Foreword

What is a cryptocurrency?

Acryptocurrency (or crypto currency) is a digital asset
designed to work as a medium of exchange.
Cryptocurrencies use cryptography (hence the name)
to secure transactions, control the creation of
additional units, and verify the transfer of assets.

The control mechanisms of cryptocurrencies are
decentralized and managed through a blockchain (a
form of public transaction database) that works as a
distributed ledger.

The decentralisation aspect is what sets them apart
the most from most other types of currencies
(especially fiat currencies).

What are Masternodes?

From a technical point of view, a masternode is a
computer (server) with a publicly available IP address.

A Masternode is simply a cryptocurrency full node or
computer wallet that keeps the full copy of the
blockchain in real-time.

Masternodes are active members in a coin’s
transaction network that meet certain criteria, the
most important of which is a set amount of collateral
capital locked in a dedicated wallet.
Foreword - What are Masternodes?

Wallets

There are 2 types of wallets that
can be used:

Hot wallets

Hot wallets are stored on the
server itself and are connected to
the internet. This makes them
more susceptible to being broken
into than cold wallets.

Cold wallets

If a wallet is stored on a computer
that’s not always connected to the
internet (or on a storage device like

the Ledger Nano)

Similarities to savings
accounts

Throughout their short history,
masternodes have been compared
to savings accounts - they play an
important role in the coin network
and those who create and
maintain them get rewarded for
their efforts - much like a bank
offers savings with varying interest
rates to encourage people to hold
their money with it.

Nodes vs Masternodes

Masternodes are considerably
different in their functionality than
normal nodes.

Apart from keeping a copy of the
full blockchain in real-time and
relaying blocks/transactions, just
like a full node does on the Bitcoin
network, Masternodes fulfill other
functions as well:

Increase the privacy of
transactions

Enable users to instantly
send funds to one another
Participate in governance/
voting

Some serve the role of a
treasury in some coin
networks
Foreword - Why are Masternodes good for Crypto?

Increased decentralisation

Through the functions mentioned
above, Masternodes ensure
cryptocurrencies remain as
decentralised as possible,
counterbalancing the inherent
centralisation mining pools
introduce. At the same time,
Masternodes help increase the
scalability of the network and can
be used as a means of voting ona
coin’s developmental decisions -
much like what happens in your
usual corporation when
shareholders are asked to weigh in
on policy or direction changes.

Decreased energy costs

On top of all of this, Masternodes
are useful because they
compensate for proof of work’s
(POW) limitations and ensure a
network’s security with much
lower energy costs. In a sense, a
POW-based coin that supports
Masternodes is a mixed breed
between a pure POW one anda
POS (proof of stake) coin.

Better security

Because Masternodes require
capital to be deployed, their
owners are directly interested in
keeping the network as secure as
possible. As such, Masternodes are
designed to keep miners in line -
for instance, Dash Masternodes
keep a close eye on the POW
network (the miners) and reject/
orphan blocks if they don’t match
the current version of Dash or if
they detect reward tampering.

The problem(s)

Masternodes and people are
complex machines
The problem(s)

GINcoin aims to solve two big issues that are currently
holding Masternode coins back and impeding their
rightful ascent:

Deploying and running a Masternode requires
significant technology know-how:
Deep understanding of the blockchain
Launching & maintaining a server
Setting up of masternode software
Setting up a Masternode requires considerable
financial efforts (and, as detailed below, trust)

The two problems force investors to rely on Shared
Masternode groups and schemes, usually lead by a
developer willing to do the work in exchange for a

share of the Masternode (or its generated rewards).

This forces a trustless-system to work ina
trust-dependent way, and not few are the cases where
ill-intentioned individuals scam investors and keep the
collateral for themselves.

Trustless, Codeless Masternode
Deployment
GINcoin - Trustless, Codeless Masternode Deployment

Overview

GINcoin was built as a direct
consequence of the problems
stated before. With its GUI-based
Masternode setup, the only hurdle
investors may be faced with when
looking to own a Masternode
remains the financial one -
securing enough collateral to
actually deploy the node. However,
not even that will remain a valid
problem for much longer - our
roadmap includes shared
Masternode support for all partner
coins.

GINcoin is a peer-to-peer
cryptocurrency that, on top of
Bitcoin's features, supports instant
transactions (InstantSend), private
transactions (PrivateSend) and
Masternodes. It is based on Dash.

Masternodes

Similar to Dash, GINcoin uses a
two-tiered network - miners, the
first tier, handle creating new
blocks, whereas the PrivateSend,
InstantSend and Governance
functions are handled by the
second tier network made up of
Masternodes.

Masternodes require 1,000 GIN as
collateral to prevent sybil attacks
(wherein a peer-to-peer network’s
reputation system is compromised
by entities with forged identities).
The collateral can be spent at any
time, but that subsequently
eliminates the masternode from
the network.

PrivateSend

At its core, PrivateSend is a service
that mixes users coins with others’
coins before sending them to a
wallet, to ensure their anonymity.
It is based on CoinJoin, to which it
adds multiple modifications such
as relying on masternodes rather
than ona single website, chaining
by mixing with multiple
masternodes and restricting the
mixing to only accept certain

denominations, and passive mode.

The maximum allowed for a
PrivateSend transaction is 1000
GIN (just like with Dash).

InstantSend

Reliant on the Masternode network, InstantSend is
allows for near-instant transactions - through it, inputs
can be locked to specific transactions and verified by
consensus of the masternode network. Conflicting
transactions and blocks are rejected. If a consensus
cannot be reached, validation of the transaction
occurs through standard block confirmation.
InstantSend solves the double-spending problem
without the longer confirmation times of other
cryptocurrencies (e,g,: Bitcoin).

GINcoin - Trustless, Codeless Masternode Deployment

A GUI-based
Masternode Deployment Platform

The coin itself is a close sibling of Dash’s. Where GINcoin truly shines is its codeless masternode deployment platform.
The platform itself is web-based and relies on open source technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, Node.js, Angular.js
and Linux.

Setting up a Masternode is simple and straightforward, as shown in the screenshots below, which cover the first two
steps.

Internal economy

Self-sustaining

The coin itself will derive value from the platform that
it maintains. Aside from free trades on exchanges, GIN
will be used by our community to cover:

Masternode hosting fees
Masternode setup fees
Shared masternode setup fees

Beneficial to other coins

As such, GIN not only relies on other
Masternode-compatible coins, but also helps them
grow faster by enabling investors from all walks of life
to create, maintain and invest in Masternodes.

Our Mission & Vision

GINcoin aims to provide cryptocurrency investors with an easy way of creating and deploying their own masternode(s) =
regardless of their technical abilities.

Our ultimate goal is to democratise the way masternodes are created and, as an effect, prove crypto is here to stay - by
making it more secure and more user-friendly than paper money.

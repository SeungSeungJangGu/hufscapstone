1 Introduction

1.1 Market Capacity

1.1.1 China

In 2016, the market for individual credit loans in China has reached 23 trillion RMB,
and recorded a 21.1% increase from 2015. Total business is expected to retain an
annual growth of over 20% each year and to reach 41 trillion CNY in 2019, which
would be quintuple the market size in 2010. The size of the consumer financing and
credit loan market in China is rapidly increasing and promises a continued potential
for growth.

Additionally, the Chinese credit evaluation market is experiencing a steady growth
respectively. However, due to regulatory uncertainty and the difficulties of data
acquisition, the market penetration for individual credit remains at about 9%,
signifying an untapped potential for growth.

1.1.2 Southeast Asia

There is a population of 600 million in Southeast Asia, in which only 27% of the local
residents have their own bank accounts. Market data shows a surprisingly low number
of credit card ownership: 6% in Indonesia, 5% in the Philippines and 3% in Vietnam.
In comparison, 80% of US citizens can access and utilize credit services.
Additionally, only a very limited amount of the population is covered by official
credit scoring agencies although the awareness of credit loans is relatively strong in
these areas. A well-developed credit scoring system would enable local institutions to
develop consumer-financing businesses, leading to economic growth. Taking Vietna
for example, 40% of cell phone sales are done through installments despite the low
market penetration of mobile phones. The demand for credit loans is clearly very
strong. A developed credit system would assist the development of the consumer
finance industry and boost the domestic economy. The Linkeye project can provide
this system in these regions by building a credit scoring alliance.

The current size of the credit loan market in Southeast Asia is relatively small in
relation to its population size. However, with the rapid growth of the market at a 10%
growth rate year on year, the credit industry is poised for take-off.

1.1.3 Europe

Although Europe has been contributing to the global credit loan market as a key
market player, it has stagnated in recent years due to the financial crisis in 2008 and
debt crisis in 2009. In 2015, the annual credit balance of the 28 European Union
countries recorded 1.12 trillion EUR, showing a 2.9% increase from 2014, the first
increase since 2008. The UK (329 billion Euro), Germany (225 billion Euro) and
France (153 billion Euro) are the top 3 contributors to the European credit loan
market. In conclusion, the market capacity is huge for Europe and further recovery
will lead to rapid growth.

LinkEye—Blockchain-Based Credit Alliance 5

1.2 Problem

1.2.1 China
e Limited credit coverage and access by the Central Bank

The People's Bank of China did not establish its nationwide unified database of
financial credit information until 2006. It is a relatively short period of time for the
system to improve. And due to the peculiarities and uniqueness of the Central Bank’s
system, the credit scoring provided is not well established, showing a lack of
consistency and unification. At present, there are only 300 million individual credit
profiles recorded in the Central Bank’s database. However, the limited accessibility to
the database makes it difficult for non-government institutions to inquire and upload
credit reports.

e Extensively distributed credit information

Credit data in China is isolated and distributed among various banks, small loan
companies and lending platforms. The credit data collected is often fragmented,
preventing synergy and creating a barrier to common credit application.

e Weak sense of punishment in existing credit system

The current system of disciplinary punishment in the credit industry is incomplete
which makes the cost of breaching relatively low. Therefore, there is a series of
dishonest behavior such as commercial fraud, breach of contract, tax fraud and
evasion. As China's credit industry started late with a low social awareness of credit,
there is a definite need for a comprehensive credit environment.

e The market’s needs for credit system

As of now, there are more than 1,500 problematic lending platforms reported by the
government and media. Liquidity crises are largely caused by bad debts, which
eventually leads to the collapse of most platforms. Meanwhile, the market requires
new credit information platforms that provide reliable, effective, open and transparent
data in order to support the development of the credit industry.

1.2.2 Southeast Asia

e The general financial system in Southeast Asia is underdeveloped but rapidly
booming, offering great opportunities to the credit business. Take Indonesia for
example, where less than 30% of the 300-million population has a bank account
of which only 6% uses credit cards. In comparison, the penetration of bank
accounts in China has reached 80% and the figure for Hong Kong and India is
96% and 50% respectively.

e An obstacle exits in the form of fragmented credit data due to an inadequate
government credit system and underdeveloped commercial credit bureau.

LinkEye—Blockchain-Based Credit Alliance 6
Linkey>

1.2.3 Europe

The financial industry in Europe is dominated by a public credit system initiated by
the European Central Bank. The centralized credit system and database is non-profit
and funded by the government, so that most credit institutions are operated by the
Central Bank or managed by major national financial institutions. This creates several
deficiencies as listed below:

e The fiscal burden of investment in credit systems is huge. It takes extensive
investment from the government to establish these credit databases with high
maintenance and operation costs.

e There is less room for market-oriented operation creating a limitation on the
range of services to be offered. Public credit is not conducive to various types of
credit information integration and penetration, and is especially inadequate for
credit information services and service experience.

e The traditional credit system provides limited support to the local economy. The
consumption market in Europe is relatively weak and would benefit from a more
flexible and advanced credit system.

1.3 Solution

Based on the struggles of the credit markets in China, Southeast Asia, and Europe,
Linkeye has a clear entry point into the industry. By utilizing blockchain technology
and a credit economy model, Linkeye can create a shared list of untrusted profiles
within the credit alliance by connecting isolated islands of credit data, and eventually
solving the problems of high costs, data discrepancy, lack of accessibility, and talent
shortages. With this, Linkeye serves to boost economic growth and achieve fairness
by forming a comprehensive, trustworthy credit system of the entire population.

LinkEye—Blockchain-Based Credit Alliance 7

2 Why LinkEye

2.1 Vision and Mission

LinkEye (LET) is an independently developed Hyperledger Fabric-based consortium
blockchain solution with an Achain-based token system that has been built and
optimized specifically for the credit industry. This purpose-built system facilitates a
global credit alliance, as well as the development of an open and global credit-based
society on both a technological and financial level.

Utilizating blockchain technology and a credit economy model enables Linkeye to
create a shared list of untrusted profiles within the credit alliance by connecting
isolated islands of credit data. The ultimate goal is to achieve fairness through credit
by forming a wide-range trustworthy credit system of the entire society.

LinkEye is committed to building the first blockchain-based Credit Alliance, focusing
on building a platform with a database of fraudulent people by recruiting members for
the alliance. The project requires honesty in society — fraudulent people won’t be able
to gain access to financial services while trustworthy people enjoy good social
resources.

2.2 Current State of Credit Assessment

Information Technology advancement is making data processing more efficient and
effective in providing support for an enterprise’s operations and decision-making,
which will lead to an immense demand for big-data analytics in every industry. With
rapid growth in the credit business, huge amounts of data are being produced.
However, traditional credit agencies are only able to focus on their niches, given the
dramatic increase in quantity and depth of the data, such as CreditVision for financial
institutions and DriverRisk for insurance companies. A single customer could
correspond to different pieces of credit data from various credit data institutions,
which makes it impossible to form a comprehensive credit profile. Decisions made
from fragmented data may lead to inaccurate and risky decisions with unwarranted
consequences. Linkeye’s mission is to generate comprehensive credit assessments by
connecting all the isolated islands of credit information. In addition to that, the
platform will ensure that credit reports are accessible and transferable among alliance
members.

2.3. Advantages

2.3.1 Blockchain-based

A traditional data center stores data on a central server that is fully controlled by a
data center in which the data is susceptible to modification. In such cases, there are

LinkEye—Blockchain-Based Credit Alliance 8
Linkey>

risks that the data could be tampered with, deleted, or sold to other parties by data
centers for profit. With the current models of data unions, a number of small data
centers will usually be attached to a large data center for data exchange. All data
transactions made would go through a large data center, opening up the possibility of
collusion or theft of the data due the control of one institution.

Blockchain is a decentralized distributed data storage technology. It is a secure and
reliable system that facilitates data transactions between institutions and individuals
without a central authority. Powered by cryptography, decentralized consensus, and
peer-to-peer network communication, blockchain prevents data from being tampered
with or deleted. Utilizing such technology allows Linkeye to ensure that data is
trustworthy and permanent once being published on a blockchain, resulting in a
trusted data system.

2.3.2 Industry Insights

LinkEye is operated by a team of financial professionals with years of experience in
both traditional banking and Fintech. The team has developed its own insight on the
credit business and IT, allowing them to strategically plan and deliver the project.

2.3.3 Success and Achievements

Linkeye’s founding team has a deep understanding of and a comprehensive skill set in
risk management, business development and product development. Working together
for over three years, the team has accomplished many milestones which include
developing a credit platform with over 1,000 credit financing service providers,
operating a payment platform with monthly transaction amounts of 5 billion RMB and
a technology-driven micro financing service platform serving millions of users.

2.3.4 Resources

The key to developing a credit union is partnering with many qualified members.
After working in the credit industry for years, the Linkeye team has been able to
swiftly kick-start this project by generating millions of initial credit data points
through the establishment of strategic partnerships with credit loan agencies in China
and Malaysia. The accumulation of this initial data is expected to exceed tens of
millions in the near term.

3 How LinkEye Works

The LinkEye team innovatively built a credit alliance based on blockchain technology
with a proposed Eight Core Mechanisms, which was generally recognized by the
industry to ensure the efficient functionality of the alliance. It is a breakthrough in
blockchain in terms of being the first substantive application in the field of credit
scoring.

3.1 Blacklist Mechanism

The Blacklist Mechanism enables the publication of fraudulent activities within the
credit alliance with a strong consideration of privacy — the data will be desensitized
and posted in a masked format. A sample of Linkeye data format is shown below:

Linkeye ID + Masked ID (such as 220403198011 ******) + credit score + publisher
(anonymous) + signature.

A blacklist of untrusted individuals published by members of the alliance contains
two parts - public data and detailed info. The public data will be shown and the
detailed info (LinkEye template + alliance member customized data) will be stored in
the blockchain including user ID, full name, time of loan, loan amount, lending
platform, overdue time and category. LinkEye requires alliance members to sign an
agreement with the borrower prior to the issue of credit loan to disclose the
publication on LinkEye in the event of frauds.

3.2 Membership Mechanism

To ensure the integrity and effectiveness of the data, LinkEye will establish a strict
standard for reviewing and qualifying the alliance members. The first batch of
members will be reputable brands in the industry. Alliance members must use real
names for registration and will have the option to publish dishonest information via
real name or anonymous.

3.3 Credit Mechanism

To regulate alliance members and prevent data fraud, the credit profile of each
alliance member will be disclosed in real time. Each member receives an initial credit
score of 100. Once dishonest behavior is detected, 5 points will be deducted from the
score and will be broadcasted to the alliance. Members will be eliminated from the
Linkeye Alliance when their credit score reaches 0.

LinkEye—Blockchain-Based Credit Alliance 10
Linkey>

3.4 Arbitration Mechanism

When a member holds objections or questions to a piece of data published by another
member, it has the right to file arbitration with the LinkEye Foundation. The
arbitration will be organized by the foundation. Each of the members hold 1 vote
while the Linkeye Foundation holds 33.3% of the vote. The arbitration will be
resolved when over 50% members approve, with one day allocated for decisions.

3.5 Information Sharing Mechanism

The user ID is the only match for members when querying data. The data can only be
accessed and exchanged when the user ID is a perfectly match. Alliance members are
allowed to view a detailed version of individual credit reports from other member by
using LET tokens. The detailed version shares the same signature with the published
version to ensure the accuracy of the data.

3.6 Smart Pricing Mechanism

LinkEye executes a smart real-time pricing mechanism that enables all members to
publish credit data at a slightly lower price than market value to avoid blocking data
exchanges due to LET price fluctuations.

3.7 Data Security Firewall Mechanism

LinkEye sets up data security firewalls to prevent data from being compromised.
Alarm triggers are set up based on application conditions to block abnormal queries.
Members will be eliminated in severe cases once triggering the security alarm.

3.8 Open API Mechanism

The Linkeye Foundation provides an external query interface open to external parties.
Any user can access the public blacklist by entering the full ID and gain detailed
reports by using LET.

This mechanism increases the punishment to dishonest behavior and makes it
impossible to hide a fraudulent history. This enables LinkEye to serve a
groundbreaking role in building a credit-worthy society for all. This also serves to
greatly increase the exposure of the platform and liquidity of LET.

4 Technical Features

LinkEye (LET) is an independently developed Hyperledger Fabric-based consortium
blockchain solution with an Achain-based token system that has been built and
optimized specifically for the credit industry.

LinkEye’s system will be made up of consortium blockchains in different countries
that each store credit data according to their rules and regulations. Application
Programming Interfaces (APIs) of credit data will be connected and accessed between
these different consortium blockchains; and eventually form a global network of
credit data union.

These consortiums are built on top of Fabric, the most popular blockchain platform
within Hyperledger. It was first submitted to the Hyperledger community by IBM in
2015 and has been continuously improved upon by many community contributors. In
China, Fabric has been successfully applied to the field of financial, supply chain, and
asset ownership etc. and has become the preferred framework for many blockchain
solutions.

The Hyperledger Fabric is built based on the below architecture:

@)

In order to provide a trustworthy and scalable token, LET tokens are issued separately
on Achain, a smart contract blockchain with higher throughput and lower fees than
competing platforms such as Ethereum. Meanwhile, development is underway on
LinkEye’s own public blockchain to which LET tokens will be migrated once
finished. LinkEye’s public chain is based on Ethereum but will utilize Delegated
Proof of Stake for consensus rather than Proof of Work in order to provide the high
throughput necessary to serve fast growing economies.

4.1 Data Security

Linkeye utilizes the combination of symmetric and asymmetric encryption to
safeguard the data. In addition, the digital signature mechanism ensures the integrity
and authenticity of the information.

4.2 Scalability and Performance

LinkEye independently realized that Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT),
recommended by IBM, which remarkably improves the writing performance.

Using symmetric encryption, Linkeye can encrypt data 500 - 1000 times faster than
the asymmetric-only encryption employed by Ethereum. At the same time, the
optimization of CIFS increases the data synchronization and transmission between
nodes. We have achieved a performance of 10,000 transactions per second in our test

environments.

4.3 Easy to Access

As the data is written into the blockchain via API by the members of the alliance, the
Linkeye platform automatically provides all data searching and profit allocation. Such
a mechanism minimizes the cost of additional development to all members using
Linkeye’s SDK.

LinkEye—Blockchain-Based Credit Alliance 14

5 LinkEye Token (LET)

5.1 Introduction

The LinkEye Token, or LET is a contract token issued on Achain to ensure efficiency
on the Linkeye platform. By using LET, the platform achieves high-speed, low-cost,
and real-time database accounting. By combining LET and smart contracts,
peer-to-peer data sharing is truly realized so that the complexity and risks caused by a
centralized clearing house are avoided.

5.2 Token Usage

LET will be used as a user's credentials for querying data on the LinkEye platform.
The user queries the data for a certain amount of LETs, and alliance members are able
to earn LET by listing the data. LET can be obtained by sharing data from LinkEye
platform or acquired from a secondary marketplace.

6 Halo World Mobile App

6.1 Introduction

There are only a few personal data dimensions in the traditional credit industry. Since
data quality is limited, it is difficult to outline a complete portrait of user credit. At the
same time, individuals don’t want their credit data to be used in different scenarios
due to safety concerns. This situation means valuable data cannot fully realize its
value.

Halo World is developed under this basis. This blockchain-based DApp
(Decentralized Application) aims to build a decentralized credit and transaction
management platform for financial services and credit applicants. It allows each
participant to establish their own personal credit data sovereignty and credit assets,
via a smart contract platform. Through Halo World, a user’s social background can
create more meaningful value together with other high-quality credit individuals.

6.2 Features

Blockchain-based Technology:

Based on blockchain technology, Halo World has created a decentralized, secure, and
trusted data center. Users can store their own data licenses in the blockchain knowing
it will remain secure via cryptography.

Personal Credit Data Authentic Right:

With blockchain technology, users can literally own their own data. Third-party
platforms cannot use data without a users’ authorization. This solves the issue of
unauthorized use of user data by third parties. This collection of secure personal data
takes the form of a “Credit Passport".

Improving Credit Scenarios:

LinkEye will cooperate with major financial institutions to launch various financial
services and preferential transaction tokens. A user's data can be matched to the
perfect offline usable scenario. In the end, users with good credit data can enjoy better
offline services.

Risk Management Platform:

For the institutions that have joined, it is possible to manage risk through the
user-authorized historical credit assessment, anti-fraud, and credit risk prediction
ecosystems. This serves to eliminate the occurrence of default events from the source.

LinkEye—Blockchain-Based Credit Alliance 16
Linkey>

6.3 Roadmap

The First Stage: April 2018

The construction of the Dapp’s prototype is quickly nearing completion. The first
phase of product and operation is mainly focused on attracting and retaining a large
number of users through interactive events such as daily promotions, including but
not limited to, mining LinkEye Tokens (LET) once the Main Chain is online and
participating in web-based gaming on platforms like Gold Miner. In the process of
gaming, users can voluntarily fill out information and provide the underlying data to
support for the formation of personal "Credit Passports".

The Second Stage: June 2018

As a user’s credit passport data is gradually perfected, they gain access to more
exclusive services. LinkEye will cooperate with major financial platforms/institutions
and add various financial services and preferential transaction tokens, which will
enable users with better credit history to obtain better financial services. This will
enable individual social credit passports to play an important role in the financial
industry.

The Third Stage: Future

Fully complete the “Personal Credit Passport” with access to multiple areas of social
life such as consumption, medical care, education, travel, etc. This will allow users’
credit passports to pass through more scenes, allowing passport holders to enjoy
higher quality social services and resources.

7 Business Model

7.1 Revenue Model

7.1.1 Blacklist

The supply of credit blacklists usually stems from government credit agencies and
private credit companies in Linkeye’s target market. However, it is usually very
painful when a lending institution acquires blacklists from the mentioned parties:
dealing with multiple parties, complicated procedure, repeated costs on every credit
search.

As a member of the LinkEye Credit Alliance, a lending institution is able to access the
credit blacklist on the conso  rtium-blockchain published by other members. It only
has to pay a certain amount of Linkeye Tokens (LET) to acquire the detailed credit
report. The amount of LET to be paid will be decided by the market value. Linkeye
will withdraw 0.5 LET from each transaction as a commission to support the
operation with token draws frozen for 2 years before release.

7.2 Sustainability

7.2.1 Sustainable Industry Growth

From its historical performance, we can forecast that credit financing will hold its role
as an evergreen industry that boosts the global economy. The sustainability of the
industry has ensured the sustainability of its projects to a certain extent.

7.2.2 Sustainable Open Operation

LinkEye—Blockchain-Based Credit Alliance 18
Linkey>

The committee of Linkeye Foundation shall be elected by the alliance members with
the continuous improvement of the technology and operation. In such way, Linkeye
can operate in an independent and sustainable way akin to Bitcoin.

7.2.3 Sustainable Token Economy
Every token withdrawn from query or transaction will be released after 2 years to

ensure a reasonable and effective circulation. Such a mechanism would guarantee the
sustainability of the LET economy and Linkeye operation.

8 LinkEye Roadmap

8.1 Phase One: Completion of the alliance platform to share credit

blacklist (Completed in February 2018)

LinkEye is committed to building the first blockchain-based Credit Alliance, focusing
on completing the platform and its database of fraudulent people by recruiting
members for the alliance. At this stage, the project reinforce honesty to society —
fraudulent people won’t be able to gain access to financial services.

A soft launch of the platform was executed in February of 2018 to support data access
from China, Southeast Asia and Europe. Local teams were formed to further develop
the target markets. The blacklist now exists, with every organization possessing their
own blacklist. They can now exchange data on the LinkEye platform using LET to
pay for individual credit reports.

8.2 Phase Two : Expansion of service scope — launch of “Credit

Whitelist” (2018-2019)

The scope of service of Linkeye will be expanded to personal credit evaluation by
building individual profile. Building a more effective credit scoring system enable the
trusted individual to enjoy better financial services and resources. At this stage,
Linkeye aims to provide strong support for the rapid development of the credit
industry. Estimated time of completion is mid-2019.

8.3 Phase Three : Establishment of enterprise credit system (2019)

An expansion of service scope from an individual profile to an enterprise profile
would occur. Through involving enterprise as an important participant in the credit
financing industry, Linkeye is able to complete the establishment of an efficient credit
system of the society.

8.4 Phase Four: Credit to everything

LinkEye will extend its services from finance industry to other segments of society.
All credit related behaviors of individuals and enterprises will be recorded and stored
in blockchain. At this stage, Linkeye will realize its ultimate goal - to achieve fairness
by forming a comprehensive trustworthy credit system of the entire society.

9 Team

9.1 Linkeye Foundation

LinkEye Foundation (hereinafter referred to as "Foundation") is set up and operates in
Singapore. It is committed to promoting LinkEye's development and its transparency
of governance so as to promote the safe, efficient and orderly development of the
Alliance. The Foundation will help to manage the general issues and privileges of the

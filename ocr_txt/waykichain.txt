Extract

WaykiChain is a brand new and powerful underlying system of Blockchain 3.0 based
on Bitcoin and Ethereum. It is committed to provide enterprise-level blockchain
infrastructure and industry solutions. By fully integrating the characteristics of the
distributed ledger, distributed database, smart contract, programmable digital currency,
as well as the value transfer protocol, WaykiChain will help to build and develop a
new business model which belongs to the information society and is totally different
from that in the industrial society, and thus will thoroughly subvert three traditional
industries worthy of hundreds billions of dollars, including the financial industry in
terms of the assets trading and distribution method, the foreign currency exchange
market in terms of the acceptance method and the betting industry in terms of the old
and tedious business model.

Thanks to the developing and innovating blockchain technology, widely used
business applications and proper governance, WaykiChain has core competitive
advantages in the following fields:

@ Technology: WaykiChain has a mature and powerful technology team which has
not only accumulated resourceful industrial and technological experiences in many
sectors including finance, entertainment and IT, etc., but also achieved pioneering
breakthroughs in R & D and the application of the blockchain technology.

technology expertise, but also on experienced professionals who come from target
traditional industries. Moreover, WaykiChain team has built strategic relationships with
target industry firms, which will provide support for the application of WaykiChain.

@ Business governance: unlike common public blockchains, WaykiChain has a clear
and accurate strategy towards target industries. Thanks to the characteristics of the
blockchain technology, such as the distributed decentralization, irreversibility,
encrypted security as well as the point-to-point value transfer, WaykiChain will
professionally and persistently permeate into the target industries and gain market
shares in a fast way.

Part I Design ideas of WaykiChain

1.1 Development and value of blockchain

After more than 40 years of development, internet has brought about new things and
new concepts, such as email, network company, social media, mobile network, big
data, cloud calculation, internet of things, etc. Internet has drastically reduced the cost
relating to searching, coordination and information exchange, radically lowered the
entry threshold in many fields, boosted new media, new entertainment and new retails
and finally generated the brand new organizational architecture model as well as the
unprecedented digital business model.

Thanks to the sensor technology, internet has fully permeated the environment where
human beings reside. However, for business and economic activities, simple
information sharing and transmission cannot meet the development of the economic
society. When there is no verification information from the third party (for example,
verification of the transactor's identification, qualification, technological capability
carried out by banks or government authorities), people cannot rapidly verify the
identification of the transactor. These transactors involved cannot establish a
relationship of trust which is necessary in economic activities. Therefore, current
internet information sharing and transmission solutions, if not relying on the third
party intermediary, cannot realize the function of identity verification, nor can it
establish a relationship of trust between the two economic participants. Huge
limitations still exist.

It was not until 2008 that Satoshi Nakamoto firstly issued a point-to-point cash system
and its infrastructure protocol: Bitcoin: an Electronic Cash in the Point-to-Point
Internet. This digital currency, called “Bitcoin”, can help two transaction parties to
build up the bridge of trust to guarantee the completion of the transaction based on
intelligent codes without relying on the verification from a third party intermediary.
After more than 10 years of development, the blockchain technology behind bitcoin is
gradually understood by more and more people, and has undergone continuous
development and innovation.

Blockchain's role in trust is like that of internet in information. What is mostly absent
in internet is the Trust Protocol used to confirm the validity and authenticity of every
transaction. The blockchain technology can provide bases to solve such problems,
optimizing the approaches and methods adopted by people to allow people to deal
with trust, security and privacy.

Hence, based on its capability to promote transparency and to protect privacy,
blockchain connecting Trust, the most profound need for human beings, point the
road ahead for a fairer, more efficient and more accessible global financial
Blockchain business application pioneer

system. The blockchain technology has huge potential, which will bring about great
changes for traditional manufacturing, financial sector, government bodies and all
human beings.

Features and benefits of the blockchain technology: a brand new distributed
infrastructure architecture and calculation paradigm is established thanks to the block
chain digital structure used for data verification and storage, data generation and
updating based on the consensus algorithm of the distributed computer node, data
transmission and access security guaranteed by cryptography, as well as data
programming and operation based on smart contracts consisting of automatic script
codes. The blockchain technology will store records in thousands of, or even millions
of independent computers, while these computers can work in a coordinated manner,
no single entity can control them to alter data and software.

Moreover, the blockchain technology can establish the reliable point-to-point trust in
the internet, so the value transfer doesn't rely on the intermediary. Blockchain
discloses information yet protects privacy, makes collective decisions yet protects the
interest of the single entity, which increases the efficiency of value exchange and
reduces cost as well.

The blockchain technology has gradually become mature, bringing about the business
ecologic circle of generation, storage, transaction and application. In the industries
covered by the blockchain technology, banking, securities and insurance have gained
the biggest share. In the future, the entertainment and media industries powered by the
blockchain technology will develop in an accelerating speed, and other industries
including medical treatment, internet of things, and supply chain will also see more
and more applications of the technology.

WaykiChain is committed to the booming development of all industries. Based on the
incorporation of the benefits of both bitcoin and ethereum, WaykiChain has built up
the enterprise-level blockchain infrastructure by integrating the on-chain and off-chain
of the blockchain, and thus formed the third generation blockchain eco-system. In the
financial and entertainment sectors, WaykiChain will use the blockchain technology
to redefine the traditional concepts including assets, currency, investment and
transaction, solving the difficulties of exchange, transaction and transmission of
values on the internet such as funds, contracts and digitalized assets, etc. Natural
persons and financial organizations can, through the eco-system established by
WaykiChain, realize the on-line value transmission and exchange in a highly trusted
manner by using the whole set of decentralized mechanism constructed by the
blockchain technology.

1.2 Design principles and meanings of WaykiChain

Although there are many blockchain platforms in the market, and new platforms are
Blockchain business application pioneer

emerging every day. It is rare to see the platform that not only incorporates with the
traditional business but also applies in reality, and the terminal application
incorporated with the blockchain technology hardly exists. Even bitcoin, which is the
earliest one applies in reality, has more collection value than its currency value. Such
situations have more or less deviated from the final objective given to the blockchain
technology to change the society, or even to subvert the current business model.

We hope to build up a brand new blockchain Eco-system which will be an option for
the internet value transmission protocol in the future and to promote the usability and
operability of the whole blockchain industry. This is WaykiChain.

Thanks to its leading blockchain technology, WaykiChain will, based on its clear
business positioning and strategic plans, firstly permeate into and gain shares of the
target markets, such as the betting, assets transaction and foreign currency exchange,
etc. After accumulating users' solid support, WaykiChain will gradually develop a
blockchain technology platform incorporated with real business applications.

Part II WaykiChain technological solutions

2.1 Smart contract

WaykiChain is a smart contract platform that supports Turing devices. It adopts
DPOS consensus mechanism, sets up 11 voting nodes, and generates a new block
every 10 seconds. According to detailed calculation by WaykiChain Team, currently
the confirmed transaction speed can reach 1000+tps. WaykiChain’s smart contracts
are compiled with lua scripts. Lua was innovated in Brazil in 1993. After 30 years of
development, lua is widely used in various kinds of fields, such as games, internet of
things and built-in devices, etc. It is easy to learn and use by community developers
because of its detailed development materials, and thus enjoys global support from
developers and enterprises. With only a small number of WaykiChain coins,
community developers can publish their lua smart contracts into WaykiChain’s
decentralized blockchain networks. And thanks to smart contracts, we can realize a
plenty of applications scenarios, such as assets issue, bet application, copyright
sourcing, mutual insurance, decentralized exchange markets and cross-border
settlement, etc.

2.2 Voting mechanism

WaykiChain adopts DPOS consensus mechanism with 11 accounting nodes. When
each block is generated, each accounting node is elected according to the random
perturbation algorithm from the 11 nodes with the most votes. Then the accounting
node gains all of the transaction handling fee in its accounting block. If the user locks
his WaykiChain coins, he may earn the related interests. When the votes of the
corresponding user account change, the interest will automatically accrue. According
to the design of the system, the annual rate of return is 5% for the first year, and the
rate of return will decrease by 1% every year, and finally, the annual rate of return will
be fixed at 1% permanently.

2.3 WaykiChain applications

WaykiChain decentralized betting application is the first smart contract released by
WaykiChain Team. In the application, the built-in application betting super-coin will
be published. Every term of betting will be triggered by the initiator through the smart
contract transaction. During the valid period stimulated by the contract, the user may
initiate the betting contract transaction, and all of the transactions can be searched and
traced in the block browser, and can never be revised. All of the super-coins in the
betting will be frozen in the smart contract. When a certain term of betting is over, the
bet initiator will publish final betting results through the contract
Blockchain business application pioneer

transaction. Then the smart contract will issue awards to the correct bettor based on
final results from official authorities .

WaykiChain’s decentralized assets exchange market is another smart contract
application released by the WaykiChain Team. Users are allowed to exchange their
real assets into their Wayki assets in the form of mortgage, and trade them openly in
the market. The smart contract provided by WaykiChain allows the assets initiator to
compile dividend sharing rules triggered by certain conditions. And all of the market
behaviors towards the object in the transaction will decide the final price of the assets
in circulation.

Users needing foreign currency may also realize cross-border remittance, transaction
and payment through WaykiChain. The foreign currency exchange initiator may
possess Wayki coins by means of pledging his assets to WaykiChain, and earn profit
by the rate of exchange. Users needing foreign currency can directly look for
recipients in WaykiChain. WaykiChain forex platform, based on the blockchain
technology, features high vertical efficiency that exceeds traditional means. Thus
more and more recipients will be lured into the business opportunities to meet their
increasing demands for foreign currency exchange transactions.

2.4 Sidechain

The hottest platform which supports smart contracts, Ethereum, has received much
recognition in the market. However, there is still huge potential improvement for
Ethereum, which could be seen from the recent network congestion. In the history,
Ethereum had been stuck from network congestion or hacked frequently. WaykiChain
would apply its own sidechain technology, which allows the applications based on
WaykiChain to have its own sidechain. Sidechains are mutually exclusive and are able
to set up its own consensus. Sidechain will be required to download specific blocks
when using the sidechain application. Therefore, it will enhance the efficiency and
reduces the resources waste. Sidechain will transfer and receive information from the
main chain to ensure the information security by registering its hash on main chain.

2.5 Whole node wallet

WaykiChain Team will publish Windows version whole node wallet in its first
WaykiChain application, named WaykiChain Betting. The wallet will be integrated
with the money transfer function for Wayki coins and super betting coins as well as
the bet application center. Within the wallet application center, the user can directly
publish the betting smart contract to participate in the betting. The betting bonus will
be
Blockchain business application pioneer

automatically issued to the user’s wallet after the betting results are released.
2.6 Mobile terminal

WaykiChain is estimated to publish Wayki android and IOS applications in 2018.
Mobile terminal applications will be integrated with Wayki coin light wallet. The user
can store Wayki coins and super-coin digital assets in the local mobile terminal and
can participate in betting games conveniently. All of the betting bonus will be
automatically issued to the user’s mobile application after the betting is over.

2.7 Block browser

Block browser is a WaykiChain application data display system that displays money
transfer records of Wayki coins and super-coins, balance of the address account,
betting transactions and drawing results, etc. According to the application data in
blockchai, all of the data is open, transparent and irreversible by nature.

Part III Application outlook and realization scenarios in WaykiChain industry

3.1 Global decentralized betting application

3.1.1 Pain points of global betting industry

(1) Credit of traditional betting platforms

When all the online betting platforms adopt the centralized business model (i.e. run by
a certain organization or firm), all the participants in the game must have their assets
managed by those centralized platforms. The truth is that the credibility and
qualification of many online platforms are worrisome to say the least. Problems such
as technical loopholes, black box operation, illegal collection, money pool setup,
platform scam, non-real-name verification, information insecurity and lack of legal
protection bring grave risk to the participants.

From technical perspective, after examining five major security tests, including code
security, data storage security, data transmission security, network port security, and
multilateral interacting process security, we concluded that most of the online betting
Applications and clients showed symptoms of encryption algorithm misuse,
encryption protocol’s incorrect implementation or partial missing. They are also
scored poorly in areas such as user trading information protection, user deposit
protection, preventing transaction history tempering and user identity theft, etc. As a
result, hackers are given plenty of opportunities to play their tricks in this process.

If one looks closely at these online platforms, he or she will soon find out that most of
them share the burden of poor credit. Various platforms that involved in the betting
business ended up pulling a string on their users and running away. These online
betting platforms do not own enough capital to hedge their risk and would therefore
be dissolved the second when they encounter any major loss. Some platforms would
choose to scam their users to invest even before they had any loss. Besides, black box
operations such as embezzlement, underground lottery, fraud, lack of transparency in
the rule put a thorn in the heart of all the players.

(2) Limitation of market supervision

The authorities in different countries have different attitudes towards the betting
industry. Some countries regard betting as financial activities, while some regard it as
gambling. Betting activities are treated with strict and tedious supervision, which has

substantially limited their development and innovation capabilities.

(3) High percentage of commission fee collected by traditional betting platforms

11
Blockchain business application pioneer

Operators of centralized betting platforms require high return to offset their risks,
because centralized betting activities or the events themselves mean high risks. So the
participants in the betting activities are forced to bear some of the cost of the
operators. The legal compliance fees collected by the supervision authorities as
mentioned above also covertly reduce the return which should be enjoyed by users.
Now the total rate of return in the sports contest betting in China is usually around
70% . Some illegal platform can provide 80%-90% rate of return. However, this is far
from enough in the market. According to probability theory, nobody can win in the
long term in such a distorted market.

(4) Niche betting market

Traditional betting activities are supervised by the government, which has resulted in
the situation where most betting platforms are hidden in the underground market. The
outside world knows little about the platforms, and so the market need is not met
effectively. Therefore, the seller, or the operator of the betting platform, has more
leverage on price, which further squeezes the return of investors. On the other hand,
providers of betting activities, due to their covert characteristics, are more difficult to
gain the trust of users, because users feel very difficult to verify the qualifications of
the providers in the covert market, or such providers intrinsically bear risks of trust
breach. Hence the participants of the betting activities are further discouraged, and
new users are blocked from the market.

(5) Lack of diversity in traditional platforms

In the traditional business model of the centralized betting platform, the operator, as
the opponent to participants, will bet in the opposite way. The operator can only make
profits when participants make wrong judgments. Therefore, most traditional betting
platforms have established their own risk control systems and product research
departments. If the betting rules of a certain event will give participants some
advantages, then definitely such betting event will not be adopted and published by
the operator. A philosophical question is raised: only the products and events which
are regarded by the operator as advantageous can be published in the platform, while
those events published to participants are proved to be advantageous for the operator.
Therefore, in the market, there is only a limited number of events available to betting
participants. In most cases, such events are disadvantageous for participants.

3.1.2 Business solutions for decentralized betting games

The decentralized betting application built on the WaykiChain system has inherited
the features and benefits of the blockchain technology, so it will perfectly solve the

12
Blockchain business application pioneer

unreasonable problems in the current betting industry, including the low rate of return
on the traditional betting platform which is badly criticized, shortage of available
betting products, and non-openness, non-transparency, legal risks, fund insecurity,
and cheating of the operator, etc.

Because the betting application built on WaykiChain is decentralized, it will not be
controlled by any party of interest. Moreover, the betting information is recorded in
the distributed ledger and cannot be altered by any party, so false betting results are
impossible.

All users can check the real-time betting records through the blockchain browser. Any
fraud or other illegal malicious behaviors will be found out and prevented in time. For
example, in the soccer betting, the WaykiChain application will refer to the officially
published match results or to those trustworthy results accepted by the public and will
collect and verify real-time data. All users will get a result recognized in consensus,
then WaykiChain smart contract will execute gains distribution according to the
automatically calculated betting rate of return.

Because the execution of the smart contract is preset, and the betting information of
all users are recorded and cannot be altered in blockchain, so all users enjoy a just,
open, and fair gaming environment. The blockchain technology itself has become the
most powerful credit endorsement for the betting application.

Comparing with the traditional betting platform, the betting application built on
WaykiChain features another big advantage: operational cost. WaykiChain is jointly
operated by whole nodes and users, so no organization like the traditional operator
will share the interest that is payable to the betting participant. The rate of return in
WaykiChain betting application may reach 99%, which no other competitors in the
market can do so. Therefore, the blockchain technology can bring about another big
competitive advantage, namely, the participant can gain the highest rate of return in
WaykiChain betting application.

Any individual who is very confident about a certain event can also publish a betting
activity freely towards such event. WaykiChain betting application allows all
participants to publish their own event betting. A publisher, by using the smart
contract provided by WaykiChain, can write his event in which he trusts into
WaykiChain, and places his assets limits which he pledges in WaykiChain as the
betting return. Any user who is interested in and has opposite opinions towards the
event can participate in the betting. And the rate of return is decided by the ratio of
investment fund of all the participants in the final event result. The smart contract will
help strangers to solve the biggest trust obstacle, and at the same time, it will not cost
much as the third witness party.

Besides, the betting application built on WaykiChain can almost
evade legal
Blockchain business application pioneer

supervision. Firstly, participants will use the digital currency issued by WaykiChain,
(not legal currency). Secondly, like bitcoin, WaykiChain is distributed in many nodes
in the world, which can neither be destroyed nor be caught. Finally, the anonymity
brought by blockchain can help users to carry out games in a safer manner.

More importantly, thanks to the decentralization in WaykiChain betting application,
there is no control of the rate of return or market manipulation on the part of the
dealer, and thus no dealer's runaways. Users in WaykiChain betting application is
worry free completely.

The WaykiChain application will be gradually open and provide all the betting
products and games available in the market. In the early stage, the sports contest
betting is used as the beginning point to lure and accumulate initial users. Laterr, it
will be open for all users to create their own independent event bets. As time passes
by, it will become a killer-level unprecedented betting application on internet thanks
to its comprehensive betting products and highest rate of return.

3.2 Global decentralized assets transaction application

3.2.1 Pain points in the global centralized assets exchange

The traditional security market is developed around the exchange. The transaction
system in the exchange guarantees the normal procedures of all transactions. Once the
system is attacked or doesn't work, the whole network may be compromised, and all
transactions must be halted. When the centralized assets exchange suffers loss
because of outside malicious attacks, all users on the platform normally suffer.
Famous examples include Mt. Gox, MF Global, and Bitfinex exchanges. Users must
bear the loss when the exchange is attacked by hackers or the exchange goes bankrupt;
in some extreme cases, there are embezzlements in the exchange.

By selecting the centralized assets exchange, users must trust it completely, giving out
their assets for keeping without any doubts. This means that the assets disposition
right is transferred from the proprietor to the trustee, ie. the centralized assets
exchange. Therefore, the exchange not only is entitled to dispose your assets, but also
sees all of your transactions. No one can guarantee that the exchange will not execute
the transaction to its benefits, and as a matter of fact, many exchanges have been done
so. Moreover, every exchange has many employees, which increases the difficulty of
internal supervision.

(2) Unfairness of the centralized assets exchange

Because users' transaction information is visible in the exchange, the scandals of
insider trading in major exchanges can be seen frequently. Besides, the

14
Blockchain business application pioneer

transaction speed is not very fast in the exchange. If some traders can always execute
their transactions more quickly, they can gain benefits by means of computing
advantages and transaction proceeding speed, which is called high frequency
transaction. This is very unfair to other traders. And to compete for faster transaction
speed requires more investment, hence increasing the costs of transaction.

(3) Rules limits in the centralized assets exchange

In the traditional centralized assets exchange, such as NASDAQ, and in the emerging
digital currency exchange, such as Coinbase, users are required to follow the rules as
stipulated by the exchange, including limited trading time, quota of cash withdrawn
every day and even the proof of user's assets income as required by some exchange.

Moreover, the assets products that can be traded in the traditional exchange are
limited too. The traded assets registered with the exchange must pass various kinds of
inspections and supervisions, which causes legal compliance costs and time cost as
well. Many quality assets are thus refused to be traded by the assets market.

(4) Time cost and high transaction fee caused by the centralized assets exchange

The foreground system in the exchange is responsible for matching transactions,
while the background system is responsible for settlement and delivery. There are
many procedures and links in the two systems, which leads to time and fund cost.
Moreover, according to rules, real time settlement cannot be made on the date of
transaction, which also brings about potential risks to assets.

Furthermore, the operational and promotional fees in the exchange are expensive, and
such fees will be labeled as handling fees from users' transactions. Take the digital
currency trading website Bitstamp as an example, a user must pay USD 5 for every
transaction worth USD 1000. However, the handling fees of Bitstamp are not the most
expensive among digital assets exchanges.

3.2.2 Business solutions of decentralized assets transactions

The blockchain technology helps to realize the concept of the decentralized assets
exchange.

The decentralized assets exchange built on WaykiChain system will inherit all the
functions in the traditional centralized assets exchange, such as stock trading, rare
metal trading, commodity trading, etc. The decentralized exchange can not only bear
the load of the same or even bigger trading volume comparing to the centralized
exchange, but also solve the pain points that are common in the centralized one.

15
Blockchain business application pioneer

Decentralization of WaykiChain technology means that no stakeholder groups or
organizations can control the decentralized exchange, thus keeping its fairness,
openness and transparency. At the same time, users don't have to worry about the
credit of the exchange, because the object of trust has changed from the traditional
centralized organization to blockchain smart contract. In WaykiChain decentralized
assets exchange, all transactions are realized through smart contracts, without the
existence of any fraud or malicious breaking promises. Therefore, the blockchain
technology and smart contract can provide more effective support for the transaction
of digital assets products, hence laying the foundation for providing transactions of
digital assets.

WaykiChain decentralized assets exchange empowers users so that they don't have to
worry about the high time and handling cost in the traditional centralized assets
exchange. The blockchain technology can simplify and automate the profound trading
procedures, so that the assets publisher and investor can trade with each other directly,
reducing interactions between the foreground and background and save a lot of
manpower and material sources. Moreover, the limits often seen in the traditional
exchange exist no more in the decentralized exchange. Users can trade at any time
freely. Cash withdrawal is not limited, every user has full power to dispose his
properties.

Thanks to the consensus algorithm and its irreversibility nature of the distributed
blockchain technology adopted by WaykiChain decentralized assets exchange,
WaykiChain decentralized assets exchange helps the participants to trade assets to
perfectly shared data. Every user’s transaction is recorded in the block browser and
cannot be altered. Meanwhile, the exchange allows anonymous transaction. Users
don't have to worry either the spying upon their transaction information or the dealer's
counterpart transactions due to information advantages.

Any user can pledge his assets in WaykiChain decentralized assets exchange,
publishing his own WaykiChain assets. For example, John owns a company with an
annual profit of USD 1 million, and his estimated value of his company is USD 10
million. However, due to various kinds of limits from the stock exchange and
supervision authority, John is not able to list his company by issuing stock shares to
the public. Now, John may choose to issue his WaykiChain shares on WaykiChain
decentralized assets exchange.

John's WaykiChain shares are granted with value because he has pledged the future
income and some proprietary rights of his company in the smart contract of
WaykiChain decentralized assets exchange. Every year, based on the share ratio of
the investors, the profits of the company will be automatically allocated, and the
investors also enjoy the shareholders’ right in the company. Thanks to the smart
contract of the blockchain technology, the cost to establish trust is reduced drastically
in the transaction.

16
Blockchain business application pioneer

WaykiChain decentralized assets exchange allows the user to pledge any assets to
issue the corresponding WaykiChain assets. The price of such assets will be
recognized by investors according to market laws.

3.3 Settlement time of international remittance and forex

3.3.1 Pain points of global cross-border remittance and forex

(1) Settlement time of international remittance and forex

In the cross-border transaction, if the remitter and payee doesn't belong to the same
bank, the procedures necessary for the transaction is very tedious. Different banks
have different ledgers. When the cross-border transfer is executed, banks involved
have to check their own ledgers, and the transaction can only be fulfilled after
information is exchanged and verified by every bank. Then comes the breach risk
when both parties make the settlement.

Therefore, the common solution is to seek the third party as an escrow account; and
only when the transaction is completed, the third party will transfer the fund into the
account of the payee. Tedious account verification will slow the transaction speed.
Particularly when the cross-border transaction happens, more than one bank are
involved if the respective bank for the remitter and payee intend to complete the
transaction. The time necessary in such procedures is unpredictable. Sometimes, the
transaction can finish in one day, and sometimes it will take several days.

In the forex market, following ordinary procedure, one trading party transfers its fund
to the intermediary. For example, CLS, a foreign currency settlement provider, will
hold the fund till the counterpart party provides its fund. One problem occurs in the
procedure is that, before the settlement is completed, the fund of the initiating party
will be frozen in the transaction for one day normally, or even longer. Therefore, the
forex market as well as the cross-border transfer faces the same problem, i.e.,
uncertainty and delay of the transaction completion time.

(2) Exchange rate risk in the cross-border remittance market

The parties involved in the cross-border remittance and forex must face the risk of
exchange rate fluctuations due to the time delay of the transaction. Usually, the parties
involved are required by banks to bear the rate fluctuation risk when they use the
inter-bank transfer service, which increases uncertainty of transaction for both parties.
The risk of rate fluctuations can be particularly fatal for forex parties.

(3) Fees in the cross-border remittance market

In the market, every participant involved in remittance will be charged with certain
fees. And the more the money involved, the higher the relevant fees are. Hence
another uncertainty occurs, because the total fees for one transaction cannot be
determined until the completion of the transaction. Generally, the fees for one
transaction is 2% - 3% of the traded amount; in some extreme cases, the fees may
exceed 10%.

(4) Non-transparency in the cross-border remittance market

As mentioned above, neither the remitter nor the payee is sure about the necessary
time and fees for the transaction, They only know that the fee collected will be
fluctuated within a range. Moreover, as the initiators of the transaction, both the
remitter and payee can neither search for the trading progress in the trading banks, nor
can they carry out effective real-time tracing. Because every transaction is usually
fulfilled by many different participants, it is extremely difficult to search and trace the
relevant information.

When a mistake occurs beyond expectations, it is very difficult to locate the mistake
by tracing the transaction. Mistakes will usually be found out after quite a time. For
example, wrong account numbers takes even longer time to fix.

(5) Forex settlement risk

Settlement is a major forex link. The global forex settlement systems are innovated
thanks to the development of the information technology. Because financial systems
are inter-connected, a settlement failure in a large amount of transaction will trigger a
series of breaches. The risk is that the cross-border settlement can only be executed
during the normal working time of the central bank of the home currency. While both
parties in the settlement may reside in different time zones, if one party makes the
settlement before the other party, the other party waiting for the settlement will face
its counterpart breaches.

If a forex trader pays its currency but doesn't get the currency payable, it will face the
loss coming from the rate fluctuations of the exact currency payable. The risk comes
from the synchronization of the payments by both parties.

(6) Supervision requirements in the cross-border remittance and forex

Every state puts much emphasis on the supervision of foreign currency and cross-

border transactions. It is also very difficult to increase the supervision efficiency and
lower the cost as well.

3.3.2 Decentralized forex business solution

Along with the development of WaykiChain, there would be more and more users
joining WaykiChain. Some of them speak different languages and use different
currencies. To make all users to participate in the WaykiChain conveniently,
WaykiChain has provided a solution that different legal currencies can be converted.
At the same time, the system will serve the users who need forex transactions and
cross-border remittance.

In WaykiChain decentralized forex application, there will be forex recipient for
various legal currencies. Anyone can become an recipient. Recipient can obtain the
digital assets titles (WKX) by pledging assets to WaykiChain, such as bitcoins, Wayki
coins, Ethereum, etc. WKX can be WKCNY, WKUSD, or WKBTC. WKX to the
corresponding legal currency is anchored at the forex rate of 1:1. In WaykiChain,
users can either pay WKX to buy the assets priced with the corresponding legal
currency, or withdraw cash with WKX, which has provided a channel for fund
circulation. WKX supplies will be strictly recorded in the blockchain browser where
anybody can access. WaykiChain will increase WKX circulations with the same
amount as that of the corresponding pledged deposit, and will recover the
corresponding WKX in case of cash withdrawal.

For example, investor John owns RMB 60,000, and intends to convert the money into
USD. But due to the forex control in the country, John chooses to use WaykiChain to
exchange for USD. In WaykiChain decentralized forex application, John finds
recipient Terrence who wants to exchange for RMB with his USD, and then sends
RMB 60,000 to Terrence. After that, John gets WKUSD at the same exchange rate as
that of USD. Suppose the exchange rate of USD to RMB is 1:6, John gets 10,000
WKUSD. At the same time, the title of 10,000 WKUSD is taken back by the system
from recipient Terrence. By continuing to pledge the deposit to WaykiChain,
Terrence can gain more WKX< titles to provide acceptance services.

The smart contract supported by WaykiChain will ensure the trasaction’s immediacy
and security. Foreign exchange transaction and trade will become much faster and
become more convenient for customers. Moreover, the transaction cost would be
reduced as well.

Unlike the traditional forex platforms, WaykiChain doesn't charge any handling fees.
The recipient can select his own forex rate and the range of fluctuations. Finally, the
actual rate will be close to the officially published rate, because the listed rate
exceeding the market rate will be eliminated by the market.

WaykiChain contracts guarantees the instantaneity and security of every transaction,
because the exchange and cross-border remittance between the currencies of different
countries become very fast and convenient in the system. At the same time, the
necessary cost is reduced to minimum.

3.4 Construction of the blockchain Eco-system

WaykiChain provides highly usable and expandable infrastructure platforms for
blockchain applications. It is open to all of the developers. Anyone can publish his
applications on WaykiChain, realizing his business ideas.

In the early stage, WaykiChain will focus on three major applications in order to
expand the market, namely, the decentralized betting application, decentralized assets
transaction application and the decentralized forex application. After that, it will
gradually increase and perfect the upper-layer blockchain applications.

Besides the development of user's terminals, WaykiChain system will provide the
development platforms fit for different systems and users. At the same time,
WaykiChain Team will continue to develop and provide mobile terminal services,
including the mobile wallet and the mobile smart contract application. We believe that
the true realization of the blockchain mobile terminal services can not only change
current APP markets and business models, but also benefit a wider population of
internet users. In this way, the blockchain technology can be promoted and developed
in China.

Part V WaykiChain's planning and vision

5.1 Purpose and management of Waykicoins

24
Blockchain business application pioneer

5.1.1 Purpose of Waykicoins

Waykicoins are the tokens consumed in WaykiChain operation. WaykiChain users
can use WaykiChain applications and functions by consuming their WaykiChaincoin.
For better understanding, the coins can be compared to a kind of fuel.

The maximum amount of WaykiChaincoin is 210 million pieces, which will be
generated when WaykiChaincoins is official published. All of the coins will be held
by the WaykiChain Foundation and is available for sale in public fund-raising. The
time and rules for public sales will be released on WaykiChain official website.

The minimum trading unit of WaykiChaincoins is to eight decimal places. As
WaykiChaincoins adopts DPOS stock authorization certification mechanism, the
holder of WaykiChaincoins can gain 5% interest, and the rate of interests will be
attenuated annually till 1%. For example, 100 WaykiChaincoins will be increased to
105 coins in the second year. Every piece of WaykiChaincoin corresponds to a voting
right, and the holder can take part in the election of book-keepers (self-
recommendation allowed).

5.1.2 Attributes statements of Waykicoins

WaykiChaincoins are only tokens used and circulated in the wallet of the WaykiChain
application, so there are no attributes of legal currency in the coins, just like the
tickets of a music fair can only be used for the entry of the fair.

After release, WaykiChaincoins can be obtained through mining, voting, subscription,
or transactions with other holders, which means that WaykiChaincoins have value of
transactions by possible trading with other currencies in other exchanges. However,
this doesn't mean that WaykiChaincoins themselves have attributes and value
characteristic of legal currencies.

5.1.3 Allocation plan for WaykiChaincoins

© 60% for public sales

To guarantee sufficient liquidity to start the application in the early stage and the
equality and credibility of all participants, 60% of WaykiChaincoins tokens will be
released in the market for private fund-raising. The fund from the public sales

of WaykiChaincoins will be kept by WaykiChain Foundation, and will be used to pay
for the operational fees of WaykiChain relating to product development, technological
upgrading, marketing, financing, legal consultation and community encouragement,
etc. The foundation is obliged to disclose to the public the usage and details of the
funds on regular basis.

e 15% reserved for the development team, early investors and operational team

25
Blockchain business application pioneer

They have made contributions in the early development of WaykiChaincoins, by
providing manpower, materials, resources and technology, etc. A part of the coins are
reserved for them to pay for their contributions.

At the same time, some coins will be reserved to encourage the sustainable
development and maintenance of the team. Such coins are configured with a frozen
period, so that holders cannot sell them before the time line.

e 10% for private investor

This percentage of WaykiChaincoins is reserved for thoses investors who invested
WaykiChain early as rewards for taking the highest risk.

e 15% for development reserve

The development reserve will be used as rewards for individuals or groups that make
major contributions to WaykiChain in the future. It will be used as merger funds to
incorporate the ideal target in order to expand the market share if necessary. The
reserve will be kept by the foundation, and its details of use will be disclosed to the
public regularly.

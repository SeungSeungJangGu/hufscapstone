Abstract

Green is commonly used to represent growth, health and sustainability.
GreenPower is a hybrid cryptocurrency that encompasses all of these
qualities. GreenPower has been designed to reach mainstream levels of global
growth, has been structured to maintain optimal systemic health and has
been built to deliver long-term operational sustainability. The focus of
GreenPower is on achieving unprecedented levels of utility, liquidity and
efficiency within the realm of blockchain technology. GreenPower serves the
global marketplace as the featured rewards currency in a universal customer
loyalty program hosted by merchants throughout the world.

GreenPower was developed on world-class blockchain technology (Graphene)
and features a unique hybrid consensus mechanism and a highly-efficient
consortium-based network configuration. The resulting mutual distributed
ledger system, known as the Powerchain, confirms transactions in just three
seconds and has the capacity to process over 100,000 transactions per second.
GreenPower has a fixed supply of coins that were fully distributed during the
past two years to approximately 150,000 account holders in over 180 countries,
all of whom received their coins only after having verifiably contributed time
and considerable value to the system.

At its core, GreenPower is a hybrid cryptocurrency that combines the best
qualities of decentralized systems with the strongest elements of centralized
systems while eliminating their respective weaknesses. The unique structure
of GreenPower gives it strategic advantages over its competitors that can
deliver superior levels of utility, liquidity and efficiency.

Introduction
GreenPower has been designed to answer three important questions:
1) How will the global mainstream adopt blockchain technology?

2) How cana cryptocurrency achieve optimal levels of systemic
health?

3) How to create a blockchain with enduring operational efficiency?

The starting point for developing answers to these questions was a digital
currency that successfully delivered superior performance through greater
operational efficiency, increased transaction capacity, wider distribution,
better governance and enhanced regulatory compliances. GreenPower was
created from a hard fork of that system (DasCoin 2.0), which in turn had been
created from a hard fork of BitShares 2.0 using the Graphene Toolkit.

GreenPower is a convertible “store-of-value” unit at the center of a global

digital asset system. This system was developed and launched without an
initial coin offering (ICO) and without outside investment capital, and has
been operating successfully for nearly three years.

GreenPower is at the center of an ecosystem of companies (the Green
Ecosystem), each of which works synergistically to enhance the overall value
of the system for its participants. The system seeks to redefine how incentives
can be used in the emerging economy as well as improve the quality and
efficiency of the exchange of value between individuals, businesses, financial
institutions, cooperatives, and merchants. Propelled by the power of its hybrid
structure and benefitting from its streamlined operational model,
GreenPower is well positioned to become the world’s first mainstream digital

currency.

Architecture

Blockchain

The foundational technology on which GreenPower has been created is called
BitShares. The BitShares Blockchain makes use of a lesser-known consensus
mechanism called Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) that was developed
specifically to replace the wasteful “mining” process, increase throughput and
reduce reaction times of the blockchain. It also offers tremendous reductions

in the consumption of electricity.

Graphene is a software platform designed for deploying third-generation
cryptographically-secure decentralized ledgers, also known as “blockchains”.
Graphene is a toolkit for real-time blockchains. Graphene-based systems have
orders-of-magnitude better performance than first-generation
Bitcoin-derived systems or even the second-generation “Bitcoin 2.0” systems
that constitute its current closest competitors. Graphene-based systems are
ideally suited for transaction-intensive use cases and offer a broad range of
built-in features and services distinguished by their transparency and intrinsic
incorruptibility.
vid June 14th 2019

Graphene

Graphene is a prominent blockchain technology that works in a more
effective way of transmitting blocks efficiently across the network. It uses
bloom filters like compact blocks which consist transmitting transaction IDs
of the selective blocks and all these emerging technologies are using bloom
filters to perform a quick and rapid transaction. Bloom filter is a compact way
of determining data for example, ‘ABC’ is a transaction having larger data but
the requirement is of ‘B’ only then Mempool efficiently select ‘B’ and transmit
it through the network. Graphene proficiently reduces the size of data
transaction and is far superior for a thin block and the core’s compact blocks
as well. Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) is a known method that achieves the
high transactions-per-second capacity by using short block time, and it is
beneficial for those who make the block and have a smaller subset of block
creator.

Consensus

Bitcoin and Ethereum are based on a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus
mechanism, where all the nodes can participate in the competition of adding
blocks to the blockchain. The POW mechanism seems completely
decentralized on paper, but in reality, with increasing load on the system - it
outgrows the computational power needed to mine these blocks. At a certain
point, it becomes nearly impossible for a person with a desktop computer to
add any value to the system. In such scenarios, only huge mining rigs and
pools are able to mine and add blocks.

PoW-based blockchains are facing a major backlash, due to the amount of
power being used in the mining process. The Bitcoin network alone
consumes more electricity than 159 individual countries. With these
drawbacks, there was always a growing need for less power-hungry and more
decentralized consensus mechanism. This is what led to the creation of DPoS.

Blockchain Elements

Reaching Consensus

Consensus mechanisms are protocols that make sure all nodes (servers in the
network that maintain the blockchain and sometimes process transactions)
are synchronized with each other and agree on which transactions are
legitimate and should be added to the blockchain.

By providing the system with a reliable way to reach decisions, consensus
mechanisms enable a blockchain to function properly. Multiple nodes can
submit transactions to be added to the blockchain, so it’s necessary that all
transactions are constantly checked and that the blockchain is constantly
audited and this is most efficiently accomplished by the nodes themselves.
Without a solid consensus mechanism, the blockchains are at risk of various
attacks.

Following are popular consensus mechanisms:

Proof-of-Work Consensus (PoW)

The Proof-of-Work process is Known as mining and the nodes are known as
miners. Miners solve complex mathematical puzzles which require a lot of
computational power. The first one to solve the puzzle gets to create a block
and receives a reward for creating a block. These mathematical puzzles have
some interesting properties. This process ensures that in order to create a
block, one will need a lot of computational power to solve the puzzle first.

Miners can mine blocks using a range of different hardware:

e CPU Mining: Using a normal computer's CPU to validate transactions in
a proof of work consensus protocol.

e GPU Mining: This is not dissimilar to CPU mining however, in this case,
a graphics card is used. Graphics cards are more powerful whilst
relatively using less electricity.

e Mining Pools: To increase the likelihood of successfully mining a block
miners pool together their resources and shares potential rewards
depending on how much each miner contributes.

e Cloud Mining: Some miners rent out their processing power to other
miners for an allotted period of time.
vid June 14th 2019

e FPGA Mining: Otherwise known as “Field Programmable Gate Array
mining”, an FPGA is a circuit tailored for a specific computing task,
making them several times faster at mining than normal processors.

e ASIC Mining: This refers to an “Application-Specific Integrated Circuit”, a
circuit customized for a particular use. ASICs easily outperform CPUs,
GPUs and FPGAs in both speed and efficiency, they are generally used

for Bitcoin mining.

Limitation: There is a major drawback to this consensus mechanism.
Proof-of-Work uses a lot of resources and is said to be unsustainable in the
future, which is why some blockchains are moving to different consensus

mechanisms.

Proof-of-Stake Consensus (PoS)

Proof-of-Stake is based on the premise that those who own the majority of
coins in a network have a vested interest in keeping the network maintained
and the value of its coins high. It is a randomized process used to determine
who gets to produce the next block. Users can stake their tokens to become a
validator (which enables them to produce blocks). In most PoS systems, this
requires the user to lock their tokens up for a certain period of time. After
doing so, they are eligible to produce blocks. The process that decides who
gets to produce the next block takes a couple of factors into account, and
what these factors depend on the design of the blockchain, but in general, the
person with the largest stake has the highest chance to produce a block.
Another factor that can influence the likelihood of producing the next block is

the duration that the staked coins have been held.

Validators are also rewarded for their work, with the reward that validators
receive for creating the next block depending on the design of the blockchain.
Usually, they either receive all or part of the transaction fees of all the
transactions in the block they created, or they receive a fixed amount of coins

(generated through inflation).

Proof-of-Stake is not only much more energy efficient than Proof-of-Work
systems, but it also has another major distinction. In a Proof-of-Work system, a
miner may not own any of the coins they are mining, meaning they only seek
to maximize their profits without actually improving the network. Ina
Proof-of-Stake system, validators have a much bigger incentive to maintain
the network as they actually hold the coins of the blockchain on which they

are validating.
vid June 14th 2019

Delegated Proof-of-Stake Consensus (DPoS)

The Graphene blockchain is based on the Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)
consensus mechanism, where ‘N’ number of witnesses are selected via
continuous voting by stakeholders to produce blocks. This ‘N’ is an odd
number, only for those whose witnesses producing the blocks in their
respective time slots until the next maintenance interval. After the
maintenance interval, the algorithm chooses the next set of witnesses based
on the voting results.

It is important to understand that:
e Only stakeholders can participate in the voting process.
e One stakeholder can only vote for one witness.

Apart from witnesses, the stakeholders also elect delegates who have the
privilege of proposing changes to the network parameters. These changes
range from something as simple as transaction fees — to the number of
elected witnesses. A particular majority of delegates approve the proposed
changes; post this, a two-week period is given to the stakeholders, during
which, they may vote out the delegates and veto the proposed changes (note
that these network changes aren't very likely to be proposed). Thus, under
DPoS it is safe to assume that the administrative authority rests in the hands
of the users, just like a democracy. But unlike witnesses, the delegates are not
compensated for retaining their positions.

Proof-of-Authority Consensus (PoA)

Proof-of-Authority is a modified form of Proof-of-Stake where instead of stake
with monetary value, a validator’s identity performs the role of stake. In
PoA-based networks, transactions and blocks are validated by approved
nodes, usually known as validators. Validators run software allowing them to
put transactions in blocks. The process is automated and does not require the
validators to do active monitoring. However, it does require maintaining
authority node(s) without interruption. PoA requires whitelisting for node
communication from emerging nodes on an established network.

With PoA, individuals earn the right to become validators, so there is an
incentive to retain the position that they have gained. By attaching a
reputation to identity, validators are incentivized to uphold the transaction
process, as they do not wish to have their identities attached to a negative
vid June 14th 2019

reputation. Some consider this consensus mechanism to be more robust for

the following reasons:

e In PoS, the same size stake can be valued differently by different
participants. While a stake between two parties may be equivalent, this
does not take into account each party's total holdings, which means
that the incentives can be unbalanced.

e Meanwhile, PoW uses an enormous amount of computing power,
which, in itself lowers incentive. It is also vulnerable to attack, as a
potential attacker would only need to have 51% of the mining resources

(hash rate) to control a network, although this is not easy to achieve.

On the other hand, PoA only allows non-consecutive block approval from any
one validator, meaning that the risk of serious damage is centralized to

authority nodes.

POA is suited for both private networks and public networks where trust is
distributed. The PoA consensus algorithm leverages the value of identities,
which means that block validators are not staking coins but their own

reputation instead.

Hybrid Consensus Mechanism

Within Powerchain, the consensus is reached using a modified version of
Proof-of-Authority (PoA) that is facilitated through the Delegated
Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) mechanism that is native to Graphene. In the
Powerchain model, the licensing of Master Nodes acts as the authority
mechanism rather than the reputation of the validator. In the Powerchain
consensus mechanism, an array of licensed Master Nodes serve as both block
producers and validators. Each Master Node’s IP address is white-listed within
the system in order to enable it to communicate with the network and
participate in the random rotation of block production. When not writing an
individual block, Master Nodes validate each block produced. The entire block
production process is reinforced by the second group of licensed nodes. These
are called Ledger Nodes and they record each block produced, but do not
write or validate individual blocks. Each Ledger Node contains a complete
record of every transaction generated on the Powerchain.
vid June 14th 2019

Master Nodes and Ledger Nodes are operated by companies that are either
part of the Green Ecosystem or are participating exchanges that list
GreenPower and other digital assets derived from the Powerchain. The
incentive to maintain these nodes is the enhancement of the associated core
business models rather than participation in a systematic transaction fee
(which seems to be the more common incentive model for node

maintenance).

Initial Distribution

Distribution of initial units/coins is one of the most critical factors in setting
the foundation for the ultimate value of a cryptocurrency. However too often
within the blockchain industry, initial distribution has been either
underanalyzed or overlooked. Problems have been created within many
cryptocurrencies due to the dynamics of their initial distribution strategies.
Even successful cryptocurrencies have had serious issues to contend within
this realm. For example, it’s well known that 20% of Ripple’s XRP currency was
distributed from the beginning to founders and developers. While this seems
reasonable in the case of equity of a private startup company, when seen in
the context of currencies, it seems misaligned and disproportionate that 20%
of a global currency would be distributed from the start to insiders.

There are several basic but highly important questions to answer at the start
of every new coin offering:

e Who is receiving units?
e How many units are they receiving?
e Why are they receiving those units?

Every currency and token must answer these questions from the start, though
due to the self-interest of the controlling parties, rarely is this distribution
dilemma talked about publicly.

As a hard fork of DasCoin 2.0 and the supported store-of-value currency within
the Green Ecosystem, GreenPower inherited the initial coin distribution of
DasCoin. This was a highly unique coin distribution method since it featured a
time-intensive “minting” process as well as incorporated a factor of
risk/reward. In this minting model, participants contributed value into the
vid June 14th 2019

system and received a certain number of Cycles (a utility token) based on their
respective level of contribution.

Cycles were designed to serve two purposes:

e They could be exchanged within the system for blockchain services

e They could be converted into coins by submitting the Cycles into a
“minting” process.

To initiate the second option, Cycles would be submitted to a minting queue
(comprised of the submitted Cycles). Then every ten minutes, a certain
number of Cycles were converted or “minted” into a certain number of new
coins, and distributed directly to the vault of the party who submitted the
Cycles. The exact conversion factor (which was called “Frequency”) increased
every two weeks based on the amount of value that had been collectively
contributed to the system during the preceding two-week period. This
conversion factor was designed to correlate with the changing dynamics of
the inherent risk/reward relationship of the entire system. As more value was
contributed to the system, there would be more resources to build out the
ecosystem and its applications, and the overall risks were proportionately
lowered, thereby reducing the potential reward, which in the system was
represented by the issuance of “minting” of coins.

The conversion factor (Frequency) was the control mechanism within the
minting process, and because it went up every two weeks, it took increasingly
more Cycles (the value of which remained constant during this process) to
mint an identical amount of coins. The resulting dynamic rewarded the high
risk taken by the earliest adopters (when it took just 2.5 Cycles to mint one
coin and there were very few people who had contributed value to the
system) with proportionally more coins for the same amount of contributed
value versus those who contributed value during the last stage of growth of
the system (when 20 Cycles were required to mint one coin).

The minting process systematically introduced a risk/reward factor into initial
coin distribution. It was a unique solution that proved to be an effective
mechanism for initial coin distribution, as it resulted in the initial 3,.294,166,501
coins being distributed to approximately 150,000 accounts in over 180
countries. Each of these accounts contributed a minimum of €100 of value
(and as much as €25,000 in some cases) to the system. All coins in the system

were created through this minting process, and therefore there were no coins
vid June 14th 2019

distributed for free to anyone (including the ecosystem company founders
and the initial development team).

Company founders contributed value for their respective Cycles in the same
manner as other minting participants (in many cases they did benefit from
the lowest Frequency rate, though the risk at the time of their contributions
was at its highest level). Members of the development team made their
contributions in the form of the services they performed, and it’s important to
note that the value of those services was calibrated using the same scale as
the contributions made by standard participants (not using a raw number of
coins or a percentage of the entire coin base). This is a major difference when
compared to virtually every other cryptocurrency and token project. There
was no “percentage of coins” distributed to the founders and developers.
There were no freebies, no air drops, and no gifts. Very simply stated, there
were no free coins ever distributed within the system. All participants first
contributed a standardized-calibrated amount of value to secure Cycles and
then submitted those Cycles to the minting process, which generally took
about three months from the date of submission to the minting of coins over
the course of the two years that the minting process was in place.

After two soft forks (that occurred prior to the hard fork of DasCoin v2.0 that
resulted in GreenPower), the minting process was permanently terminated.
Consequently, the supply of GreenPower is fixed at 3,294,166,501 and all these
coins have been distributed. Ecosystem company founders have set aside one
vault address to fortify the long-term operation of the ecosystem. Apart from
this address (1.2.27), which can be tracked on GRNexplorer.io and contains
coins that are held in the trust for the ecosystem, all other GreenPower coins
are in circulation.

System Elements

Transactions

When users want to interact with any blockchain, they construct so-called
transactions and transmit to the network. These present messages contain
instructions about what particular operation(s) a user wants to use. A
common operation is the simple transfer operation that comes with
transfer-specific instructions that provide the necessary information for this
action (such as the sender, receiver, the amount to transfer as well as an
optionally encrypted memo). To allow multiple operations to take place
subsequently, multiple operations can be bundled into a single transaction.
To identify within the system, transactions are cryptographically signed by the
users. These signatures authenticate a user and provide authorization for the
operations in the transaction.

Networking

A blockchain merely defines a means of storage and can be used ina
non-distributed, single-participant fashion as well as in a distributed
internet-based mesh network often referred to as Peer-2-Peer (P2P) network.
In the latter case, multiple parties are connected with each other in a way that
incoming transactions are forwarded to every other connected participant. A
transaction ultimately reaches a so-called block producer. A block producer
verifies incoming transactions against a hard-coded protocol and bundles
them into a single block that is added to the existing blockchain. At this point,
a transaction is considered confirmed and executed. The effects of an
executed operation on the current state are defined in the blockchain
protocol.

Performance and Scalability

The Powerchain is an extremely high-performance blockchain, confirming
transactions within three seconds and having the capacity to process
100,000+ transactions per second on a distributed network. Even higher levels
of performance achievable with relatively straightforward improvements to

server configuration and communication protocols.
The following are key points for high performance reflected in the system:
e Keep everything in memory.

e Keep the core business logic in a single thread.
vid June 14th 2019

e Keep cryptographic operations (hashes and signatures) out of the core

business logic.
e Divide validation into state-dependent and state-independent checks.
e Use an object-oriented data model.

Protocol

The Blockchain protocol is the most essential part of blockchain technologies.
It defines the behavior of the entire system including consequences and
side-effects when processing transactions. Users utilize particular features by
crafting a transaction that contains a particular letter-of-interest.

Blockchain only stores incremental changes (e.g. transactions). The final
balance of each account together with other information needs to be tracked
separately in the so- called “current state.” It is important to note that the
protocol is deterministic in the sense that the very same state is generated
when applying the same sequence of operations. This makes blockchain

technologies more secure and auditable.

System Principles

The Powerchain was developed with the following principles in mind:

Utility
The primary objective of the Powerchain system is utility. The system has

been designed to facilitate mainstream levels of utility through various

applications using the services of the system’s blockchain.

Rewards

Rather than compete solely as a direct payment solution, GreenPower can
also be used as a reward for customer loyalty and as an incentive to
encourage purchases at participating merchants. There are many problems
with the existing customer loyalty solutions. These programs can be valuable
but are scattered and lack standardization, making it very difficult for
consumers to track their progress and manage their rewards. The rewards of
one program are generally not honored by other programs, so it can be
difficult to redeem rewards from certain programs. The lack of interoperability
also makes it difficult to gauge the intrinsic value of the rewards. Consumers
vid June 14th 2019

also must contend with expirations and other control factors in the
redemption process.

There are also considerable problems with customer loyalty programs when
seen from the merchant perspective. First of all, it’s a competitive marketplace
and merchants must compete successfully for customer loyalty to thrive in
today’s market. This can make loyalty programs expensive and
time-consuming to manage. The management and administration of these
programs can present staff training challenges. For merchants who do not
currently offer a rewards program, the learning curve can be significant. These
programs are usually customized and require time and upfront investment
before they can be deployed. Loyalty solutions in today’s marketplace are
generally not plug-and-play and not intended for cross-border collection or
redemption.

GreenPower, the native store-of-value unit of the Powerchain, is designed to
serve as a global rewards currency. It offers a number of advantages over
other forms of rewards, including that it can be easily redeemed for goods
and services, and converted/exchanged into other forms of digital or fiat value.
Unlike most rewards, GreenPower is not pegged to a particular fiat currency. It
is a free-trading store-of-value unit that can increase or decrease in value
based on marketplace dynamics.

There are specific applications that further support this use case:

e GreenRewards.com: This is a universal customer loyalty
program that uses GreenPower as its primary rewards currency.
The participants in this program, who are either free or paid
members, actively collect GreenPower as a rebate on purchases
at a variety of online retailers.

e Traveleum.com: This is a discount travel membership that
provides crypto-back rewards on various travel services,
including hotels, flights, car rentals, condo stays, and cruises.
Participants in this program, who are either free or paid
members, collect crypto-back rewards and receive double
rewards if they select to receive GreenPower.

Other Use Cases

The unique combination of hybridized features makes the Powerchain an
ideal system for a number of additional use cases. The Powerchain enables
the creation of new solutions that significantly enhance applications that had
vid June 14th 2019

previously used more centralized traditional formats. Several of these new
applications are already in development, including:

Stable Coins & Tokenized Assets: The Powerchain is well suited for the
operation of collateralized stable coins and tokenized assets (e.g., precious
metals, real estate, artwork). Tokens that are collateralized or backed by
commodities or other real assets inherently have centralized repositories
where the underlying value is being held. Integrating the necessary control
and security protocols to manage these arrangements on a blockchain makes
the Powerchain a natural choice for these types of applications.

Real-Time Crypto Payments Gateway: Using the Powerchain’s native
exchange, a payment gateway can be created that would enable real-time
conversion of digital assets from one variety to another. When applied to the
realm of payments, this type of gateway would make it possible to use
GreenPower as well as other cryptocurrencies (provided each has adequate
liquidity) for payment mechanisms.

Mediated Crowdsourcing Platform: Since the development of a derivative
token involves an inherent level of centralization, the management of various
types of token offerings can take place on the Powerchain. Specialized
formats of tokens, such as the premium token, which distributes value to
token holders based on the achievement of agreed-upon Key Performance
Indicators (KPIs), can be easily developed and managed using built-in features
of the Powerchain.

Real-Time Crypto Payment By Debit Card: While there have been a number
of debit cards that enable users to sweep over fiat currency proceeds from a
previous sale of crypto assets for use in card purchases, a better solution
involves the automated real-time conversion of a crypto asset at the time of
the purchase decision. Over the past nine months, a proof-of-concept of this
solution has been deployed to a test group of approximately 500 users that
have successfully completed more than 5,000 transactions in 33 currencies
and in over 50 countries.

Hybrid Escrow Service: Escrow services have historically always been highly
centralized. With an inherent need for dispute resolution, which is nearly
impossible to do within decentralized systems, the Powerchain offers
compelling features that support the operation of various escrow services. A
peer-to-peer escrow exchange is the first use case that will make use of the
Powerchain’s built-in escrow capabilities.

Security

Security is of paramount importance within the system. The system is
protected through a combination of factors including the systemic defense of
its unique consensus model which features peer-to-peer communication
between nodes using white-listed IP addresses as well as a series of
operational security protocols for use in the key management of critical

elements of the system.

Convenience

Wherever possible, the system incorporates features that improve
convenience and ease of use. Security and convenience are often
diametrically opposed, but the system has been designed to optimize the
balance of these two important characteristics.

Efficiency

The Powerchain was developed to operate efficiently, increase throughput
and speed-up transactions. Bitshares is the core of the Powerchain’s
processing engine and benefits from the efficiencies of DPoS and Graphene
toolkit elements to facilitate an extremely high transaction capacity.

Sustainability

A prime objective of the entire system has been long-term sustainability. The
system was conceived to reliably and efficiently operate for decades into the
future. Decisions were made in the architecture of the system that was in
alignment with that goal.

Transparency

Data is available publicly and anyone can access it to check the balances and
transactions on Powerchain’s Block Explorer (www.grnexplorer.io) and this
maintains the transparency and data integrity among the users.

Authenticity

The transaction and the flow of data are not held by any single entity and can
be accessed by the participants of the Powerchain system. The actions
performed by the participants within this network are verified by the nodes
which maintain the authenticity of the system.

Privacy
The system was designed to preserve the privacy of individuals without the
need for anonymity. Transparency is maintained, without any compromise to
vid June 14th 2019

either the system security or the preservation of the privacy of network
participants.

Simplicity
An overarching goal is to keep the system as simple as possible, particularly
related to all user interactions.

Trust

A prime objective is to use the infrastructure of a digital asset system to build
an effective network of trust, enabling all participants and stakeholders to
share a common goal of increasing the value of the network and cultivating
its growth. The network will achieve this by granting trust to certain roles
(such as the Board and chain authorities) to perform chain management and
maximize the efficiency and utility of the network, programmatically ensuring
that each trusted role is well defined and does not overstep the boundaries of
its authority.

The system provides an inherent incentive to behave within the common
interest of the network, and makes sure that any misbehaving authority is
shut off from the network and liable to be punished for breaking the rules. The
accuracy and level of operations of the blockchain are verified by qualified
third parties, providing a high degree of transparency while also ensuring that
the privacy of all participants of the system is well preserved.

System On-Boarding

Digital Wallet Partner

The Green Ecosystem has licensed a Singapore company to provide its native
digital wallet service. The company also conducts Know Your Customer (KYC)
information about each client, follows Anti-Money Laundering (AML)
procedures, and provides a number of services in support of participants who
choose to access GreenPower within the ecosystem’s associated wallet
system. This digital wallet system requires the use of a hardware device (either
a branded Validator or a Ledger Nano S/X) to transact higher thresholds of
activity.

Blockchain Exchange
The Powerchain incorporates a decentralized exchange that trades, settles
and clears GreenPower over its blockchain autonomously.
vid June 14th 2019

Partner Exchanges

Additional access points for handling GreenPower and other digital assets
derived from the Powerchain include several public cryptocurrency
exchanges. Trading under the symbol of GRN, GreenPower can be purchased,
sold and held in accounts through these exchanges, which include CoinBene,
CoinFalcon, IDAX, BTC-Alpha and EUBX.

Network Elements

The node network supporting GreenPower has a permissioned structure
which incorporates "chain authorities" and Board management to streamline
control, enable better performance, assure sustainability, facilitate faster
iterations and ultimately support more innovative applications.

There are several unique elements to the network deployment of the
Powerchain.

Master Nodes

The role of the Master Node is to aggregate transactions with the intention to
produce Blocks. Only Master Nodes have the authority to write transactions
into the Blockchain ledger history. Each Master Node is aware of the other
and they must have been voted in by the governing system. Master Nodes are
novel in that their authority is represented with cryptographic keys. This
means that each Master Node must have registered its Public Key and will
sign with its Private Key during the time of Block Production. Therefore, it is

possible to hold any one particular Master Node accountable for its actions.

Ledger Nodes

Ledger Nodes are non-authoritative maintainers of the Powerchain. In other
words, Ledger Nodes do not produce blocks, yet they aggregate transactions
and pass them to the Master Nodes for Block inclusion. Ledger Nodes are able
to verify transactions are therefore useful for both increasing the footprint of
the GreenPower Consensus Network and permitting connectivity to reach
farther without requiring the need to assign authority to the node.

Transaction propagation is accelerated because of Ledger Nodes.

Consortium Structure

There are always trade-offs in configuring a blockchain system. No system can
offer all the best aspects in one configuration. Certain factors must be
balanced, as an increase in one leads to a decrease in another. Nonetheless,

19
vid June 14th 2019

while the consortium structure features a lower number of nodes and is less
decentralized, it is able to deliver the high security of law latency finality, and
the high scalability that accompanies reduced overhead. Overall, this
consortium approach delivers what is arguably the best combination of
characteristics.

Low Latency Finality
Low Overhead
Small Number of Nodes

Low Latency Finality High Latency Finality
High Overhead Low Overhead
Large Number of Nodes Large Number of Nodes

Low latency finality provides high security. A large number of nodes provides high decentralization. A low
overhead provides high scalability. You cannot obtain highs for all three, as there are tradeoffs to each metric.

Board of Directors

The Powerchain enables a governing board to regulate the parameters of the
network. The Board is comprised of members nominated and appointed by
the Chairman. Mr. Michael Mathias currently serves as the Chairman of the
Board of Directors.

e The role of the Board is to propose and modify chain parameters, to
support the normal functioning and growth of the network.

e The Chain Executive performs certain delegate actions to check the
power of said executive with the ability to terminate their access to the
network to avoid the risk probability.

e The Board itself has no control on the state of the database or the
construction of the blockchain and is programmatically prevented from

making any changes to it.

e The network itself manages and maintains the state of the transaction
ledger, as it is the only way for making any undesired changes to

20
vid June 14th 2019

subvert the majority of Master Nodes without any interference of the
Board.

e An Executive Director who works on the Board is responsible for
ensuring all its decisions and initiatives that are enacted and enforced
for completing the management of the network.

The Executive Director is responsible for directly overseeing all Chain
Authorities and can attend all Board meetings but is not permitted to vote,
unless during a crisis when an additional vote is required in order to satisfy the
condition of three votes.

Chain Authorities

Chain authority roles exist to handle smooth inputs to the Powerchain of user
data that exists outside of the system. The problem with fully decentralized
systems is the fact that they cannot have reliable inputs, for example, Bitcoin
is created internally in the Bitcoin blockchain and is merely transferred
around. In order for a system to have reliable inputs, there must be the
certainty that value has been contributed to the network. Value cannot exist
without an independent observer and so the only way to verify that the user
has submitted the value to the system is to maintain an impartial observer.

Each authority role is set up in such a way that:

e There is no way for the authority to make a meaningful unwanted
impact on the state of the network as the network can fall back toa
failsafe state.

e The actions of the authority are checked by a separate authentication
authority and there are programmed measures to assure there is
minimal chance of collusion.

e There are incentives to perform in the best interest of the network.

e Any malicious action by the chain authority is transparent and will lead
to that account being marked as untrustworthy, shut off from the
network and penalized.

Chain Operations
The Board sets the procedures and ensures the proper execution of the
following:

e The authorization of Master Nodes and Ledger Nodes within the
Powerchain network infrastructure.

2)
vid June 14th 2019

e Intervention at times of crisis,
e Execution of all Board Parameters

The Executive Director oversees the performance of all chain authorities,
manages the flow of proposals for the Board to consider, and facilitates
referendums. Provided proper procedures have been followed and necessary
thresholds have been surpassed, the Executive Director is responsible for
enforcing all Board initiatives and decisions, and is fully accountable to the
Board for all operations within the system.

Overall System Efficiency

The Powerchain system relies on a shared chain state in the memory
database of stateful objects related to user data such as account balances of
GreenPower (and other digital assets). Blockchain state is fully reproducible by
applying the transactions in order. The blockchain nodes form the state by
applying transactions from the previous blocks, however, the state consensus
is reached by following the longest chain of blocks that node can see.

One of the main goals of the Powerchain is a high capacity of fast
transactions. Because each node stores the shared state in memory,
transactions can be quickly validated across the network. This significantly
increases the number of transactions that can be included in a block and
thereby increases the overall throughput of the network. There is no

demanding Proof-of-Work required to sign a block, each witness can quickly

collect and verify transactions against the global state to form a block of valid
transactions, or sign them with their block signing key and transmit the
signed block to the rest of the network. Nodes can also quickly roll back
transactions in case of consensus failure, both in case the block being rejected

due to being on a shorter fork during fork resolution) or due to the

transaction expiring without being included in any blocks.

Long-Term Sustainability

There are inherent efficiencies to the Proof-of-Authority and Delegated
Proof-of-Stake consensus models. Rather than incur the financial burden of
protecting an openly-configured network of peer-to-peer servers, these
methods of reaching consensus employ significantly more efficient means for
reaching consensus.

22
vid June 14th 2019

By balancing aspects of centralization with elements of decentralization, the
system is capable of managing itself through a sufficiently randomized but
highly-efficient consensus method. By incorporating closed-system
architecture in the operation of its consortium of network nodes, while
preserving open-system dynamics in other aspects of the system, the
Powerchain is able to benefit from the advantages of blockchain protocol
without the burden of the inefficiencies associated with decentralized
open-system architecture and with reduced security challenges versus those
associated with centralized systems. Together, these dynamics create a
blockchain system that features high security, high scalability and is
extremely sustainable over the long term.

Growth Dynamics of the Ecosystem

The ecosystem is a vital part of the growth strategy that leads to mainstream
adoption of GreenPower. The different components of the ecosystem work
together to build grow the scale of the overall system and increase utility and
liquidity.

Stage 1 - Foundation: The first stage of the ecosystem involved establishing
the fundamental components of the ecosystem, including the blockchain, the
network, the digital wallet system and the initial distribution of the
store-of-value units, as well as connecting to a number of exchanges. This
period lasted 3 years from June 2016 to May 2019. There is now a fixed number
of GreenPower units and all have been distributed.

Stage 2 - Momentum: With all units of GreenPower fully distributed, the focus
is now on increasing the utility of the coins. GreenPower is meant to be used
by merchants as an incentive for purchase and a reward for loyalty.
GreenRewards is the universal reward program that enables any merchant in
the world to quickly and easily offer customers a world-class customer loyalty
program. Traveleum is a prime example that shows how a company can
integrate GreenPower into its business. Traveleum offers GRN as
“crypto-back” rewards on the purchase of travel services and also pays its
affiliate marketers in GRN each time a VIP membership is sold.

As a reward and incentive for customers, GreenPower needs to be easily
redeemable for a wide range of products and services. The range of

23
vid June 14th 2019

redemption possibilities can be significantly increased through GRN-enabled
payment solutions (e.g., GreenRewards card, AlliancePay cards and the
next-generation closed-loop payment system) and the proliferation of our
proprietary payment gateway (which enables GRN to be integrated into many

existing payment systems).

As a universal unit of reward for customer loyalty, GreenPower must be easily
collectible at a wide spectrum of merchants, both online and offline, in
countries throughout the world. Merchants will be added by professional
affiliates who stand to gain long-term residual streams of rewards for each

merchant added to the system. These affiliates receive ongoing rewards
through the wallet’s affiliate program as compensation for connecting both

consumers and merchants to the wallet solutions.

The affiliates offer merchants an innovative closed-loop payment system that
offers savings, automated rewards and added security for in-system transfers
where both consumer and merchant are part of the digital wallet system) of a
variety of fiat and cryptocurrencies. The system also facilitates payments from
the full spectrum of traditional providers, such as Mastercard, Visa, and PayPal.
t also offers the merchant a way to offer a customized loyalty program for

their customer base that rewards and incentivizes with GreenPower.

The wallet is the heart of the ecosystem. Many of the benefits of the
ecosystem are accessed directly through the wallet, including access to
exchanges, marketplace, and payment products. The wallet is the center for
the consumer as well as for the merchant. As more and more consumers
collects rewards through the wallet, and as more and more merchants reward
their customers through the wallet, there will be increasing demand for
GreenPower. Since GreenPower is of a fixed quantity and is already fully
distributed, the added demand is likely to increase the price of GreenPower.
The greater the growth of users (collecting and rewarding), the stronger the
demand will be on the limited supply of GreenPower. If this happens ona
global basis in a strong enough manner, GreenPower can establish itself as

the definitive rewards currency for the world.

Conclusion

The strength of GreenPower is its global utility, the structure of the
Powerchain and the alliance of companies, known as the Green Ecosystem,
that supports it.

Mainstream Utility: GreenPower has been designed to address the issues
that have prevented digital currencies from being adopted by mainstream
users. Rather than compete with fiat currencies as a primary payment
mechanism, GreenPower is instead positioned to serve as a global rewards
currency that can be offered as an incentive by merchants, collected easily by
consumers and effortlessly redeemed for a wide range of goods and services.
This system of digitally-stored value is capable of solving many of the
problems associated with traditional customer loyalty programs. As the
rewards currency for one of the world’s first universal customer loyalty
programs, GreenPower is well positioned to attract a critical mass of
mainstream users throughout the world.

Optimal Liquidity: The health of any asset can be defined by the difference
between the “buy” price and the “sell” price. The lower the spread, the
healthier the market environment, and the stronger the asset. The quality of
the fundamentals of the asset combined with the awareness of the market
determines the level of the spread. The fundamentals of any cryptocurrency
begin with its structure and are heavily influenced by the quality of the initial
distribution, its utility, performance, capacity, ability to scale and the ability for
the system to sustain itself. GreenPower’s fundamentals are extremely strong,
starting with the quality of its initial distribution, building on the potential
impact of its primary use case and its many additional use cases, and finishing
with the soundness of its network architecture and the long-term viability of
its operations model. All of these factors can work together to enhance the
quality of GreenPower’s liquidity. Consequently, as the market better
understands the strength of GreenPower’s fundamentals, its liquidity is likely
to increasingly approach optimal levels.

Enduring Efficiency: In the past, there wasn’t enough emphasis on the
infrastructure requirements of blockchain deployments, specifically the
elements that relate to reliability, availability, scalability and maintainability.
These are crucial factors to ensuring that the blockchain can play a viable role
in the financial lives of mainstream users. An entire level of quality assurance
has been omitted from the realm of blockchain technology mainly due to the

26
vid June 14th 2019

inherent limitations of the decentralized nature of most blockchain
technology. The Powerchain provides this missing element through its
“hybrid” structure, combining the strongest elements of decentralized
systems with certain advantages of more centralized systems. The
Powerchain’'s structure enables the network supporting GreenPower to
deliver world-class performance, seamless scalability and long-term efficiency.

By adapting trust to the digital paradigm, the Green Ecosystem is uniquely
structured to provide its participants with the benefits of mainstream utility,
optimal liquidity and enduring efficiency. By fulfilling its immense potential,
GreenPower is positioned to unlock unprecedented levels of prosperity
throughout the world.

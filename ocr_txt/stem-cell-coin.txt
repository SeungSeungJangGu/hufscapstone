This white paper describes the first sale of the Stem Cell Coin (SCC).

As described in this paper, SCC is a cryptocurrency which has been designed to use for
all the services provided by the Stem Cell Project team and its affiliate companies.

The SCC token has been created on the basis of Ethereum network, so this token has no
nature of securities in any legal jurisdiction.

This paper is not for inviting investors or for offering securities by any means in any
legal jurisdiction.

Please note that purchasing SCC is all definitive and non-refundable.

Individual, company and any other organization must consider risks of purchasing SCC
and its costs and benefits carefully.

Information contained in this paper and the whole document is not comprehensive.
Also, this paper does not represent privity of contract between our company and token
purchasers.

The accuracy, reliability and integrity of materials included in this paper or provided
other sites in association with this ICO are not guaranteed, and we accept no legal
responsibilities for that.

For other companies and individuals, SCC does not represent, warrant or promise truth,
accuracy and integrity of any kind of information described in this paper, and SCC does
not intend to do so. SCC also disclaims representation, warranty or promise on them.

Important Items Requiring Confirmation

Purchasing SCC can carry a serious risk. We consider that the purchasers have already
accepted the following risks before buying the coins.

¢ The purchasers recognize that some services in the Stem Cell Project are currently
under development and a major modification may occur in the period to the start of
the services.

* The purchasers understand that expectations for the forms and features of the Stem
Cell Project may not be fulfilled due to various reasons.

¢ The purchasers understand that some cryptocurrency exchanges may deny
connection to this project although SCC devotes best efforts to connect to major
exchanges and, as a result, the liquidity provided through platform may become
lower than that expected in this paper.

¢ The purchasers understand that the date of official release may be late although
SCC devotes best efforts to start as scheduled.

* There may be broad fluctuations of the value of SCC and its lowering due to
various reasons.

° SCC will be issued in NEO blockchain. Therefore, transfer of SCC or purchasers’
capability of holding the coin safely may be affected by troubles of NEO protocol
or unexpected function.

eSTEM CELL PROJECT
What is ICO?

ICO (Initial Coin Offering) is a method for financial arrangements by issuing an original
digital token and selling it.

This is not to assign equity like stock funding but to simply sell the token like reward-
based crowdfunding.

The token is not recognized as a “cryptocurrency” at the time of selling, which means
that the ICO is not the method for “financial arrangements” by strict definition but is for
selling the token. Thus those who buy it are not “investors” for the project but are the
“purchasers of the token.”

At the point in time, the SCC token cannot be used as repayment for a consideration for
unspecified persons, and it is considered that this ICO project fits the above-mentioned
definitions since it is in a situation where there is no exchange market between the token
and the legal currencies, Bitcoin, and any other existing cryptocurrencies.

Purposes of ICO

All the produced funds will be used for development of the Stem Cell Project.

Concepts of Our Project

In industrialized countries including Japan, which have increasingly aging populations,
the number of people suffering chronic diseases are increasing.

Because of development of public transports, people don’t exercise enough and begin to
have obese and metabolic syndrome. Thus health maintenance/promotion captures their
interest. Concept of “health care” becomes very important nowadays. On the other hand,
the number of qualified professionals such as medical doctors and nurses is decreasing.
Time to wait for the physical examination by a doctor is getting longer, and the burden
of the medical experts is also getting heavier year after year. In such a circumstance, we
will develop “AI Personal Doctor” on the basis of the concept “eSelfcare” for health
maintenance of people around the world. We will provide “Aging Well Concept” which
is self-maintenance of own health by oneself to the whole world.

Assumed 1 billion people in the
world become 60 years old or

From 60% to 80% of world

population have a lack of exercise

People tend to have a lack of exercise as their
cultures are developing. As a result, they
experience body weight gain which leads to chronic
diseases such as diabetes mellitus and
hypertension. There have been tools which can lead
them to a healthy state and maintain the state. Our
challenge is to find out how to utilize these tools to
obtain better results for becoming healthy.

8.6 million people in the world
suffer some chronic diseases

8.6 million people in the whole world, and the
number is growing at a phenomenal speed. In fact, it
is estimated that about *4 of causes of death in the
world will be chronic disease by 2020. If chronic
diseases are well managed by patients, their family
members and health care teams, patients can enjoy
their life healthier and also the burden of treatment
costs can be minimized. Additional burden will

cause a crisis.

©STEM CELL PROJECT

over by 2025

By 2025, it is assumed that the population of 60
years old or over is increased further. In addition to
the currently aging industrialized countries, the
developing countries with rapid population growth
will soon become aging societies. Do you think
their dreams of life with peace, safe and
comfortable will come true? What should we do
before worldwide aging societies become reality.

professionals are reducing

According to the report in 2006 by WHO, we
need 4.3 million more medical doctors, nurses
and medical support staff, and such a situation is
not expected to improve in the future. They are
already insufficient in number, and how can we
keep providing essential medical and welfare
services?

Number of qualified .

2 technologies playing a role in the future health will open new
doors

To obtain vital data such as body temperature, blood pressure, and pulse rate easily, we
need technologies to sense the physical quantities. The obtained biological information
are not discarded after temporal usage but accumulated and the course will be followed.

In order to make the above happen, high-security network which can transfer data freely
is necessary. When the 2 technologies are integrated, people’s lifestyles and
environments will change significantly. The change is what we are providing:

Future medical services achieved by IoT and Blockchain
AI Personal Doctor (Keep all the doctors in the world for oneself)

Our vision is to bring a new structure with AI and Blockchain to the old medical system.
This can be a breakthrough in the healthcare industry and bring affluent society in
which people live in health.

We revolutionize medical services with AI and Blockchain.

The revolution, however, doesn’t destroy the structure of the current medical services,
but rather aims to complement the current services and expand their breadth.

As an example, utilization of cutting-edge sensing technologies and chatbots reduce the
burden of medical staff and improve the accuracy of medical examinations, and also
application of AI analysis and Blockchain create a new medical service in the area of
private practice (no health insurance applicable). We aim to spread these across the
world

Our final goal is to create a environment that everyone can always receive high-quality
medical services wherever they are. Labor force in the medical field also decreases as
the population decreases. In such a situation, the condition to receive advanced
treatment becomes even tougher for patients. Along with improving the skills of doctors,
procedures associated with medical examinations need to be reduced.

©STEM CELL PROJECT yy,
Brief Overview of Our Project

Stem Cell Project is a medical project mainly focused on the following 2 points:
Development and popularization of (1) a means of payment for the costs of stem cell
treatment at the affiliate hospitals and (2) pathological/diagnostic imaging systems by
using AI and Blockchain.

The followings are the 4 main purposes of our project:
1. Make stem cell treatment possible to pay in cryptocurrency

Stem cell therapy helps to activate weakened cells and proliferate important cells
declining in number daily.

After stem cell administration, the cells are circulating through the body. Once finding
out damaged tissues, the stem cells are activated by themselves and trying to repair and
regenerate the tissues.

This therapy shows promise for treatment of anti-aging, diabetes mellitus, etc. However,
currently, stem cell therapy can be provided only in medically advanced countries.

In recent years, stem cell therapy has captured the world’s attention. So, we are
expecting worldwide financial inflow to regenerative medicine by means of
cryptocurrency payment.

2. Introduction of pathological/diagnostic imaging systems with AI and Blockchain

We are developing the near-future health check system which can share automatic
diagnoses with images and pathological data among clinics and hospitals in the world
by using AI and Blockchain technologies.

We will let the system grow to the level that can screen medical big data rapidly and
accurately.

We are also planning to use the provided big data for revealing relationship to cancers
on the basis of the patient information such as nationality, race, gender and age.

eSTEM CELL PROJECT
3. Development of Virtual Clinic Platform

When patients experience illness/disorders, they often have following questions, “Which
hospital should I go?” and “Which department should I choose?” Also visiting hospital
just for receiving medicines is wasting time and becomes burden for patients.

In order to solve such problems, we develop Virtual Clinic Platform which can make
patients feel a closer connection to doctors by using the network among the member
hospitals/clinics of Japan Society of Aesthetic Regenerative Medicine and Albot diagnosis,
remote medical checkup system, search/reservation of hospitals/clinics. All the payments
in the platform can be done in SCC.

*AlIbot diagnosis: AI can predict suspected patient’s disease(s) only with asking
questions regarding symptoms and affected parts.

*Remote medical checkup system: Doctors can examine patients who cannot visit
medical institutions for reasons of their living environments by using video calls etc.

4. Research and clinical work of therapeutic formulations with stem cells

The final goal of our Stem Cell Project is “pharmaceuticalization of stem cells.”

By doing research and clinical work of therapeutic formulations with stem cells and
putting them into public circulation, we will be able to achieve our aims to give more
opportunities to those who need regenerative medicine and to optimize the treatment costs.
Keeping development of the world’s first “Cell Bank” in mind, we also create a
surrounding in which people with diseases can be treated with their own cells which took
and stored beforehand at their healthy state.

eSTEM CELL PROJECT

More Details on 1.

Stem cell therapy has been attracting worldwide attention in recent years, however, the
therapy can be currently provided only in 5 countries such as the US, Germany,
Switzerland, Russia (only at governmental institutions), and Japan.

Amid increasing demand for stem cell therapy especially in Asia, the therapy can be
currently provided only in Japan among other Asian nations.

In Japan, hospitals/clinics which can provide stem cell therapy need to obtain approval
of Class II Regenerative Medicine accredited by the Ministry of Health, Labor and
Welfare. One of our project team, Association of Medical Corporation Koge-Kai, is
planning to obtain the approval of Class IT Regenerative Medicine and is having a clinic
where stem cell therapy can be given. Although we have the clinic in which a number of
people can be treated, the payment method for the treatment costs is an issue. Especially
in China, there is the regulation on annual limit of taking Chinese yuan out of China,
and thus, although the demand is increasing, it is currently difficult for them to bring
their own currency to other countries for the treatment which costs about 6 to 8 million
yen per time.

Introduction of a payment system in cryptocurrency can solve this issue. While the
number of individual investors holding cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin is growing, we
are planning to expand customers of our hospitals/affiliate clinics by using SCC as a
payment method.

eSTEM CELL PROJECT

The final goal of this system is to bridge the gaps among the worldwide medical
technologies.

This system has been developed because of lack of medical specialists which is the issue
of the current healthcare industry.

Rare diseases and diseases which are difficult to detect tend to be found out by thorough
examinations in university hospitals or general hospitals, and there are many cases
which could not be detected or treated at minor hospitals/clinics. This can be associated
with the major issue of lack of pathologists.

A similar situation can be seen in other medically advanced countries. Especially in
China, there are only around 10,000 pathologists for the population of 1.4 billion, which
is a serious scarcity of labor.

As a result, patients gather at major hospitals.

Brief overview of the system is that data of CT and X-ray images are scanned by AI
system in which medical big data have been introduced. This can lead to early detection
of variety of diseases and detection of rare diseases.

Furthermore, by using this system on Blockchain, diagnostic data can be shared at the
medical institutions with the system, which can lead to medical technology
improvement. Thus, even the minor hospitals and developing countries can manage
high-level medical technology, and gaps of the medical technology will be filled by this
system.

We propose Virtual Clinic Platform. Patients can receive various medical services on 1
device online wherever they are.

A variety of contents will be added such as remote medical checkup system, chatbot and
translation function.

eSTEM CELL PROJECT

More Details on 4.

This is directly connected to the point of our philosophy “Regenerative Medicine to the
World.”

Stem cell therapy has been attracting worldwide attention to a variety of symptoms and
anti-aging effect; however, only some wealthy people can receive the therapy (mostly
for anti-aging) due to the high cost. Thus stem cell therapy is not considered as a
therapy for patients in need.

For the issue, our project is aiming to “optimize stem cell therapy cost.”

Since our project team has been established a special technology to culture stem cells
rapidly and accuracy, mass culturing is possible.

By improving this technology and optimizing the treatment cost, we can give more
opportunities to those who need regenerative medicine.

We aim to make regenerative medicine closer to our life by pharmaceuticalization of
stem cells on the basis of research and clinical work.

Currently, the clinics of our project team provides stem cell treatment under the
approval of Class II Regenerative Medicine accredited by Ministry of Health, Labor and
Welfare, however; approval of Class I Regenerative Medicine is essential for
pharmaceuticalization of stem cells.

We will obtain appropriate approval while the project is going further and then provide
regenerative medicine to the people who need it.

Advantages of our project are not only providing IT services in healthcare, but also
holding a medical corporation, JSARM and clinics in the team. Our aim is not to raise
funds for startup like a general feature of ICO, but to grow our business further.

We can introduce and operate the payment system and diagnostic imaging system at our
own clinics first, which is because the Stem Cell Project includes the medical
corporation.

What is Stem Cell?

The human body is comprised of 60 trillion cells and more than 200 types of cells. Each
type of cells has a role to play such as cells to grow hairs, cells to activate skin.

There are cells which don’t have specific role and can become several types of cells.
This is “Stem Cells.”

Stem cells have:
1. Potential to divide repeatedly and proliferate the same type of cells.
2. Potential to become several different types of cells.

Stem cells gather around damaged area and divide and proliferate repeatedly, which
facilitates regeneration of the cells and restores the tissue functions.

What is Stem Cell Therapy?

Stem cell therapy helps to activate weakened cells and proliferate important cells which
are declining in number daily. After stem cell administration, the cells are circulating
through the body.

Once finding out damaged tissues, the stem cells are activated by themselves and trying to
repair and regenerate the tissues.

After catching SDF-1 signal from the damaged area, the administered stem cells are
migrating to that area. And the cells repair the area rapidly and move to another area (hit-
and-run phenomenon).

The stem cells further stimulate pituitary gland, which restores the hormonal balance and
metabolism cycle to a healthy state.

The recent stem cell researches reveal that health of many organs can be maintained over a
lifetime with permanent regeneration of stem cells. On the other hand, organs/tissues are
aging as stem cells are aging.

In other words, it is medically recognized that stem cells play an essential role in changes
caused by aging.

“Stem cells” = “Core role in research on aging”

A feature of stem cells is to regenerate organs damaged by
illness and injury and to restore functions of the organs.

Pathological/diagnostic imaging systems by AI and Blockchain

Deep Learning has been greatly developed and is currently gathering attentions in
various areas by tremendous improvement of computer performance, collection of big
data due to the spread of World Wide Web and internet devices, and various research
outcomes. Deep Learning has overwhelming recognition performance especially in the
field of pathology image recognition. In the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition
Challenge (ILSVRC) where competitions of recognition accuracy of generic object
images are held, the accuracy has kept greatly improving since 2012 when Deep
Learning was introduced, and eventually, in 2015, it overtook human recognition
performance. Deep Learning will be applied in a variety of fields of healthcare with
Blockchain.

Deep Learning, comparing to other computational techniques, can achieve great
accuracy; however, in order to gain such accuracy, it requires a great deal of leaning
time even with currently available high-speed calculators. For instance, Google spent
1,000 — 2,000 hours of learning time to achieve 99.63% ultrahigh-accuracy in
convolutional neural network, FaceNet, which recognizes human face images.

We are going to handle much bigger Blockchain network and lead to complete solutions
for various medical issues by using Deep Learning. In terms of future issues, since it is
not considered practical that the each issue will be learnt with longer time, our purpose
is to reduce leaning time drastically by accelerating the leaning speed.

As an experiment which have already started, we are turning an algorithm for speeding
up of Deep Learning into reality with the idea of a new architecture of data flow by
using distributed memory with a keyword of “parallelization.” At the current stage, we
provide aforementioned pathological imaging diagnosis and capillary diagnosis in our
medical practice. Moreover, we aim to get high throughput/high power efficiency with

small temporal granularity by achieving high-speed learning with dedicated processors.

Issues Faced by Health Industry

1. Cost-saving of pathological diagnosis

© Improvement of diagnostic efficiency and prevention of missing cancer diagnoses by
automatic screening of digital images and double-check function of Automated
Pathological Service by Applied Mathematics (APSAM).

© Cost-saving for each hospital (saving of storage space for pathological samples by
digitalization, increase of income with remote pathological diagnosis)

2. Solution of limited number of pathologists

© Developed regions: saving labor of pathologists, making double-check of diagnoses
happen

© Developing countries: improvement of levels of pathological diagnosis at hospitals
having no veteran pathologists, offering of remote pathological services for hospitals
having no pathologists and improvement of quality of medical services with educational
tools.

3. Homogenization of treatment level (sharing of diagnostic criteria)
4. Development of processing methods for big data of pathological images
© Indexing pathological image data enables to process medical big data and contributes
to the improvement of medical services.

Global needs and Pricing

Increase of number of cancer patients

© Developed countries such as Japan have a tendency toward aging of population, and
thus an increase in the number of cancer patients is expected.

© According to improvement of healthcare system, major diseases causing death (e.g.
infection) is decreasing even in developing countries.

© Although cancer is a disease which we haven’t overcome yet, a complete cure could
be achieved if treatment is appropriately given.

© Phathologists who indicate treatment methods require sufficient training.

Needs Not enough pathologists throughout the world
© Developed countries: Computer aided systems are necessary due to busy schedule
© Developing countries: Very few pathologists — support system is necessary (if

possible, a system which can determine a certain level of pathology)

© Important to have systems which cover and support improvement of infrastructure

(e.g. Remote diagnosis)

Pricing

© Usage charge of APSAM will be covered by social insurance, except in the US.

olt is difficult to fix a price because pathologists have different status and role in each
country.

© At this point in time, 30%-40% of payment amount for pathological diagnosis is
considered as the cost for a patient.

© Usually, 90% of the part of a pathological sample is normal, and thus development of
a system which can extract abnormal parts only contributes to improvement of
pathological diagnostic efficiency.

In light of that, we will set the price in comparison with the actual hiring cost of a

pathologist.

Concept of Virtual Clinic Platform

When patients experience illness/disorders, they often have following questions,
“Which hospital should I go?” and “Which department should I choose?” Also visiting
hospital just for receiving medicines is wasting time and becomes burden for patients.

In order to solve such problems, we develop Virtual Clinic Platform which can make
patients feel a closer connection to doctors by using the network among the member
hospitals/clinics of Japan Society of Aesthetic Regenerative Medicine and Albot
diagnosis, remote medical checkup system, search/reservation of hospitals/clinics.
Various contents are added to this platform, and we create environment where patients
can easily receive medical services online.

All the payments in the platform can be done in SCC.

All the process from reservation to payment of medical examination
can be done online. Patients can receive medicines and _ their
prescription at home. The storage of medicines and sales can be
managed at the same time.

Patients visiting a hospital can use the BLE system, which is used as a

registration card.

Sensor Network

A sensor network cognizes one’s circumstances and autonomously cooperates with
others. This is an essential technology to realize a healthy and wealthy society and can
be applied to a wide range of areas such as healthcare, welfare, crime prevention,
security, disaster prevention, environmental risks. This is developing for our future

social/economic activities.

a ™ Japanese society of aesthetic regenerative medicine
© stxsecnees

Our society has been established with the purpose of contribution to development of
regenerative medicine in Japan by improvement and dissemination of research of
regenerative medicine practices and publication/communication and exchange of their
knowledge.

Although we named our society “aesthetic,” it doesn’t mean we are dedicated to
cosmetic medicine. We use the word “aesthetic” because we develop the society into
multiple fields of regenerative medicine including cosmetic medicine. Of course, we are
going to mention alternatives of new treatment centering on dentistry.

In light of conditions of the times, our activities (working together with other societies
and organizations) include providing advice for observational studies for the medical
guidelines which is applicable to the regenerative medicine law. In regard to healthcare
and studies applicable to the laws of regenerative medicine and clinical studies, we
cooperate with the certified special committee for regenerative medicine, certified
committee for regenerative medicine, certified review board, and research ethics
committee.

Moreover, a working group with knowledgeable people on human pluripotent stem cells
and cell culturing was organized by Miho Furue in human stem cell applied research
room in National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition, a project
leader of regenerative medicine practical project “A study on standardization of
culturing technique aiming to quality variability and practical application of iPS cells”
in Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED). The group proposed
the following 5 conditions in “Fundamental principles in cell culturing.”

Ist condition: Recognize that cell culturing is derived from a part of living body.

2nd condition: Confirm reliability of the source and applicability of methods of using.
3rd condition: Prevent contamination of culturing cells.

4th condition: Manage culturing cells and handling record properly.

5th condition: Consider health and safety of culturing technicians and environmental
effect.

ARRARERRSS

We comply with the 5 conditions and have an affiliate cell processing center approved
under Regenerative Medicine Ensuring Safety Law Article 40 Clause. We are
preparing for suppling cell-processed products and physiologically active materials (e.g.
culture supernatant) adequately.

We are also preparing for providing genetic treatment, remote diagnosis,
immunotherapy, flora therapy, etc and studies on them.

However, as well as medical practice based on the law, of course, we need to comply
with the guideline of each field even though it is only partly legislated. In all the law and
guidelines, “duty of education and training” is listed in common.

In order to exercise the duty, we are going to have various training workshops, for which
we are looking for some people who support our proper dissemination of regenerative

medicine and can provide study cases and teach on the field.

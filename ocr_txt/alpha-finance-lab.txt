1. Alpha Lending Overview

Alpha Lending is a decentralized pool-based lending protocol built on Binance Smart Chain. Users can
earn interest on their digital assets (assets) by supplying supported assets into the protocol. We call these
users lenders. Assets deposited by lenders will be transferred into a smart contract that aggregates total
liquidity of each asset into a pooled fund, which is available for borrowers to borrow. Loans are not
matched individually between lenders and borrowers, but are taken from the pooled fund. Interest lenders
earn come from interest that borrowers pay, distributed proportionately to the liquidity they provide.

Once lenders supply assets into the protocol, these assets act as collateral, enabling lenders to also borrow
any asset up to a certain limit. This means that any borrower has to first supply assets into the protocol as
collateral before taking out any loan.

Done

Here is an example of the diagram above. Alice first deposits one of the supported assets, such as BNB,
into the protocol. Once deposited, the deposited BNB is added into a pooled fund, which is referred to as
the Total Liquidity. This Total Liquidity is calculated as follows:

Total Liquidity = Total Available Liquidity + Total Borrows

Total Available Liquidity is the liquidity available of that asset for borrowers to borrow or lenders to
withdraw. The Total Borrows of an asset is the sum of the total borrowed amount and the accumulated
borrow interest from all borrowers. Total Borrows is calculated as follows:

Total Borrows = Borrow Amount + Cumulative Borrow Interest

This means that Total Liquidity will continue to grow as Cumulative Borrow Interest grows over-time.
More details on interest rate can be found in section 3.5. Interest Rate Dynamics.

Alice will receive alTokens, such as alBNB, that represent her share of BNB deposited to Total Liquidity
of BNB. alToken is a tokenized representation of the user’s lending position, and is an interest-bearing
BEP20 token, which means an alToken can claim more of the underlying asset over-time as Total
Liquidity grows from interest collected from the borrowers. Number of alTokens each user receives is
calculated as follows:

Number of alTokens = Deposit Amount * Total alToken / Total Liquidity
Total alToken is set based on the first user who deposits this asset. For example, if Bob is the first user

who deposits 1,000 BNB, then Total alBNB starts with 1,000 alBNB. If Alice then adds 100 BNB when
the Total Liquidity is 1,000 BNB, then Alice gets 100 alBNB (100 * 1,000/ 1,000).

Before borrowing
Before a user can borrow, they have to first deposit some of their assets that can be used as collateral on the
protocol. Upon depositing such assets, the user receives alTokens, representing the user’s shares in the
assets’ pools. . Note that some assets are not accepted as collateral in order to protect the protocol’s
security. Even though these alTokens are used as collateral, the user will still earn deposit interest on them
since other users are borrowing the underlying asset from the asset pool and paying borrow interest to the
pool, or Total Liquidity.

For example, Alice can deposit BUSD, one of the available collateral assets, into the protocol and
receives a balance of alBUSD that represents her share in the total BUSD pool . Alice can then use this
alBUSD as collateral, enabling her to borrow other assets such as ETH. In this case, Alice is earning
deposit interest on BUSD and paying borrow interest on ETH. More details on interest rates can be found
in section 3.5. Interest Rate Dynamics.

Each asset that can be used as collateral has an assigned Asset Maximum Loan-to-value (LTV). For
instance, if Alice deposits $100 worth of BUSD, which has an Asset Maximum LTV of 75%, then Alice
can borrow any asset with the Borrow Limit of $75. Borrow Limit is calculated based on the total value of
deposited assets that can be used as collateral and Asset Maximum LTV of each deposited asset.
Specifically , the Borrow Limit for an asset can be calculated as follows:

Borrow Limit = (Deposit Value in USD of Asset:* Asset Maximum LTV; + Deposit Value in USD for Asset2* Asset
Maximum LTV, + ...)

A user can only borrow if the Account Health remains healthy after taking into account the new borrow
amount. Account Health can be calculated as follows:

Account Health = Healthy (borrow value < Borrow Limit)
Account Health = Unhealthy (borrow value > Borrow Limit)

Borrowing process
When a user borrows and receives the borrowed amount, the protocol calculates how many Borrow

Shares the borrowed amount equals to. Borrow Shares represent the share of the user’s borrowed amount
to the Total Borrows of that asset. Borrow Shares is calculated as follows:

Borrow Shares = (Borrow Amount * Total Borrow Shares) / Total Borrows

The number of Total Borrow Shares is set based on the first user who borrows this asset. For example, if
Bob is the first user who borrows 1,000 BNB, then the number of Total Borrow Shares starts with 1,000.
If Alice then borrows 100 BNB when the Total Borrows is 1,000 BNB, then Alice gets 100 Borrow
Shares (100 * 1,000 / 1,000).

Before withdrawing
A user can withdraw the amount only if there is enough Total Available Liquidity to do so and if the

Account Health remains healthy after the transaction.
Withdrawing process

10
To withdraw a part or all of the deposited amount, the protocol calculates Withdraw Shares from the
withdraw amount inputted, burns alTokens equal to the number of Withdraw Shares, and transfers the
withdraw amount to the user. Withdraw Shares is calculated as follows:

Withdraw Shares = Withdraw Amount * Total alToken / Total Liquidity

Because Total Liquidity increases over-time from accruing borrow interest, the same withdrawal amount
will equal smaller Withdraw Shares over-time, and thus burns fewer alTokens to claim the same withdraw
amount. If the user withdraws all of the deposited amount, the user will receive a withdraw amount that is
more than the originally deposited amount from accruing deposit interest. More details on interest rates
can be found in section 3.5. Interest Rate Dynamics.

Transfer repay amount to the pool

Done

To repay a part or all of the borrowed amount, the protocol calculates Repay Shares from the repay
amount inputted, transfers the repay amount to the pool, and reduces Borrow Shares by Repay Shares.
Repay Shares is calculated as follows:

1
Repay Shares = Repay Amount * Total Borrow Shares / Total Borrows

Because Total Borrows increases over-time from accruing borrow interest, the same repay amount will
equal smaller Repay Shares over-time, reducing Borrow Shares by a smaller Repay Shares. If the user
repays all of the borrowed amount, the user will pay more than the original amount because of accrued
borrow interest. More details on interest rate can be found in section 3.5. Interest Rate Dynamics.

3.5 Interest Rate Dynamics
Interest rates for borrowers and lenders are determined by Utilization Rate. Utilization Rate is calculated

as follows:
Utilization Rate = Total Borrows / Total Liquidity

Because the Utilization Rate reflects the demand to borrow an asset, a higher Utilization Rate corresponds
to a higher cost of borrowing or borrow interest rate. Each asset has its own base borrow rate and Optimal
Utilization Rate, or the specific Utilization Rate that marks the beginning of a sharp rise in Borrow
Interest Rate to protect the liquidity in the pool. Therefore, Borrow Interest Rate; and Borrow Interest
Rate2 when Utilization Rate is below and above Optimal Utilization Rate can be calculated as:

Borrow Interest Rate; when Utilization Rate < Optimal Utilization Rate:
Borrow Interest Rate = Base Borrow Rate + (Utilization Rate * Slope1)

Borrow Interest Rate2 when Utilization Rate > Optimal Utilization Rate:
Borrow Interest Rate = Slope: + [(Utilization Rate - Optimal Utilization Rate)/(100% - Optimal Utilization Rate) * Slope2]

5-10% of the Borrow Interest Rate will be allocated for Pool Reserve as an insurance for the pool. Since
the accumulated borrow interest are added to Total Liquidity and the alTokens that lenders receive can
claim the share of Total Liquidity, the higher borrow interest rate corresponds to the higher Deposit

Interest Rate, which can be calculated as:

Deposit Interest Rate = Borrow Interest Rate * Utilization Rate

Causes of liquidation
A borrower bears the risk of having an unhealthy Account Health when the user’s total value of borrowed

assets exceeds the Borrow Limit. Volatility in collateral assets and borrowed assets can cause Account
Health to be unhealthy.

For instance, Alice deposits $100 worth of BUSD, which for instance has an Asset Maximum LTV of
75%, enabling Alice to borrow any asset up to the Borrow Limit of $75, and borrows $75 of ETH (e.g.
0.18 ETH) when ETH price is $400. If ETH price increases afterwards, Alice’s total value of borrowed
assets increases since 0.18 ETH now equals to more than $75, resulting in her total value of borrowed
assets being higher than her Borrow Limit. On the other hand, Account Health can become unhealthy
when the price of the collateral asset, or in this case BUSD, decreases such that Borrow Limit becomes
less than the total value of borrowed assets.

Due to the volatile nature of asset prices, users are recommended to borrow at a value less than the
Borrow Limit to avoid liquidation.

Liquidation process
When Account Health becomes unhealthy, any external actor called a liquidator can repay up to the Close

Factor of the user’s borrowed amount. This Close Factor is the portion of the borrowed asset that can be
repaid by a liquidator in one transaction. The liquidation process may continue until the user’s Account
Health becomes healthy, or when the total value of borrowed assets is below Borrow Limit. The Close
Factor ensures that the user’s account will not be fully liquidated if not necessary.

When a liquidator repays the user’s borrowed amount, liquidator inputs Liquidate Shares and the
protocol reduces the user’s Borrow Shares by Liquidate Shares.

To reward the liquidator for liquidating an unhealthy account, the liquidator can purchase Collateral
Amount, or the value of the user’s collateral asset equivalent to the liquidate value at a discounted price.
The difference between Collateral Amount that the liquidator receives and the liquidate amount the

liquidator pays is captured by Liquidation Bonus. Collateral Amount is calculated as follows:

Collateral Amount = (Liquidate Amount * Price of Liquidated Asset / Price of Collateral Asset) * (Liquidation
Bonus)

Liquidate Amount is calculated as follows:

Liquidate Amount = (Liquidate Share * Total Borrows) / Total Borrow Shares

6. ALPHA Governance Token

ALPHA will act as the core utility token across a portfolio of Alpha products, including staking, reward
sharing through providing liquidity to or securing the protocol, as well as governance procedures. For
Alpha Lending particularly, there will be a liquidity mining program rewarding users with ALPHA for
bootstrapping liquidity on the protocol by depositing and borrowing assets.

As Alpha Finance Lab continues to innovate in the DeFi space and build more Alpha products, ALPHA
token holders will be able to propose and decide upon key protocol parameters to all Alpha products and
how the products interoperate. ALPHA tokens will continue to be the primary tool to align incentives of
community builders and supporters, creating a strong community of DeFi enthusiasts who will
collectively help propel Alpha ecosystem forward.

RISK FACTORS

RISKS RELATING TO PARTICIPATION IN THE TOKEN DISTRIBUTION EVENT (AS
DEFINED BELOW)

Purchase of products, including but not limited to cryptocurrencies / cryptographic tokens,
from start-ups such as the Token Vendor and the Project Group involve a high degree of risk

Financial and operating risks confronting start-ups are significant and the Token Vendor and the
Project Group are not immune to these. Start-ups often experience unexpected problems in the
areas of product development, marketing, financing, and general management, among others,
which frequently cannot be solved.

The Token Vendor and/or the Project Group may be forced to cease operations

It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, an unfavourable
fluctuation in the value of cryptographic and fiat currencies, the inability of the Token Vendor
and/or the Project Group to establish the Project or the Tokens’ utility, the failure of commercial
relationships, or intellectual property ownership challenges, the Token Vendor and/or the Project
Group may no longer be viable to operate and the Token Vendor and/or the Project Group may
dissolve or take actions that result in a dissolution of the Token Vendor and/or the Project Group.

The tax treatment in relation to Tokens are uncertain and there may be adverse tax
consequences for a Purchaser upon certain future events

The tax characterisation of Tokens are uncertain, and a Purchaser should seek independent tax
advice in connection with a purchase of Tokens. A purchase of Tokens may result in adverse tax
consequences to the Purchaser, including withholding taxes, income taxes, and tax reporting
requirements. The Purchaser should consult with and must rely upon the advice of its own
professional tax advisors with respect to tax treatment of a purchase of Tokens.

There is no prior market for the Tokens and the Token Distribution Event may not result in an
active or liquid market for the Tokens

Prior to a Token Distribution event (“Token Distribution Event”), there has been no public
market for the Tokens and the Tokens are not traded, whether on any cryptocurrency exchange or
otherwise. In the event that the Tokens are traded on a cryptocurrency exchange, there is no
assurance that an active or liquid trading market for the Tokens will develop or if developed, be
sustained after the Tokens have been made available for trading on such cryptocurrency
exchange. There is also no assurance that the market price of the Tokens will not decline below
the purchase consideration at which the Purchaser acquired the Tokens. Such purchase

28
consideration may not be indicative of the market price of the Tokens after they have been made
available for trading on a cryptocurrency exchange.

A Token is not a currency issued by any central bank or national, supra-national or quasi-national
organisation, nor is it backed by any hard assets or other credit. The Token Vendor and/or the
Project Group is/are not responsible for nor does it / do they pursue the circulation and trading of
Tokens on the market. Trading of Tokens merely depends on the consensus on its value between
the relevant market participants, and no one is obliged to purchase any Token from any holder of
the Token, including the purchasers, nor does anyone guarantee the liquidity or market price of
Tokens to any extent at any time. Accordingly, the Token Vendor and/or the Project Group
cannot ensure that there will be any demand or market for Tokens, or that the purchase
consideration at the relevant time is indicative of the market price of Tokens after they have been
made available for trading on a cryptocurrency exchange.

Future sales of the Tokens could materially and adversely affect the market price of Tokens

Any future sale of the Tokens (which were not available for sale in the Token Distribution
Event) would increase the supply of Tokens in the market and this may result in a downward
price pressure on the Tokens. The sale or distribution of a significant number of Tokens outside
of the Token Distribution Event, or the perception that such further sales or issuance may occur,
could adversely affect the trading price of the Tokens.

Negative publicity may materially and adversely affect the price of the Tokens

Negative publicity involving the Token Vendor, the Project Group, the Project, the Tokens and/or
any of the key personnel of the Token Vendor and/or the Project Group may materially and
adversely affect the market perception or market price of the Tokens, whether or not such
negative publicity is justified.

There is no assurance of any success of the Project

The value of, and demand for, the Tokens hinges heavily on the performance of the Project.
There is no assurance that the Project will gain traction after its launch and achieve any
commercial success.

The Project has not been fully developed, finalised, and integrated and is subject to further
changes, updates, and adjustments prior to its launch. Such changes may result in unexpected and
unforeseen effects on its projected appeal to users, and hence impact its success.

While the Token Vendor has made every effort to provide a realistic estimate, there is also no
assurance that the proceeds raised in the Token Distribution Event will be sufficient for the
development and integration of the Project. For the foregoing or any other reason, the
development and integration of the Project may not be completed and there is no assurance that it

29
will be launched at all. As such, distributed Tokens may hold little worth or value, and this would
impact its trading price.

If and when the Project is fully developed, there is no assurance that its systems, protocols, or
products will be widely adopted or utilised by its target users.

The trading price of the Tokens may fluctuate following the Token Distribution Event

The prices of digital tokens in general tend to be relatively volatile, and can fluctuate significantly
over short periods of time. The demand for, and correspondingly the market price of, the Tokens
may fluctuate significantly and rapidly in response to, among others, the following factors, some
of which are beyond the control of the Token Vendor and/or the Project Group:

(a) new technical innovations;

(b) analysts’ speculations, recommendations, perceptions or estimates of the Token’s market price or
the financial and business performance of the Token Vendor and/or the Project Group;

(c) changes in market valuations and token prices of entities with operations similar to that of the Token
Vendor and/or the Project Group that may be made available for sale and purchase on the same
cryptocurrency exchanges as the Tokens;

(d) announcements by the Token Vendor and/or the Project Group of significant events, for example,
partnerships, sponsorships, or new product developments;

(e) fluctuations in market prices and trading volume of cryptocurrencies on cryptocurrency exchanges;
(f) additions or departures of key personnel of the Token Vendor and/or the Project Group;
(g) success or failure of the management of the Token Vendor and/or the Project Group in implementing

business and growth strategies; and

(h) changes in conditions affecting the blockchain or financial technology industry, the general
economic conditions or market sentiments, or other events or factors.

The funds raised in the Token Distribution Event are exposed to risks of theft

The Token Vendor will make every effort to ensure that the funds received from the Token
Distribution Event will be securely held at such addresses as directed by the Token Vendor
(“Receiving Addresses”). Further, upon receipt of the funds, the Token Vendor will make every
effort to ensure that the funds received will be securely held through the implementation of
security measures. Notwithstanding such security measures, there is no assurance that there will
be no theft of the cryptocurrencies as a result of hacks, mining attacks (including but not limited
to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, and “selfish-mining” attacks),
sophisticated cyber-attacks, distributed denials of service or errors, vulnerabilities or defects on
the Receiving Addresses, the applicable blockchain(s), or any other blockchain, or otherwise.
Such events may include, for example, flaws in programming or source code leading to

30
(2)

G3)

exploitation or abuse thereof. In such event, even if the Token Distribution Event is completed,
the Token Vendor may not be able to receive the cryptocurrencies raised and the Token Vendor
may not be able to utilise such funds for the development of the Project, and the launch of the
Project might be temporarily or permanently curtailed. As such, the issued Tokens may hold little
worth or value, and this would impact their trading price. The Tokens are uninsured, unless the
Purchaser specifically obtains private insurance to insure them. In the event of any loss or loss of
value of the Tokens, the Purchaser may have no recourse.

RISKS RELATING TO THE RECEIVING ADDRESSES AND WALLETS

The Receiving Addresses may be compromised and the cryptocurrencies may not be able to be
disbursed

The Receiving Addresses are designed to be secure. However, in the event that the Receiving
Addresses are, for any reason compromised (including but not limited to scenarios of the loss of
keys to such Receiving Addresses), the funds held by the Receiving Addresses may not be able
to be retrieved and disbursed, and may be permanently unrecoverable. In such event, even if the
Token Distribution Event is successful, the Token Vendor and/or the Project Group will not be
able to receive the funds raised and the Token Vendor and/or the Project Group will not be able
to utilise such funds for the development of the Project, and the implementation of the Project
might be temporarily or permanently curtailed. As such, distributed Tokens may hold little worth
or value, and this would impact their trading price.

The loss or compromise of information relating to the Purchaser ’s wallet may affect the
Purchaser ’s access and possession of the Tokens

The Purchaser’s access to the Tokens in a cryptocurrency wallet (“Wallet”) depends on, among
other things, the safeguards to the information to such Wallet, including but not limited to the
user account information, address, private key, and password. In the event that any of the
foregoing is lost or compromised, the Purchaser’s access to the Wallet may be curtailed and
thereby adversely affecting the Purchaser’s access and possession to the Tokens, including such
Tokens being unrecoverable and permanently lost.

The Wallet or Wallet service provider may not be technically compatible with the Tokens
The Wallet or Wallet service provider may not be technically compatible with the Tokens which
may result in the delivery of Tokens being unsuccessful or affect the Purchaser’s access to such

Tokens.

RISKS RELATING TO THE TOKEN VENDOR AND THE PROJECT GROUP

The Project is initiated by the Token Vendor and the Project Group. Any events or circumstances
which adversely affect the Token Vendor and/or the Project Group may have a corresponding
adverse effect on the Project if such events or circumstances affect the Token Vendor’s and/or the

31
Project Group’s ability to launch the Project. This would correspondingly have an impact on the
trading price of the Tokens.

There may be weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs in the protocols, systems, and smart contracts
in connection with the Project

As blockchain and smart contract technology is still relatively in its early stage of development
and its application of experimental nature carries significant operation, technological, financial,
regulatory and reputational risks, there are inherent risks that such protocols, systems and/or
smart contracts could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs.

Purchasers of Tokens should understand and accept that there are no warranties that Tokens are
fit for a particular purpose or do not contain any weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs which would
cause loss in their worth or value. In the event that any of the aforementioned risks materialises,
the business strategies, results of operations and outlook of the Token Vendor and/or the Project
Group may also be adversely affected.

The Token Vendor and/or the Project Group may experience system failures, unplanned
interruptions in their network or services, hardware or software defects, security breaches or
other causes that could adversely affect the infrastructure network of the Token Vendor and/or
the Project Group, and/or the Project

The Token Vendor and/or the Project Group is/are unable to anticipate when there would be
occurrences of hacks, cyber-attacks, mining attacks (including but not limited to double-spend
attacks, majority mining power attacks, and “‘selfish-mining” attacks), distributed denials of
service or errors, vulnerabilities or defects in the Project, the Tokens, the Receiving Addresses,
the Wallet or any technology (including but not limited to smart contract technology) on which
the Project Group, the Project, the Tokens, the Receiving Addresses, and the Wallet rely or on the
applicable blockchain(s). Such events may include, for example, flaws in programming or source
code leading to exploitation or abuse thereof. The Token Vendor and/or the Project Group may
not be able to detect such hacks, mining attacks (including but not limited to double-spend
attacks, majority mining power attacks, and “‘selfish-mining” attacks), cyber-attacks, distributed
denials of service errors vulnerabilities or defects in a timely manner, and may not have sufficient
resources to efficiently cope with multiple service incidents happening simultaneously or in rapid
succession.

The network or services of the Token Vendor and/or the Project Group, which would include the
Project, could be disrupted by numerous events, including natural disasters, equipment
breakdown, network connectivity downtime, power losses, or even intentional disruptions of their
services, such as disruptions caused by software viruses or attacks by unauthorised users, some of
which are beyond the control of the Token Vendor and/or the Project Group. Although the Token
Vendor and the Project Group will be taking steps against malicious attacks on their appliances or
infrastructure, which are critical for the initiation and maintenance of the Project and its other
services, there can be no assurance that cyber-attacks, such as distributed denials of service, will

32
not be attempted in the future, and that any of the enhanced security measures of the Token
Vendor and/or the Project Group will be effective. The Token Vendor and/or the Project Group
may be prone to attacks on their infrastructure intended to steal information about its technology,
financial data or user information or take other actions that would be damaging to the Token
Vendor, the Project Group, and/or users of the Project. Any significant breach of the security
measures of the Token Vendor and/or the Project Group or other disruptions resulting in a
compromise of the usability, stability and security of the network or services of the Token Vendor
and/or the Project Group (including the Project) may adversely affect the trading price of the
Tokens.

The Token Vendor and/or the Project Group are dependent in part on the location and data
centre facilities of third parties

The infrastructure network of the Token Vendor and/or the Project Group is in part established
through servers which they own and house at the location facilities of third parties, and servers
that they rent at data centre facilities of third parties. If the Token Vendor and/or the Project
Group is/are unable to renew its data facility lease on commercially reasonable terms or at all, the
Token Vendor and/or the Project Group may be required to transfer their servers to a new data
centre facility, and may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection
with the relocation. These facilities are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among
others, natural disasters, arson, terrorist attacks, power losses, and telecommunication failures .
Additionally, the third party providers of such facilities may suffer a breach of security as a result
of third party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, and a third party may obtain
unauthorised access to the data in such servers. As techniques used to obtain unauthorised access
to, or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognised until launched
against a target, the Token Vendor, the Project Group, and/or the providers of such facilities may
be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. Any such
security breaches or damages which occur that impact upon the infrastructure network of the
Token Vendor and/or the Project Group, and/or the Project may adversely impact the price of the
Tokens.

General global market and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on the operating
performance, results of operations and cash flows of the Token Vendor and/or the Project
Group

The Token Vendor and/or the Project Group have/has been and could continue to be affected by
general global economic and market conditions. Challenging economic conditions worldwide
have from time to time, contributed, and may continue to contribute, to slowdowns in the
information technology industry at large. Weakness in the economy could have a negative effect
on the business, operations and financial condition of the Token Vendor and/or the Project Group,
including decreases in revenue and operating cash flows. Additionally, in a down-cycle economic
environment, the Token Vendor and/or the Project Group may experience the negative effects of
increased competitive pricing pressure and a slowdown in commerce and usage of the Project.
Suppliers on which the Token Vendor and/or the Project Group rely for servers, bandwidth,

33
location and other services could also be negatively impacted by economic conditions that, in
turn, could have a negative impact on the operations or expenses of the Token Vendor and/or the
Project Group. There can be no assurance, therefore, that current economic conditions or
worsening economic conditions or a prolonged or recurring recession will not have a significant
adverse impact on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Token Vendor
and/or the Project Group, and hence the Project, which may indirectly impact the trading price of
the Tokens.

The Token Vendor, the Project Group, the Tokens and/or the Project may be affected by newly
implemented regulations

The Token Vendor, the Project Group, the Project, and/or the Tokens may be affected by newly
implemented regulations relating to cryptocurrencies or digital tokens markets, including having
to take measures to comply with such regulations, or having to deal with queries, notices, requests
or enforcement actions by regulatory authorities, which may come at a substantial cost and may
also require substantial modifications to the Project. This may impact the appeal of the Project for
users and result in decreased usage of the Project. Further, should the costs (financial or
otherwise) of complying with such newly implemented regulations exceed a certain threshold,
launching the Project may no longer be commercially viable and the Token Vendor and/or the
Project Group may opt to discontinue the Project and/or the Tokens. Further, it is difficult to
predict how or whether governments or regulatory authorities may implement any changes to
laws and regulations affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including the
Project and the Tokens. The Token Vendor and/or the Project Group may also have to cease
operations in a jurisdiction that makes it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or make it
commercially unviable or undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in
such jurisdiction. In scenarios such as the foregoing, the trading price of Tokens will be adversely
affected or Tokens may cease to be traded.

The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, tokens, and token
offerings such as the Token Distribution Event, the Project, and the Tokens is uncertain, and
regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Project and the
utility of the Tokens

Regulation of tokens (including the Tokens) and token offerings (such as the Token Distribution
Event), cryptocurrencies, blockchain technologies, and cryptocurrency exchanges is likely to
rapidly evolve, varies significantly among international, federal, state and local jurisdictions, and
is subject to significant uncertainty. Various legislative and executive bodies in the relevant
jurisdictions may in the future adopt laws, regulations, guidance, or other actions, which may
severely impact the development and growth of the Project, the adoption and utility of the Tokens
or the issue, offer, and sale of the Tokens by the Token Vendor. Failure by the Token Vendor
and/or the Project Group or users of the Project to comply with any laws, rules and regulations,
some of which may not exist yet or are subject to interpretation and may be subject to change,
could result in a variety of adverse consequences, including civil penalties and fines.

34
Blockchain networks also face an uncertain regulatory landscape in many foreign jurisdictions
and may, in the near future, adopt laws, regulations or directives that affect the Project. Such
laws, regulations or directives may directly and negatively impact the business of the Token
Vendor and/or the Project Group. The effect of any future regulatory change is impossible to
predict, but such change could be substantial and materially adverse to the development and
growth of the Project and the adoption and utility of the Tokens.

New or changing laws and regulations or interpretations of existing laws and regulations may
materially and adversely impact the value of the currency in which the Tokens may be sold, the
liquidity of the Tokens, the ability to access marketplaces or exchanges on which to trade the
Tokens, and the structure, rights and transferability of Tokens.

Token holders will have no control over the Token Vendor and/or the Project Group

The holders of Tokens are not and will not be entitled to vote or receive dividends or distributions
and are not and will not be treated as the holder of shares in the Token Vendor and/or the Project
Group for any purpose, nor will anything be construed to confer on the Purchaser any of the
rights of a member of the Token Vendor and/or the Project Group or any right to vote for the
election of directors or upon any matter submitted to members at any meeting thereof, or to give
or withhold consent to any corporate action or to receive notice of meetings, or to receive
subscription rights or otherwise.

The Purchaser may lack information in respect of the Token Vendor, the Project Group, the
Tokens, and/or the Project

The Purchaser may not be able to obtain all the information it would want regarding the Token
Vendor, the Project Group, the Tokens, and/or the Project, on a timely basis or at all. It is possible
that the Purchaser may not be aware on a timely basis of material adverse changes that have
occurred. Information in relation to the development of Tokens may also be highly technical by
nature. As a result of these difficulties, as well as other uncertainties, the Purchaser may not have
accurate or accessible information about the Token Vendor, the Project Group, the Tokens, and/or
the Project.

There may be risks relating to acts of God, natural disasters, wars, terrorist attacks, riots, civil
commotions widespread communicable diseases and other force majeure events beyond the
control of the Token Vendor and/or the Project Group

The Token Distribution Event and the performance of the activities of the Token Vendor, the
Project Group, and/or the Project may be interrupted, suspended or delayed due to acts of God,
natural disasters, wars, terrorist attacks, riots, civil commotions, widespread communicable
diseases and other force majeure events beyond the control of the Token Vendor and/or the
Project Group. Such events could also lead to uncertainty in the economic outlook of global
markets and there is no assurance that such markets will not be affected, or that recovery from the
global financial crisis would continue. In such events, the business strategies, results of operations

and outlook of the Token Vendor and/or the Project Group may be materially and adversely
affected. Further, if an outbreak of such infectious or communicable diseases occurs in any of the
countries in which the Token Vendor, the Project Group, the developers, data providers and/or
data consumers have operations in the future, market sentiment could be adversely affected and
this may have a negative impact on the Project and community.

There may be unanticipated risks arising from the Tokens

Cryptographic tokens such as the Tokens are a relatively new and dynamic technology. In
addition to the risks included herein, there are other risks associated with the Purchaser’s
purchase, holding and use of the Tokens, including those that the Token Vendor and/or the
Project Group cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialise as unanticipated variations or
combinations of the risks discussed herein.

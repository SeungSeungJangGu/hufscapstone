Unistake”

Join liquidity pools and stake at the same time

LITE PAPER

Executive Summary

Unistake empowers DeFi projects in their quest for liquidity by
providing new incentives for their Supporters to create Uniswap
liquidity pools. Communities can contribute to a tokens liquidity
in new ways that include guaranteed returns, reduced risk of
impermanent loss, and single sided liquidity provision.

Problem

For DeFi Users

Many DeFi users looking to make returns on their tokens are
torn between providing liquidity to earn Uniswap trading fees,
or staking their tokens to earn a yield. Although staking tokens
often results in a predictable yield, it provides little tangible
value to the token being staked. Although temporarily removing
tokens from circulation has short term benefits for the token
value, the yield is often generated in a non-sustainable way
which can result in the price of the token being worth much
less at the end of the stake than at the beginning.

Providing liquidity, however, is the cornerstone of the Uniswap
ecosystem, and every token needs it to maintain a successful
swap environment. Liquidity providers are extremely important
to the value and stability of the token, but the incentives to
become a liquidity provider do not come with the predictable
yields offered by staking. Liquidity providers also run the risk
of losing their own value when they join a pool as the
proportions of the tokens in the pool change. This loss of
value is Known as impermanent loss and it is a very real
possibility, especially in smaller pools from new projects.

The unpredictable returns and the risks of impermanent loss
are often a defining factor that prevent token holders from
becoming liquidity providers and making the contributions
the project really needs.
Solution

For DeFi Users

Unistake takes the predictable returns of staking and the
important act of providing liquidity and merges them into one.
This allows DeFi users to provide true value to the project
who's tokens they hold while ensuring they get a predictable
return on investment that they are comfortable with. This Is
made possible by introducing Staking Bonuses, which are
guaranteed by the Unistake smart contracts at the time the
liquidity is provided.

Once joining a Uniswap pool via the Unistake platform, the LP
tokens minted by Uniswap are automatically staked in the
Unistake smart contracts for the period of time selected by
the provider. Depending on the pool, the Staking Bonuses a
liquidity provider receives can be in either one token or both
tokens of the pair, and during the staking period the liquidity
provider can withdraw its returns at any time. Unistake, of
course, has no control of what price the tokens will be worth
in relation to each other, but the additional yield received
through Staking Bonuses can help reduce the risk of
impermanent loss.

Unistake also introduces contracts that can totally eliminate the
posibility of impermanent loss between the two tokens of the
pair.
Problem

For Projects

Liquidity is arguably the most import thing for any DeFi project
intending to use an automatic market marker like Uniswap; this
is because, without significant liquidity, a token has no value
that can be realised. The larger a liquidity pool is, the more
resistant it is to volatility and the more comfortable people will
be adding it to their portfolio.

Although liquidity is so important to projects, there is not much
incentive for people to become liquidity providers, especially for
new projects and ones with small pools. Even projects with
dedicated communities have difficulty converting their token
holders into becoming liquidity providers, and only a small
amount ever contribute to the pool. This is the case, even for
larger projects.

Therefore, attracting liquidity providers and keeping them in the
pool is a difficult and continuous task for any project looking to
grow. This often results in projects either investing in marketing
to attract providers with a low return on investment due to the
low incentives, or just concentrating on building their project
without any thought about building their pools, in hopes that
once their project reaches enough people it will, in turn, result
in more liquidity providers.

Neither of these solutions are good for the short or long-term
sustainability of the project as a low pool volume often puts off
buyers and even keeps out other liquidity providers for fears of
impermanent loss or low trade volume.
Solution

For Projects

Unistake makes it possible for projects to begin attracting
liquidity providers with all the objections of the potential
provider being addressed. Project owners can set up their
pools with pre-set goals on how much liquidity they wish
to attract and for how long they wish people to provide the
liquidity for.

Projects have full control of their pool parameters and, once
deployed, they can change their offerings based on market
conditions or their own particular circumstances. The pools
run autonomously, based on the parameters and budget the
project decided on and, once filled, projects can accurately
determine what the minimum pool size will be at any time,
allowing them to concentrate on the fundamentals of their
project rather than wondering about the health of their
liquidity pool.

Attracting providers, which is usually targeted to a very small
percentage of token holders who are already familiar with
liquidity providing, can now be more broadly promoted to

the project's community as the introduction of incentives made
possible by Unistake makes It a more viable option for many.

Projects can even ask their most dedicated community
members to donate to the Staking Bonuses of new providers
to further increase the amount of liquidity that can be attracted.
How It Works

The Tech

Unistake is a decentralized app (dApp) built and deployed on
the Ethereum blockchain to work specifically with the Uniswap
decentralised exchange. The immutable smart contracts work in
conjunction with the unistake.com website allowing anyone with
an internet connection to be able to interact with it and benefit
from its capabilities.

The smart contracts are open source and audited by security
experts. This enables users to be assured that the smart contract
will perform the functions it is programmed to do, and gives them
peace of mind that their funds are safe and not in the control of
any third party.

Using Unistake

Unistake is designed with simplicity in mind and provides a
seamless link between the Uniswap exchange and the projects
using Unistake to attract liquidity providers.

The platform allows users to provide liquidity to Uniswap in their
chosen pair without leaving the Unistake website. Liquidity providers
can withdraw Staking Bonuses at any time during their term and,
once the term has ended, they can withdraw their liquidity and
Uniswap trading fees, restake their LPs for another term, or remove
their LP tokens from the contract to continue providing liquidity as
they would have, had they provided liquidity to Uniswap directly.

liquidity easier and more profitable

than with Uniswap alone. Any project a)

can utilise the tools offered to attract

the liquidity they need, and anyone q

looking to provide liquidity can increase

their returns by using Unistake to join

those pools. To take advantage of these

benefits, projects and liquidity providers both require the Unistake
token (UNISTAKE) to do so. In order to use Unistake to attract
liquidity providers, projects will need to have a Uniswap pair with
their token and UNISTAKE. If an existing pair does not exist, the
project will need to create the pair and lock up a certain number
of tokens to gain access to the platform. For liquidity providers
using the platform, profits derived from liquidity provision attract no
fees by Unistake, but a 10% fee paid in UNISTAKE is required to
withdraw the profits made possible by the platform.
Attracting Liquidity

Creating Pools

Projects looking to attract liquidity
providers can create short or
long-term staking opportunities
via Unistake. This can be planned
ahead of launch or at any point in
the life of the project.

Projects wishing to use Unistake
ahead of their launch can actually
program their smart contracts to
interact with Unistake on a
permanent basis or for a set
period of time.

Projects who have already launched

can allocate tokens from their
marketing fund, team fund or other
tokens set aside to build and grow
their project.

Project Provided PoolMatches

Projects can also add their tokens to a PoolMatch to incentivise
people to provide liquidity, even if they do not hold any tokens.
PoolMatch can be used at any stage by a project but it is an
especially good option for brand new projects who have just
started building their liquidity. This is because it can essentially
be used as a type of offering where the participants get to
keep their initial investment and receive tokens for providing
the liquidity that projects need to get started.
Launch Contracts

Summary

Unistake realises that, for a project

to begin building liquidity, it must first
build trust within tts community. This

is why we planned our token launch

to be decentralised. In addition to using
Unistake, using our Launch Contracts
for our own platform, the smart contracts

are freely accessible to new projects nl Coo
who plan on using Unistake to grow

their liquidity pools.

The Unistake Launch Contracts are a set of audited smart contracts
that automate the process of launching a new token that include
token sale, Uniswap listing and timed token distribution. The token
contracts used by Unistake in August 2020 also provide exclusive
staking benefits to participants that incentivise them to hold their
tokens in the contract while a project is in development.

Launching Projects

Although our launch contracts are ready

for deployment and were used for our own
project launch, the team will be concentrating
on the development and growth of the
Unistake platform before actively seeking to
assist other projects with their launches.

Token & Supply

The Unistake token (UNISTAKE) is an ERC-20 token with a max
supply of 280 million. The token was launched through our token
sale contract (ISO) which stands for Initial Stake Offering.

The ISO contract automatically staked all tokens purchased by
participants and incentivised them not to withdraw them while
the platform was being developed. Participants could withdraw
them at any time during the initial develooment phase which
was set to 180 days; however, if they did so, they would lose
the total amount of tokens they could have received if they
waited the entire term. The tokens forfeited by people withdrawing
their tokens were shared equally between two places. The first
place is the other participants of the ISO whose tokens remain
staked and the other Is the platfiorm staking contract which is
used to create Staking Bonuses on the platform.

Through Staking Bonuses, people who waited the full 180 days
received 100% more tokens than participants who withdrew early.
Team Allocation

The Unistake team is taking a modest share of the total supply,
which will be locked up into the Timed Distribution Contract.
The term of the vest follows the same schedule as the ISO
staking term of 180 days, which is split quarterly. However,

the team’s tokens do not receive any staking bonuses and
cannot be withdrawn early under any circumstances.

Accessing Unistake

The Unistake platform will be available through the Unistake.com
website in conjunction with Meta Mask or any Web3 Wallet.

A fully decentralised version will also be available through IPFS,
(UnstoppableDomains) via unistake.crypto and unistake.eth
The Unistake Team

The Unistake team is made up of a small decentralised group of
senior level blockchain developers and innovators. Between

January 2020 and August 2020, the founding team worked part
time on the project, and full time since the completion of the ISO.

The Choice Behind Anonymity

The decision behind the Unistake team being anonymous is more

of a necessity to protect creative freedom and the long-term viability
of the project, rather than a choice to be hidden. This is due to the
constantly changing rules and regulations surrounding cryptocurrency
laws world-wide. As with most DeFi and many CeFi crypto projects,
there are aspects that simply do not comply with all countries’ rules.
By remaining anonymous, the project protects its right to operate
unencumbered and not be at risk or having to cease operations

due to regulatory changes.

The main objection with anonymity is that it is difficult to trust or
know the team’s intentions; however, within the industry, there have
been far more exit Scams or disappearing projects from public
teams than anonymous ones. We do of course understand people's
reservations with anonymity in traditional crypto projects; however, in
true DeFi, it should be far less of a concern. This is not just because
of the reasons explained above, but also because DeFi requires alll
functions to be performed by trustless smart contracts. Of course, It
is very possible for smart contracts to be hacked by third parties or
malicious code to be left in by the developers, but this is why we
make sure all of our contracts are audited by third-party security
professionals before releasing them to the public. It is Our opinion
that, when given the choice to trust people or to trust code, Code
will always be seen as the most trusted of the two.

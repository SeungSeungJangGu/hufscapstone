Abstract

The purpose of Unibright is to leverage the promises of blockchain
technology for all those driving business. Unibright is a unified framework
for blockchain-based business integration.

Unibright establishes a template based, visual definition of business
integration workflows and serves with automatic smart contract gener-
ation. The Unibright framework wants to enable cross-blockchain and
cross-system connections and provides all system components to support
a blockchain-based business integration process.

This whitepaper points out the benefits of using blockchain technol-
ogy in the field of business integration, and what unsolved issues can be
addressed thereby. It shows why a unifying framework like Unibright is
mandatory to turn all these benefits to account and evolves the details of

the Unibright concept.

1 What is Unibright?

1.1 The Unibright view on the blockchain

The blockchain as a concept can be assessed from different point of views. It
is important to understand the view of the Unibright team on the blockchain
to understand the framework and the constructive applications Unibright offers
and to answer the question: ” What is Unibright?”

We understand the blockchain! as a data structure that is technically im-
plemented in a decentralized peer-to-peer network and offers the possibility to

define and hold both data and functions in single blocks, the smart contracts.?

Some features promised by blockchain technology, like built-in security and in-

formation completeness, predestine it for use in the business integration domain.

1.2 The promises of blockchain technology

We focus on the needs and demands of secure and efficient business integration.
The challenges in business integration exist independently from an implementa-
tion strategy. Business integration is already happening and there will be cases,
where existing technologies completely suffice to meet the demands, no matter
if these technologies are based upon technical knowledge of the last decade or
even the last millennium.

Nevertheless, there has been a demand and a reason for moving on, say, from

1 There is no widely agreed definition of blockchain. Its description is still fuzzy due to the
rapid change in research, knowledge and development in that domain. Colloquially, blockchain
is widely used as an equivalent to Bitcoin, which is certainly as wrong as understanding a prod-
uct like Dropbox as an equivalent to Cloud. In some definitions, a blockchain is characterized
a “different kind of database”, a view which is too broad and technical in our opinion.

In our understanding, a blockchain[1] first and foremost means a data structure, a linked list.
Every item, or block is inseparably connected to its predecessor by the use of cryptographic
methods, which define hash functions on the content of the predecessor block and verify the
result in the following block. This chain is constantly growing as blocks with transactions are
added to it with a new set of recordings in a linear, chronological order.

Technically, a blockchain is a replicated structure, where each node in a peer-to-peer network
holds a copy of the blockchain. Each node performs the transactions included in a block, thus
establishing a decentralized consensus. The blockchain is secure by design and has complete
information about the addresses and their content right from the genesis block to the most
recently completed block. Data wise, a block can consist of variables of primitive datatypes
(the state”) and functions which read or manipulate the current state.

In our understanding, smart contracts[2] (also called self-executing contracts, blockchain
contracts, or cryptocontracts) are simply computer programs that act as agreements where
the terms of the agreement can be pre-programmed with the ability to self-execute. Smart
contracts reside inside a blockchain and enable trusted transactions and agreements to be
carried out among anonymous parties without the need for a central authority or enforcement

mechanism. They render transactions transparent, traceable and irreversible.
a direct ”information-by file exchange” strategy, over a proprietary middleware
solution exchanging self-defined structured data to a cloud solution building
upon industry conformant exchange formats.

We understand the blockchain as next step in this evolution to solve certain
problems and meet certain doubts in the area of middleware- and cloud-based
business integration.

Some of the commonly agreed advantages and promises of blockchain tech-

nology encompass:

Disintermediation
Information exchange between two parties without the intermediation

through a third party, eliminating counterparty risk.

Durability, Reliability, Longevity
Due to the decentralized structure, a blockchain does not have a central

point of failure, hence being better able to withstand malicious attacks.

Transparency
Changes to public blockchains are publicly viewable by all participating

nodes.

Immutability
Transactions cannot be altered or deleted due to the cryptographic link

structure of all blocks in the chain.

Lower transaction costs
By eliminating third party intermediaries and overhead costs for exchang-
ing assets, blockchains have the potential to greatly reduce transaction

fees.

SAP, one of the world leading ERP-software vendors, sums up the blockchain

trend as follows|[3]:

"Every business is based on transactions. But these transactions are often
routed through third-party intermediaries like banks, lawyers, and brokers
which can make processing time-consuming and expensive. Blockchain
technology has the potential to reduce the role of middlemen, dramatically
speeding up multi-participant transactions and lowering costs, while ensuring
all parties are protected. People, businesses, machines, and algorithms would
be free to transact and communicate with one another in a frictionless way.

This is the promise of blockchain.”
1.3. The potential of blockchain technology

Aside from the Hype factor, that accompanies every new technology, the blockchain
technology already yielded its proof of concept and its real-life relevance with
the bitcoin[4] implementation and the Ethereum[5] environment, among others.

Without regard to the use of the blockchain technology as a tool for business
integration, experts agree on the potential of blockchains regarding growth and
distribution (see fig. 1).

grandviewresearch.com{6] predicts:

” The global blockchain technology market size was valued at USD 509.1 million
in 2015 and is predicted to gain momentum over the forecast period. The
blockchain technology is one of the most promising upcoming technological

trends in the information technology domain.”

Million) [6]

As with every new technology, it will take time to establish the blockchain
concept in ”the mainstream”, just as it took powerful and working tools like
Dropbox to solidify a real understanding of the concept cloud to the majority

of non-expert users.

Arvind Krishna, director of research at IBM, states[7]

”[] those companies will be around when the blockchain goes mainstream that
create software that makes it easy for businesses and consumers to actually

implement all of blockchains possibilities.”

He adds an example by likening the blockchain technology to the early days of

email:
”[] even though email technology had been around for years, it still took the

likes of AOL to package it in a way that got lots of people to use it.”

We believe that the demand for smart contracts will continue to grow as
automated interactions between systems, applications and digital individuals is
becoming more and more widespread in our society.

The experience of arising technologies in the past and the conviction that
blockchain technology will find its way into the IT mainstream leads us to our

Unibright mission.

1.4 The Unibright mission

Our mission is to provide the first unified framework for blockchain-based busi-
ness integration. We expect blockchain technology to become pervasive and
therefore want to make the use of blockchain technology more feasible and prof-
itable for those driving real business and not ” only” exchanging crypto curren-
cies.

We are confident to be well positioned to become the first provider for
blockchain based business integration. We strive for bringing the promises of
blockchain technology usage to the next level for business professionals.

We are aware of and are gaining motivation out of the fact that complex
enterprise system landscapes already exist. Some of these will not be touched
for years, paying tribute to the principle of “never changing a running system”.
We do not see this as a defect - quite the contrary: It is an essential motivation
of those standing for Unibright to offer a high-level concept and practical tools
to integrate existing processes and IT-landscapes into the promising ecosystems
of blockchains. We address existing teams with experts in different domains and
want to make it easier for those teams to use the blockchain as one part of their
versatile solutions.

During the analysis stage of the Unibright ecosystem it turned out that we
have to operate on two levels of modelling to achieve blockchain based business
integration a software architectural level and an end user driven application

level. Both levels are presented in more detail in the following sections.

So what is Unibright? Unibright is a unified framework for blockchain-
based business integration and a set of applications leveraging this
framework.
2 Business Integration

2.1 What is Business Integration?

In our understanding, business integration[8] is the use of system architectural
principals, software architecture and implementation to integrate a set of enter-
prise computer applications. It means the integration, automation and optimi-
sation of IT based business processes within and beyond the walls of a company’s
organisation.

The purpose of business integration may be data integration, abstraction
from specific vendors systems to ensure independence and integrity, providing
common front-ends and standardized queries on available data.

In demarcation of related terms, we understand business integration as one
motivation to define business processes? and implement business workflows* on

top of them.[9] [10]

Commonly agreed challenges to business integration can be named:

Message Exchange
Within a business workflow, different parties of a business process will
need to exchange messages. Message formats, the reasons triggering a

message and actions following the message have to be defined.

Notifications
When a message is sent, the sender wants to make sure the message ar-
rived. The recipient may need to inform the sender on missing information.
The notification can be part of the message exchange itself, thus leading

to potential recursive problems.

State Management

3We understand a business process as a collection of activities that produce a specific
service or product, hence to achieve a particular goal in a business context. Multiple parties
may be involved in the business process. A business process can be described in an informal
manner (e.g. as a detailed written concept) and/or be technically formalized (e.g. as a
flowchart). In our understanding, the business process defines the requirements that have to
be met to achieve the defined goal, but not necessarily the technical steps which address these
requirements.

4T™m our understanding, a business workflow is the logical definition of a business process.
The goal to be achieved (as described in the business process) is transformed into a set of
activities, moving and/or transforming information or material from one activity or party to
another. Activities within a workflow are structured and arranged in sequences, which may
also feature parallel activities. The workflow defines a deterministic path through the graph-
oriented activity sequence, including conditions, iterations and the integration of external data,
which may in turn be provided from another workflow. A business workflow is technically

describable, storable and verifiable by a set of rules, definitions and constraints.
Parties have to keep track of already sent messages and notifications, lead-
ing to the necessity of resending messages, update information or cancel-
lation of processing.

Control Flow
Workflows have to be enabled to react on different parameters changing,

by defining control flow with elements like decisions, choices, loops or

exceptions.

Changing Requirements

Existing workflows will have to be updated. Parties have to be added,
system components may be changed and changes in established control
flows may be introduced.

Data Integrity

Different message formats on different parties will need mappings to ensure

content integrity.

Technical Integrity

Different channels, protocols and messages have to be orchestrated to keep

all parties connected to the business integration process.

Security
It has to be assured that the desired partner is reached, data holding

information needs encryption and validation.

Cost estimate
It is necessary to keep track of resources (e.g. time and money spent) to

evaluate the cost-benefit ratio.

2.2 Why and how should blockchain technology be used

for business integration?

During the past decades, several technical approaches to business integration
have been established.
In our understanding, the blockchain technology should be seen as an add-

on to existing middleware® or cloud based® architectures, which have already

5Using Middleware, a central instance, also called the broker, resides in the centre of
the network, and provides all message transformation, routing, and any other functionality.
All communication between applications must flow through this hub, allowing the broker to
maintain data concurrency for the network as well as enabling new connections to be added.

This approach delivers a central configuration repository and enables the applications to
communicate asynchronously, without awaiting response from the recipient. Unfavourable, at
the same time this central instance hast to be considered a single point of failure.

6Using a cloud based software solution for business integration means dividing a classical
replaced outworn point-to-point” architectures. [11], [12]

Looking back on the challenges to business integration presented before, we
compare these different approaches with regard to their ability to meet these
challenges (fig. 2).

Figure 2: Meeting challenges on business integration

The Blockchain as a concept has clear advantages in some areas of business
integration. Still it most probably will only be one part in a complete business
integration scenario, having to be included in existing IT landscapes, of whatever
state they are.

A blockchain infrastructure consists of an independent peer-to-peer network
without a central instance. To be part of this infrastructure and to integrate with
it, every party has to be part of the blockchain, meaning running or interacting
with a blockchain node (fig. 3).

middleware solution into smaller units, that can be run as services in a distributed server
landscape (” The cloud” ) connected over the Internet. These units may provide storage services
like databases, computing, message queuing, caching and many more. Well-designed cloud
based software solution are easily scalable and reproducible, to ensure fast adjustment when it
comes to peak loads or to expanding the services to different areas of the world. The flexibility,
scalability and cost-efficiency promised by Cloud computing has seen rapid acceptance within
many stakeholders in the world of business integration. The dependency (”lock-in”) on the
cloud providing instance or company is enormous, in terms of availability as well as in terms
of security and trustfulness about possible misuse of data and transactions.

In a point-to-point model, a specific connector is implemented for each pair of applications
or systems that have to communicate. This connector handles data transformation, integra-
tion, and any other messaging related services that take place between the specific pair of
components it is connecting. When additional components are added to the infrastructure,
the number of point-to-point connections required (and to be maintained) to create a complete

integration architecture increases exponentially.

3: Including the blockchain in existing IT landscapes

In this setup, the blockchain is monitored all the time for new events or

transactions. To use the blockchain as a part of a business integration sys-

tem, the current

information state of the blockchain can be harmonised with

information from non-blockchain systems like ERP- and legacy-systems.

From a technical point of view, this means existing IT-infrastructure is con-

nected to local

lockchain nodes to interact with them, for example in calling

functions in smart contracts or watching events raised and transactions per-

formed by smar

contracts.

2.3. Conclusion

To benefit from

he promises the blockchain offers, we need a concept that allows

us to integrate specific blockchain technologies into existing IT- and business

integration landscapes, which leads us to the Unibright concept.

11
3 The Unibright Concept

3.1 The Unibright Software Architecture

The blockchain world is still a highly vibrant market, emitting numerous new
cryptocurrencies or even new blockchains in short time.

Despite all the promising advantages of blockchain, there are some intriguing
problems that exist with creating or coding smart contracts today. Generally
speaking, programming smart contracts is complex and error prone and uses a
different approach compared to existing programming for business software.

Today, creating smart contracts for a blockchain platform requires the usage
of a specific programming language like Solidity for Ethereum. For compa-
nies wanting to use multiple blockchains this involves different programming
languages which all come with their own requirements and shortcomings. Fur-
thermore, extending and managing a smart contract is expensive and requires

specialist knowledge, as user friendly or visually oriented tools are lacking in

the field of smart contract development today.

To ensure reliable and enduring business integration based on blockchain
technology, we need a superordinate concept of abstracting from specific blockchain
implementations. This ensures adaptability and an indispensable level of ab-
straction. It also reduces dependency on single blockchains, taking into account
that there will be new blockchain implementations, bringing their own smart
contract syntax with them.

In terms of business process modelling these superordinate concepts already
exist. We do not reinvent any wheel here, but adapt parts of those concepts for
using them in a blockchain related environment: We describe business processes
as workflows, as presented in previous chapters.

When it comes to smart contracts, we need a concept enabling us not only
to abstract from a certain platform specific implementation, but also from the
type of a smart contract - smart contracts differ with regard to their function
or role in the distributed application: A smart contract can operate as data
storage, as a dispatcher, as a state machine, as a factory generating new smart
contracts and many more.

In our vision, a smart contract can be executed in different blockchain im-
plementations and can be integrated in different types of enterprise system
landscapes. Although our current implementations work on the Ethereum
blockchain, our concept enables us to be blockchain agnostic.

To combine these different levels of abstraction, we introduce a combina-
tion of Contract Interfaces, use case related templates and generation of multi-

inherited smart contracts and smart adapters. The basic underlying concept is

12
the Unibright Contract Interface, which is presented in more detail later.

3.2. Unibright Application Level

We defined a set of system components supporting all phases of a business
integration process. This helps us to abstract from the different roles in a
business process, to address different levels of (expert) knowledge and to attend

different execution domains:

e Business integration workflows are designed locally with the Unibright

Business Workflow Designer.

e The automatically generated code is deployed, maintained and updated
as Smart Contracts into a specific blockchain by the Unibright Contract
Lifecycle Manager.

e Existing Unibright conformant smart contracts are monitored and queried
by the Unibright Explorer, using automatically generated Smart Query
Sets.

e Business processes, IT and ERP-Systems in the enterprise domain as well
as other blockchains are integrated by the Unibright Connector. Smart
Adapters using automatically generated configurations enable standard-
ized connections via common technologies. The included Mapping engine
transfers interface defined objects into domain specific objects for further

processing.

These applications focus on business process and workflow specialists, soft-
ware architects, blockchain developers and domain IT specialists in equal mea-
sure, assuring that the particular expert knowledge can be used without requir-

ing expert knowledge in all of the other domains.

3.3. The Unibright Contract Interface, Templates, Use cases

and Smart Contracts

The central part of the Unibright ecosystem will be the Unibright Contract
Interface (UCI):

The UCI defines the main structure, state variables, mappings and methods
which every generated Smart Contract automatically implements, thus mark-
ing a smart contract Unibright conformant. It is the irremovable guarantee of
recognizing smart contracts as part of the Unibright ecosystem, ensuring that
Unibright conformant smart contracts can be found, called, maintained and

connected.

13
Content-wise, the UCI will offer the fundament to integrate smart contracts
into different blockchains and system landscapes.

Operators of the Unibright ecosystem will be able to visually define work-
flows and choose from a set of Templates. Templates pre-define typical business
workflows on a high level of abstraction. By choosing a certain template, the
operator will be automatically given a suitable subset of all available workflow
tool set items and an initial example workflow which can be customized to the
needs of a special use case.

Each template is supposed to bring its own purpose-built interface, which
the generated smart contract will implement in addition to the basic Unibright
Contract Interface (fig. 4).

Figure 4: Inheritation Hierarchy

Technically, smart contracts are small computer programs, coded in a blockchain

specific high-level programming language. These languages will differ in their
syntax, but will share common paradigms of structural and object oriented pro-
gramming. Some of these paradigms will be assumed in our concept to work,
like the existence of primitive datatypes like strings, integers or bools, the pos-
sibility to unite a set of primitive datatypes in some kind of structure (structs)
and to define functions working on these datatypes and optionally returning
values.

The set of templates will be constantly enhanced to serve other use cases

and different industries.

3.4 The Unibright smart contract lifecycle

Smart contracts are enclosed code-blocks, stored and executed in a blockchain.

Unibright will offer standardized, abstract views and control mechanisms on top

14
of any specific blockchain technology to create a set of automatically generated
smart contracts for each specific business workflow. All Unibright conformant
smart contracts will implement the Unibright Contract Interface, which ensures

logical access in every layer (fig. 5).

Figure 5: The Unibright smart contract lifecycle
3.4.1 Defining Unibright conformant business workflows

Business workflows are based on use case specific templates, which include an
adaptable basic workflow and corresponding workflow tool set items. By select-
ing the appropriate template for a business use case the user will be able to
build his specific needs on top of the already existing base logic coming from
the template. He will be able to do this visually, with the Unibright Business
Workflow Designer (fig. 6), so no programming skills are needed. The resulting
workflow definition is blockchain independent, saved locally and can be compiled

to different blockchain platforms.

Figure 6: The Unibright Business Workflow Designer

3.4.2 Generating, deploying and maintaining Unibright conformant

smart contracts

Each template will bring its own interface defining basic attributes and functions
to be implemented by a blockchain specific smart contract. For example, some
workflow templates may include the interface ”Delegable” which prepares the
routing of function calls to other smart contract instances.

The Unibright Contract Lifecycle Manager (fig. 7) will be the tool to gen-
erate, deploy and maintain Unibright conformant smart contracts.

After having defined a specific workflow based on one or more Unibright tem-

plates, the user will be able to compile the workflow definition to a blockchain

specific implementation. At the time of writing the first blockchain environment

to be supported is Ethereum; thus the compilation leads to Solidity code.

After its creation, the smart contract will be deployed to its destined blockchain.

Moreover, an update or adaption of the deployed code is possible. Referring to

16
the example above, smart contracts implementing the Unibright ” Delegable-
Interface” can be marked as outdated and be replaced with a new version.

Existing smart contracts can also be paused or terminated if needed.

Figure 7: The Unibright Contract Lifecycle Manager

3.4.3 Exploring and querying Unibright conformant smart contracts

Those smart contracts being published to a ”real world”-blockchain will be
queried and monitored in a blockchain independent manner with the Unibright
Explorer (fig. 8). The user will be able to see all data and transaction flow of
all their deployed, Unibright conformant smart contracts in one place.

Reoccurring queries, composing information from different smart contracts
will be be saved locally as query sets. Queries might be assembled to views and
also contain conditions. An example for such a specific query in the context of
a shipping process monitoring could be ”Show all containers registered in Hong
Kong within the last month with a reported temperature more than 30 degree
Celsius”.

A first set of Smart Queries is automatically generated based on the use case

related template used for the integration workflow.

17
Figure 8: The Unibright Explorer

3.4.4 Connecting and integrating Unibright conformant smart con-
tracts

The Unibright Connector aims to connect existing IT-landscapes and sepa-
rated IT-systems to the blockchain world. Smart Adapters encapsulate com-
munication technologies to different target platforms (ERP systems or other
blockchains) via different channels (RFC, REST, SOAP, WebServices [13], ...).
Their initial configuration will be automatically generated based on the systems
designed in the basic workflow.

Off-chain systems, like SAP ERP or SAP PI, can be connected to be part
of blockchain based business integration. For example, programs residing in a
SAP-System will be able to call functions in Unibright conformant smart con-
tracts, using the standardized communication channels offered by the suitable
Smart Adapter (fig. 9).

3.4.5 Orchestrating Unibright workflows - Cross Blockchain Busi-

ness Integration

As explained above, visually defined workflows will be automatically rendered
into platform specific smart contracts. Multiple workflows might be orchestrated
to a complete business integration scenario by automatically rendered smart
adapter configurations. This will enable integration scenarios with more than

one blockchain involved (fig. 11).

Figure 11: Orchestrating workflows

For example, a global player demands to set up a private blockchain in a
non-trustful environment. The smart contract implementing the (partial) busi-
ness workflow defined for this area can be connected to the company’s ERP
system. This system may be connected to another (public) blockchain, holding
another Unibright smart contract. Both smart contracts are generated automat-
ically out of visually defined workflows, even if they address completely different
blockchain implementations. The Smart Adapters in the Unibright Connector
are meant to ensure a smooth integration. Their configuration can be generated
automatically by defining the system boundaries and involved systems in the
respective workflows.

We want the Unibright software architecture also to allow to automatically
render workflows into platform specific, non-blockchain code, e.g. a SAP specific
workflow configuration (fig. 12). This will be subject of further research and

development.

3.5 The Unibright Ecosystem

Striving to be the first framework provider for unified blockchain based busi-
ness integration, the Unibright ecosystem will bundle all components needed to

empower the business integration lifecycle.

e Use case related business objects, conditions and actions are orchestrated
into template based workflows with the Unibright Business Workflow De-

signer.

e A template holds a template specific interface, which is implemented by a
smart contract in addition to the Unibright Contract Interface (UCI), and
is then deployed into and maintained in the blockchain by the Unibright
Contract Lifecycle Manager.

e All Smart queries and monitoring tasks on the smart contracts (by Unib-

right Explorer) are working against the Interfaces, abstracting from the

blockchain domain specific implementation.

e Smart contracts can interact directly with a specific blockchain, or in-

teract with enterprise systems and other blockchains via the Unibright

Connector.

e The Smart Adapters (included in the Unibright Connector) encapsulate
communication channels suitable for specific systems that have to be in-

tegrated.

e The Mapping Engine (included in the Unibright Connector) transfers in-

terface defined objects into domain specific objects for further processing.

4 Implementation Details

The implementation of all Unibright components follows the central concepts
blockchain technology offers. Disintermediation, security and transparency are
foundations of all components. All data and transaction flow during design-time
and runtime of Unibright conformant smart contracts will stay in the respective
user domain.

The Unibright Contract Lifecycle Manager and the Unibright Explorer will
interact with the local node to maintain smart contracts or query contracts via
the Unibright Connector. The Connector is supposed to enable interaction with
Unibright conformant smart contracts by interacting with the local blockchain
nodes residing in the respective company’s domain (fig. 14). By interacting
only with local nodes, we use the communication pattern that most of the

applications interacting with blockchain use, like wallets or mining software.

Figure 14: Business Integration with Unibright system components

For a company leveraging the Unibright framework there is no trust needed
for a third party. The company can keep total control of all the information
and data used.

Currently the Unibright system components are focusing the Ethereum envi-
ronment, using the web3.js library for communicating with the local blockchain
node. Other blockchain technologies will be evaluated and added to the Unib-

right framework as they gain market relevance.

5 Examples for blockchain based business inte-

gration with the Unibright Framework

This section illustrates some examples of real-world business integration scenar-
ios which could benefit from the outstanding advantages of blockchain technol-
ogy and the Unibright framework.

We envisage that all use cases can be implemented by setting up on Unibright
workflow templates. The designed workflows result in automatically rendered
Unibright conformant smart contracts for various blockchains which then can

be connected to off-chain IT landscapes.

5.1 Get Quotation for Material

(Request for Quotation-Template)

5.1.1 Challenge

A purchaser needs to reorder a certain material. The requirement is determined

in the purchasers backend ERP-System.

5.1.2. Unibright solution

A Unibright conformant smart contract will trigger potential suppliers to get
a quotation on the required material, providing additional information like the
requested quantity, a desired delivery date and a proposed prime cost.
Potential suppliers will be able to decide on the offer by direct interaction
between Unibright conformant smart contracts (e.g. neglecting all Requests
under a certain volume) or integrating an off-chain backend system via the

Unibright connector (e.g. starting capacity planning workflows in SAP).

5.1.3 Envisaged benefits using the Unibright framework

The blockchain technology enables automatic interaction between different smart

contracts without intermediation, secure and reproducible. The compatibility

to the Unibright Contract Interface would allow these smart contracts to be

connected to enterprise systems.

5.2 Product Pass Approval

(Multi Party Approval-Template)

24
5.2.1 Challenge

A jewellery company develops new necklaces which are about to be manufac-
tured abroad, and then distributed by the company-owned web shop. The
approval process involves different departments and consists of different steps.
Some of these steps are dependent on the fulfilment of other steps, and some

are accomplishable independently.

5.2.2 Unibright solution

Unibright conformant smart contracts interact by setting states of their respec-
tive approval. The current state of the approval process is accumulated in a
central smart contract which holds the control flow and implicitly decides on

the final approval state.

5.2.3 Envisaged benefits using the Unibright framework

The current state of the approval workflow is implicitly represented by the
available blocks in the blockchain. The blockchain acts as a state-machine:
secure, reliable and deterministic. The Unibright Explorer can be frequently
used to check the current state of the approval process, showing the complete

information flow of all participating parties.

5.3 Shipping Process Monitoring

(Data Collector-Template)

5.3.1 Challenge

In an Internet of Things (IoT)[14] enabled plant, different types of sensors on
trucks, machines and containers deliver information on the current state of a
shipping process. These pieces of information have to be collected and displayed

properly.

5.3.2. Unibright solution

The different actors interact with Unibright conformant smart contracts to up-
date the ongoing shipping process and show the respective states of the involved

entities.

5.3.3 Envisaged benefits using the Unibright framework

The blockchain acts as an immutable data keeper, secure and reliable. The

Unibright Explorer can be used to supervise the ongoing process, improving the
speed of analysis and the quality of tracking.

5.4 Tracking of resources during a production process

(Batch tracing-Template and Data Collector-Template)

5.4.1 Challenge

A manufacturing company in the food industry wants to enable backtracking
of all raw materials used in a final product, a bottled lemonade. Parts of this
production process are the mixing of basic ingredients delivered by different sup-
pliers and identified by electronically readable lot numbers. The final product
is bottled and sold in various tray combinations to resellers and restaurants. By
the mention of a unique identifier on each sold tray combination the company

wants to be able to name all original lots of the raw materials.

5.4.2 Unibright solution

All goods receipts, their usage in the production process and their merging into
the final product are inserted into the blockchain as Unibright conformant smart

contracts.

5.4.3 Envisaged benefits using the Unibright framework

Locally storable query sets in the Unibright Explorer enable the user to find
specific information about lot usage in the production process. The blockchain
is both acting as data keeper and as a state machine representing the current

state of a production process.

5.5 Invoice release

(Multi Party Approval-Template)

Once an Invoice with all its information is entered into the Unibright confor-
mant smart contract, the contract analyses the invoice, decides which approvals
are needed and interacts with other smart contracts to request the needed ap-

provals.

5.6 Aircraft Production History

(Asset Lifecycle-Template)
The Unibright conformant smart contracts generated for this business case
enable the user to keep track of ownership transferals, maintenance and repair

history and logs special events like damages or refurbishments in the complex

26
lifecycle of an aircraft production. For all parties getting in touch with the final
product (e.g. the airline using the aircraft to offer a specific flight) the safety

and reliability of the involved aircraft is traceable in a trustworthy environment.

5.7 New Hire

(Multi Party Approval-Template and Project Management-Template)

The Unibright conformant smart contract gathers required information on
the applicant (a ”background check”) and decides upon pre-defined rules and
additionally requested data if an applicant qualifies for a personal interview.
The smart contract can trigger notifications, request needed approvals and au-
tomatically send confirmations to the applicants and the Human Resource De-

partment.

5.8 Insurance claim processing

(ClaimProcessing-Template)

The Unibright conformant smart contract performs error checking, initiates
approval workflows and calculate pay-outs based on the claim, the underlying
policy and the event occurring. Based on this template the smart contract can
even pay out automatically against the insurable event without the policyholder

having to a make a claim or the insurer having to administer the claim.

5.9 Milestone based project payment

(Milestone Payment-Template)

The Unibright conformant smart contract continuously checks defined mile-
stone conditions for payments that should be made. This enables all parties
involved in a project to agree upon a payment plan based on terms that are

executed reliably by the Unibright conformant smart contract.

5.10 ...and many more

More business integration challenges could be met by deriving workflows from
a growing number of Unibright templates. Updates will be presented on the
Unibright website and the corresponding blog. The shared underlying concept

of the Unibright Contract Interface ensures maintainability and connectivity.

6 Outlook

This document described the Unibright framework for blockchain based busi-

ness integration. All the components needed for the complete business integra-

27
tion lifecycle have been presented and are available for usage in the Ethereum
blockchain. The Unibright Connector enables ERP-Systems, third-party legacy
systems and custom build software to be part of the Unibright framework. The
foundation laid constitutes a complete ecosystem ready to be used for workflows
using blockchain technology.

Regarding the implementation, we have to harden our technology to guar-
antee the top quality level we want to offer. Besides improving our existing
components, we will create new templates for use cases we identify in different
industries. In the medium term we aim to support other blockchain technologies
besides Ethereum, like Stratis[15], NEO[16], Hyperledger Fabric{17], or what-
ever will arise in this vibrant technological environment.

The next steps to become the first and leading provider for blockchain based

business integration are:
e Quality assurance of the existing components
e Create templates for use cases requested and identified
e Support other blockchain technologies besides Ethereum

e Develop new smart adapters

7 Token Sale

7.1 General

The Token Generation Event will create and distribute 150 million Unibright
Tokens. The Unibright Token is a token empowering the Unibright Framework:

e Unibright Token will be the only payment option to register Unibright
conformant smart contracts. Only registered contracts can be published,

maintained and queried using the Unibright framework.

e Unibright Token will be the only way of payment for our additional ser-
vices, for example using the smart adapters provided by the Unibright
connector to integrate existing ERP-Systems to the blockchain.

We plan to start the token sale on April 20th 2018 at 1:00 PM UTC (14:00
CET) and it will last for at most 4 weeks, ending on May 20th 2018 1:00 PM

UTC or ending instantly when all tokens are sold.

The token sale will be managed by Ambisafe Financial (ambisafe-financial.com),

7.5 Token Compliance and regulation

Unibright is working with outside legal counsel to ensure compliance with rele-
vant laws in its home jurisdiction, Germany, and internationally. Our goal is to
be as compliant as possible within such a regulatory environment. Please note
though that the national and international regulatory framework of blockchain
and distributed ledger technology in general and related applications is in the
process of being clarified and might change. It is possible that the interpretation
and application of existing laws and regulations may be amended or adapted

and could also be subject to legislative initiatives at national and international

evel. Clarification of and changes to the regulatory framework could adversely

affect the Unibright, its products and Unibright Tokens without us having in-

fluence on such developments. That said, the contents of this document do not
constitute legal advice and we encourage prospective purchasers with concerns
to consult with an attorney. We expect the regulatory environment to evolve

as the cryptocurrency space matures.

7.6 Knowledge required

The purchaser of Unibright Tokens undertakes that she/he understands and
has significant experience of tokens, blockchain systems and services, and that
she/he fully understands the risks associated with the token sale as well as the
mechanism related to the use of tokens (incl. storage). Unibright shall not be
responsible for any loss of Unibright Tokens or situations making it impossible
to access Unibright Tokens, which may result from any actions or omissions of
the user or any person undertaking to acquire Unibright Tokens as well as in

case of hacker attacks or any other events.

7.7 Risks

Acquiring Unibright Tokens and storing them involves various risks, in particu-
lar the risk that Unibright may not be able to launch its operations and provide
the envisaged services. Therefore, and prior to acquiring Unibright Tokens any
user should carefully consider the risks, costs and benefits of acquiring Unibright
Tokens in the context of the token sale and, if necessary, obtain any indepen-
dent advice in this regard. Any interested person who is not in the position to

accept or to understand the risks associated with purchase, holding and use of

30
Unibright Tokens as indicated in the Terms & Conditions of the token sale and

further unknown and unforeseeable risks should not acquire Unibright Tokens.

1 Introduction

Mossland is a gaming platform centered around virtual properties of landmarks from the real world.
Mossland utilizes the in-game currency Moss Coin (MOC), an ERC-20 based cryptocurrency, to run the
in-game economy.

Through the platform, virtual properties are bought and sold, auctions are conducted, and
accessories can be created in the form of ERC-721 tokens. The effort users put into a virtual property
(upgrading a virtual property, applying accessories, increasing user check-ins etc.) can also be stored in
the ERC-721 format or in an advanced form of blockchain technology. Users will have a simultaneous
ownership of virtual properties and accessories in all the services under the Mossland platform.

Instead of making an individual gaming environment with their own virtual properties and
ownerships, game producers will have access to a market with a sufficient number of users and a
convenient virtual property trading system by choosing Mossland as their platform to develop their
own services.

If a new blockchain technology with higher performance and correspondingly lower transaction fees
is introduced after Mossland is launched, Mossland may be converted to a blockchain-based platform
and all Mossland’s assets would then become on-blockchain assets.

Mossland: The Auction - Virtual Landmark Auction Service

Mossland: The auction is an auction service where users can trade virtual landmarks, the core assets
of the Mossland Platform. Users can participate in the auction to win landmarks provided by Mossland
and eventually resell them to other users for Moss Coin (MOC) through the open auction. Transactions
in Mossland: The Auction are executed using Moss Coin, Mossland’s blockchain-based cryptocurrency.
The service was launched in October 2018.

Mossland: The Hunters - Location Based Treasure Hunt Service

Mossland: The Hunters is a location-based service (LBS) in the form of a treasure hunt centered on
the virtual landmarks and buildings that can be earned by participating in Mossland: The Auction. Users
will be able to collect various items distributed throughout the map which can be exchanged to goods.
Mossland and landmark owners can earn advertisement fees by hosting advertisements from hosts in
Mossland’s world or their own property. The advertisement fee (usually Moss Coin in this case) will be
divided among Mossland, the owner of the landmark and users who watch the advertisement. As users
seek for treasures, they will naturally be exposed to the advertisements, resulting in a high overall
conversion rate.

Mossland: The Auction and Mossland: The Hunters are services under the Mossland Platform which
means that they use the same virtual property values. In one aspect, these two services can be seen as
the alpha versions of Mossland: The City as it will be released in advance to pre-validate some main
features of Mossland: The City to improve game quality and broaden the initial user base.

Mossland: The City - Virtual Landmark Management and Gaming Service

Mossland: The City is a location-based gaming service focused on collecting and managing virtual
landmarks. Upon winning a landmark in Mossland: The Auction, landmark owners can manage their
buildings by controlling various features such as decorating their properties with digital accessories.
Users can also communicate with other landmark owners or users by chatting and checking into
buildings etc.

As our player base expands and service launches in various countries, the virtual property market
will continue to expand with new landmarks and functions such as accessories and gradually increase
the engagement of third-party contributors using Mossland’s ecosystem.

2.1 Property Trading and Currency

Mossland: The Auction provides an auction and in-game currency system which enables users to
trade virtual properties among themselves. With the implementation of such features, developers may
be able to easily create games where users can deal with virtual assets. This can be implemented on
games that need an auction system and provide an easier environment for Mossland and third-party
developers to make games based on landmarks and assets.

Trading

Players can buy, sell, and exchange properties with other players in Mossland: The Auction. All
transactions are moderated by an open auction system where no direct exchanges between players are
allowed in order to ensure that all exchanges are fair and take place within Mossland.

Currency
Mossland's economy may ultimately be governed by three currencies: Gold, Gem and Moss Coin
(MOC). Each currency has a different value and a slightly different use case.

Gold is the most common in-game currency which would be generated by the gameplay and spent
by users without any supply control. Players could acquire Gold through check-ins, missions and in-app
purchases. Therefore, the total supply of the Gold can only be controlled indirectly through game
contents.

Gem is a premium in-game currency used for buying premium features and Items in the game.
Gems are only given out through certain events or acquired through in-app purchase. Like Gold, the
supply of Gem is only loosely controlled since there is no limitation on in-app purchase.

Moss Coin is the in-game currency used in Mossland for players to purchase and exchange virtual
property. Players can purchase Moss Coin through cryptocurrency exchanges with other
cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum or through in-app purchases. However, once the total
amount of Moss Coins available for in-app purchase runs out, players will no longer be able to purchase
Moss Coin and will only be able to acquire it externally on P2P markets or through property sales in
Mossland: The Auction. Each Moss Coin transaction in Mossland: The Auction will also have an
associated transaction fee, which will be collected by the Mossland team. Transaction fees will be
partially redistributed in the game or locked in Mossland’s cold wallet to moderate the in-game
economy.

2.2 Location Based Services

Mossland may provide various location-based services (LBS). LBS became popular as a result of the
GPS functionality in our personal mobile devices. Widespread adoption of GPS functionality led to the
creation and popularization of location-based social networks and mobile applications, such as
Foursquare. Users can “check in” to physical locations, compete with friends and other users on the
network to own a virtual version of the physical location.

Following the first-generation check-in services, Facebook and Google began to rapidly integrate
similar functions into their existing social graphs. While first-generation services such as Foursquare,
Gowalla, and MyTown remained popular, the advancement of mobile hardware promised additional
augmented reality functions. Ingress’ s launch in 2012, followed by Pokemon Go's launch in 2016, both
hinted the development of a more engaging and social feature driven AR application in the near future.
Through the lens of Pokemon Go, integration of our physical world with a virtual counterpart started
to become a near-future reality and established the foundation for a surge in AR interest and
development.

Mossland: The City attempts to build on the compelling check-in model first established by services
such as Foursquare, while also integrating many of the collection and gameplay elements found in
Ingress and Pokemon Go. By giving players the ability to check-in, claim, and manage virtual properties,
Mossland: The City is planning to use AR technology. Players are not just incentivized to check-in to
properties more often, but to explore and discover ways to promote their properties to other players,
thus creating a dynamic, player-centric attention economy paired with a more traditional virtual real
estate economy. Put more simply, every aspect of Mossland: The City’s design is anchored by the goal
of creating a more engaging social virtual world.

Check-in

Check-in is one of the foundational actions in Mossland: The City. Players can explore their location
and check-in into any nearby buildings. Players are rewarded with gold or items and can use these
resources to purchase and develop their assets.

While traditional check-in services such as Foursquare are designed to enhance an existing social
graph, Mossland: The City attempts to add more value to every check-in, further encouraging players
to check-in into nearby buildings as often as possible.
Property

Property in Mossland: The City is a finite virtual asset tied to real-world real estate. Unlike Foursquare,
in which Points of Interest (POI) were originally player-registered, Mossland: The City will utilize existing
map and location data to ensure that properties aren't duplicated and can be controlled only by a
single player at any given time. This is necessary in order to create a working property economy in
Mossland: The City, ensuring incentivization of both ownership and check-ins.

Figure 4: Check-in to nearby Property

Accessories

Accessories are digital graphics that can be added to landmarks. Users can add accessories to
upgrade and enhance the value of their landmarks to attract players to check-in. Purchasing accessories
and adding them to properties require in-game currency and time. However, Accessories allow landmark
owners to display their progress to other players by visually showcasing their success on their properties.
This type of boasting is an important part for both advertising their properties and providing new
players with a guide when they first step into Mossland: The City. Moreover, accessories play an integral
role in that it encourages both new and experienced players to actively participate in the game.

As an example, an unmodified Leaning Tower of Pisa would appear to be the same in the real world
as in Mossland: The City. However, if a player adds the “Pteranodon” accessory to the property, other
players would be able to see an AR Pteranodon flying around the tower. As the property owner benefits
from additional check-ins due to the accessory, the owner can upgrade the Pteranodon to a Dragon,
further increasing the benefit of other players for checking into the property and increasing the rewards
the owner receives from each player check-in.
BWM an
Figure 5: An AR Accessory
The physical size of accessories also affects the value of properties and number of check-ins. This is

because digital accessories are based on the player's device’s cameras, which means that bigger
buildings with larger accessories will be more likely to attract users.

Figure 6: Large properties and accessories can be seen from a distance

Accessories are also associated with unique rewards, encouraging players to seek out properties
with specific accessories according to their specific needs.
e

Figure 7: Accessories provide in-game reward in addition to visual effect

In Mossland: The City users may earn rewards not only through check-ins but also by interacting
with accessories by tapping on them. Hereby, accessories become a definite reward factor for both
property owners and players checking in to properties. Each accessory may also have unique visual
effects and animations both in their idle state and after direct player interaction.

Items

Items may be created as an integral part of the property and the accessory acquisition process.
Players may collect items through check-ins, accessory interactions and property ownership. Items are
semi-random and have rarity. The cost of accessories will scale with their rarity, making common
accessories easy to acquire, while the rarest accessories will require very rare items and significant in-
game currency to purchase.

All the services using Mossland will share the virtual properties. For instance, when a user purchases
a building using Moss Coin in Mossland: The Auction, the owner is also the owner of the building in
Mossland: The City which means that the owner can execute owner's rights such as attaching accessories
to the building. Conversely, buildings acquired in Mossland: The City can be sold at Mossland: The
Auction.
2.3 Additional Platforms Compatible with Mossland: Location based P2P(Peer to
Peer) Advertising platform(Mossland Advertising Platform)

Global advertising markets are controlled by a small number of large players with the capital
necessary to afford access to players and markets, making it difficult for smaller advertisers to gain a
foothold in the market and reach their audience. The Mossland advertising platform empowers local
businesses to advertise directly to players in their vicinity, making it easier for restaurants, shops and
other retail businesses to find their targets and bring players into their businesses. The basic structure
of the Mossland advertising platform is outlined in Figure 8:

Ad Campaign on Property

100 MOC Action

Ad fee

Advertiser Customer

Property Owner Game Company

Figure 8: Mossland Advertising Platform, High-Level

Any Mossland: The Hunters and Mossland: The City player would be able to run an advertisement
campaign by paying an advertising fee to the owner of any property obtained through Mossland: The
Auction. However, it will obviously be more economical if the building was owned by the client itself. If
a player submits an advertising campaign to another user's property, the owner will need to approve
before commencing the campaign. All advertisements can be reported as inappropriate or harmful by
players and moderators. The Mossland advertising platform is a CPA (cost per action) platform, resulting
in cost and payment based on when players interact with the advertisement in the specified way (view,
click, visit, register, purchase, etc.). The largest portion of the advertising fee will be paid directly to the
players who interacts with the advertisement, while the remainder is split between the property owner
and Mossland foundation (in the form of fees). Most importantly, it would create an opportunity for
players to acquire Moss Coin without having to spend money on exchanges or through in-app
purchases. This will instigate more players to participate and earn incentives in Mossland: The City
resulting in a greater number of active members in the community.

10
The Mossland advertising platform would become one of the first micro advertising platforms
integrated into services based on virtual property markets. By enabling any player to create an
advertisement on the services, Mossland advertising platform is attempting to democratize access to
customers and enable hyper-local advertising, all of which are a result of Mossland: The Auction. Players
will be able to start, stop, and evaluate the success of their advertisements by using simple management
tools supported in the game.

3.2 Moss Coin Usages

As mentioned in 2.2, players will use three different in-game currencies in Mossland: The City. The
third currency, Moss Coin, is a currency issued by the Mossland foundation. It is used by players for
the purchase and sale of properties and accessories via Mossland: The Auction and to run P2P
advertisement campaigns. Moss Coin can be used in any service within Mossland. In order to use the
services, players have to deposit Moss Coin in Mossland. Then, Moss Coin will be available in the
player's in-game account. These Moss Coin will be securely managed and stored in cold wallets
managed by the Mossland foundation. There are four ways to acquire Moss Coin in Mossland:

¢ Extra-game Acquisition and Exchange
Players will be able to purchase Moss Coin by participating in the Mossland ICO or later at
cryptocurrency exchanges or P2P Markets.

¢ In-game In-App Purchases
Players will be able to conveniently purchase Moss Coin in Mossland through in-app purchases.
However, purchasing Moss Coin in the game will be more expensive due to the 30% fee imposed
by Google Play and the Apple App Store. In addition, the amount of Moss Coin available will be
limited to the amount of Moss Coin that was initially reserved for in-app purchases and Moss Coin
collected by the Mossland foundation via transaction and advertising fees for Mossland's services.

¢ Advertising Engagement
When the Mossland advertising platform is complete, users will be able to receive Moss Coin
in the game by interacting with the advertisements created by other players, or by allowing other
players to advertise on their properties. These fees may be fairly small on a per-player basis, but
overall it will significantly contribute to the flow of currency in the in-game economy.

¢ Property Sales
Property owners in Mossland: The Auction will receive Moss Coin by selling their landmarks.

3.3 Moss Coin Distribution

The total supply of Moss Coin will not exceed 500,000,000 MOC. After all Moss Coins have been
issued, new MOC will not be created. Issued Moss Coin will be distributed as outlined in Table 3 and

Fig 12.

58% of the total coin supply was distributed during the Moss Coin pre-ICO and main ICO. The pre-
ICO was divided into two rounds: A private round for volume participants and a public round for general
participants. The main ICO was also divided into two rounds; a round for strategic partners and fund

To ensure the team's and advisors’ commitment to the project, Moss Coin allocated to the Mossland
team and advisors will not be distributed until 1 year after completion of the main ICO.

In order to ensure that players will be able to purchase Moss Coin directly via in-app purchases in
Mossland, 75,000,000 Moss Coin are reserved only for this purpose. When this Moss Coin reserve is
exhausted, only the transaction fees and advertising fees will be available for purchase directly through
the Mossland’s in-app purchase system.

3.4 Issuance of Moss Coin

The Mossland foundation will collect Moss Coin through the services using Mossland and advertising
fees. This Moss Coin will be resold to players through in-app purchases.

Additional Moss Coin Issuance
There will be no additional issuance of Moss Coin in addition to the original 500,000,000 coins.

Seeding and Redistribution

If the Mossland foundation deems it necessary or beneficial, reserved Moss Coin may be distributed
by allowing in-app purchases of Moss Coin to the players. The price of in-app purchases of Moss Coin
will be determined by the market price when the redistribution is implemented. The store price may
vary compared to the available purchase price depending on live market movements. Additional Moss
Coin will not be made available directly on exchanges, but only through in-app purchases within
Mossland.

4 Moss Chain

4.1 Technical Aspects of Applying Blockchain

Mossland will be developed as a service on a proprietary central server. When a sufficient number
of users have joined the community, user data may be transferred to blockchain. When the performance
is verified and optimized, the data and functions may be transferred to a Decentralized App (DApp) in
the corresponding blockchain.

Transaction Performance

Mossland is a platform that supports the development of location-based cryptocurrency services
which prioritizes player's experience. Transaction speeds are essential to a good player experience, and
current public blockchains do not satisfy the required performance. Specifically, it is difficult to
immediately check whether a bid during an auction is successful due to the slow response of existing
blockchains in the event that there are many users bidding on an asset. This can lead to a sub-par user
experience due to confusion around which bids are successful, why, and how transaction fees are
calculated and collected.

Fees

Transaction fee designs in contemporary blockchains discourage in-game activity and require a
different model for Mossland to operate efficiently. Currently, every action creates information which
must be stored in a new block and added to a given blockchain. In Mossland's case, a new block will
be created for all game actions and transactions which could eventually discourage users due to
excessive fees. Therefore, Mossland will need to utilize a blockchain with minimal transaction fees in
order to ensure that both the action in the game and asset exchange operate in a way that is both
logical and satisfying to players.

These issues have already been addressed in several public blockchain projects (such as EOS), and
we anticipate that a public blockchain platform that has undergone tremendous advancement will be
commercialized in the near future. Until then, Mossland has been developed as an off-chain project in
order to begin the process of growing the player base and to demonstrate the value of virtual assets
in the game's property market. Then, once a proven blockchain platform has been introduced, Mossland
may be transferred to an on-chain project, allowing virtual assets to be leveraged across multiple
projects.

4.2 Decentralization of Mossland

Figure 13 shows how Mossland, an off-chain project, may be changed to an on-chain project in the
future.

Property and accessory information stored on the Mossland server would be transferred to the
blockchain, and resource files stored in the client applications using Mossland would be transferred to
the resource download server. Therefore, augmented reality DApps utilizing virtual assets on the Moss
Chain (Mossland’s blockchain) can be developed as lighter clients, which will lead to a more open
environment where Mossland's virtual assets can be utilized by more services.

Figure 12: Decentralization of Mossland

An AR SDK called Moss Frame may be developed and distributed. Moss Frame reads information
on the properties and accessories stored in the Moss Chain based on the user’s location and camera
information. This also accesses the necessary resources from the resource download server and makes
them available to the player's client application, also giving developers the ability to directly display
them to a player's screen. Moss Frame will facilitate the development of DApps by allowing developers
to easily render augmented virtual world without in-depth AR technology.

Mossland may transform from an off-chain project which handled all the functions with all the
resources to one of Moss Chain’s DApps. It would serve as the primary DApp that best exemplifies the
Moss Chain and Moss Frame to encourage third party developers to develop more DApps based on
the expected success in the market.

Through these steps, Mossland wants to increase the value of virtual assets by releasing its own
assets on the blockchain instead of monopolizing them. Mossland will also support the successful
launch of other Dapps to maintain the value of virtual assets.

5 ICO (Initial Coin Offering)
5.1 Pre-ICO

The Pre-ICO was divided into a private round for volume participants and a public round for general
participants, with a minimum purchase of 0.1 ETH and a maximum purchase of 1,000 ETH. The Moss
Coin exchange rate was set at 1 ETH = 10,000 MOC. A detailed overview can be found in Table 4,
below. The Pre-ICO bonus structure was applied as outlined in Table 5.

The exchange rate for the main ICO was determined based on the average value of Ethereum during
the Pre-ICO and the value of Ethereum at the time of the main ICO. This was designed to protect both
participants in the Pre-ICO and the main ICO. The Ethereum price for the calculation was set according
to the market price of Bittrex1), and the average price of the Pre-ICO was calculated as a median price
between minimum and maximum prices during the Pre-ICO. Since the Main ICO was held over four
weeks, the price of Moss Coin during the Main ICO was updated each day and was determined by the
respective market price of QTUM and ETH at the time of the renewal. Bonuses for Moss Coin purchases
during the main ICO are outlined in Table 7.

5.4 Perks for Moss Coin buyers
The following perks were provided to the ICO participants.

Bonus
All ICO participants received a bonus which allowed the purchase of Moss Coin at a discount
compared to the primary exchange rate. Mossland foundation will not issue any additional Moss Coin.

Pre-Auction for Landmark Properties

Due to the nature of the Mossland economy, early competition on famous properties is inevitable.
To prevent such, Mossland foundation will be the first owner of several major landmarks around the
world. These properties are being auctioned off by the Mossland foundation for purchase by players
via Mossland: The Auction.

Some company-owned landmark properties may be utilized to create Augmented Reality
Demonstration Streets as a showcase for Mossland: The City. This would allow us to showcase properties
and accessories in a virtual property market which players are just beginning to beautify. This would
serve two purposes: To create a more compelling early-game experience, and to showcase how players
can improve their own properties as they play.

6 Market Insights

6.1 Location-based Check-in app

When GPS technology became a core component in most smartphones, many location-based apps
and networks were created. These include Foursquare, Latitude, Loopt, Gowalla and many others.
Foursquare was the market leader before giants such as Facebook and Google introduced check-in
features to their existing social networks. As a result, Foursquare’s usage is in decline.

Once the market leader, Foursquare’s success and progress served as inspiration for the vision of
Mossland: The City. By focusing on a simple action of rather than extensive gamification, Foursquare
was able to grow rapidly and hold ground against Facebook Places. However, as Facebook continued
to position itself as an integrated social networking service, using another app only to check-in became
inconvenient. Pressure from Facebook Places in the social space, along with Yelp and other check-in
applications meant that Foursquare’ s simple mechanics were no longer sufficient to drive engagement.

Mossland: The City is a vision that attempts to combine the best of both strategies: A simple, proven
core interaction loop in check-in, and a more complex layer of gameplay that promotes many forms of
player-player interaction and market engagement. Players are rewarded for their participating with in-
game rewards and driven to achieve and to optimize their gameplay experience by owning and
improving properties. This focus on player-centric engagement differentiates Mossland: The City from
other social networks or simple check-in services by putting the player at the center of the experience
and giving them the ability to explore, achieve, and interact with other players in a way that is both
rewarding and engaging.

6.2 Item Trading Market

In-game item trading markets have a long history in online gaming. In the beginning, the value of
digital game items was questionable, but players often created ways to trade them online. In spite of
this, many countries banned sales or trades of digital game items due to similarities with online
gambling.

One of the most well-known cases of regulation around real-money auction houses and digital item
sales took place in South Korea, with the release of Diablo Ill. Activision-Blizzard originally planned to
support a real money auction house in Diablo Ill in South Korea. However, the Korean Game Rating
and Administration Committee classified the auction house as online gambling and regulating it

24
accordingly. After a long dispute, the release of Diablo III was finally approved, but only after Activision-
Blizzard removed the real-money auction house from the game in South Korea.

However, the Korean Supreme Court has ruled digital game items in NCsoft’s Lineage as legitimate
assets, which can be rewarded in exchange of long hours of digital labor and time. But virtual item
trading for real money when purchases are governed by any random probability or unlocks is classified
as online gambling and therefore illegal in South Korea. Therefore, most gaming companies do not
support game item trading with real money to avoid the legal risk of having their games classified as
online gambling. In the meantime, 3rd party game item trading platforms such as Itembay support
item trading between players users and collect a transaction fee. Due to the lack of safety and security,
there are many cases of fraud.

Although some countries restrict, and the others allow in-game item trading for real money, the
overall market size is substantial and has great growth potential. It is no secret that Planet Calypso in
Entropia Universe was sold for $6,000,000 USD. Entropia Universe supports real money game item trading.

The primary advantage of using a cryptocurrency-based system to manage transactions in Mossland
is that it ensures secure transactions among players and between all parties using Moss Coin and
players. These secured transactions do not only ensure the prevention of loss or theft of in-game items
but also the verification of a purchase.

In such circumstances, introduction of cryptocurrency using blockchain technology can be a game
changer in digital game item trading market. Cryptocurrency do not have a country of issuance nor a
concept of nationality and only cryptocurrency owners are bound to be responsible in the country
where they withdraw to the fiat money. Service operation company’ s role is only to issue the
cryptocurrency. Withdrawal of game money to fiat money can be externalized through cryptocurrency
exchanges and secured by blockchain technology.

Mossland envisions a service that can securely and safely enable digital game item trading and
exchanging using cryptocurrency and help players avoid using unreliable or dangerous 3rd _ party
platforms.

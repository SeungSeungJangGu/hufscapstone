1 Introduction

In this information age we often succumb to
the illusion that because information is read-
ily available, it can never be altered or lost.
This is foundationally untrue [7]. While, in
the internet, uilt a monumental
system of decentralised information dissem-
ination, we have yet to build a correspond-
ing system of permanent knowledge storage.
Modern history is full of examples of the de-
struction and loss of vital information, from
fires at libraries and archives [9, 10, 3, 8], to
book burning in authoritarian states [12, 11].
When we look up information on the inter-
net, we are depending on being allowed ac-
cess to centralised stores of that data. Ac-
cess to the servers that hold this informa-
tion can be revoked by their owners at any
time. Similarly, as serving information on
the internet requires the paying of server and
upkeep costs, websites can often simply dis-
appear when funds are no longer available.

we have

Further still, a number of governments are
taking increasing steps to censor and remove
access to politically sensitive information on
the internet [13, 5, 4]. Equally with media
and news organizations, where we once held
physical and irrevocable copies, we now sim-
ply access the information and then discard
it. It has become commonplace for media
organisations to update the contents of their
articles over time. While this provides a num-
ber of advantages over the previous system,
most prominently, the ability to disseminate
real-time updates about unfolding situations,
it also allows important context to be lost or
become obscured.

2 Background

All blockchain innovations sit on the shoul-
ders of giants, including Bitcoin itself, a sym-
phony of data structures, distributed net-
working and cryptography. We too have
sought to further the space, solving spe-
cific shortcomings of existing blockchain net-
works, namely storage, and along the way a
novel approach to transaction speeds. Most
blockchain technologies today insist that a
” full node” must maintain a copy of the entire
blockchain in order to verify future transac-
tions. While the Merkle data structures that
make this possible are in and of themselves
an impressive feat and add a layer of unparal-
leled security, we feel that some performance
enhancements around this process could re-
duce the burden of synchronization for a full
node. We present in section 4 several tech-
nologies that address block, node, and wallet

synchronization.

The full blockchain requirement is per-
haps even more of a hindrance for exist-
ing blockchain technologies when it comes to
storing data. In the case of Ethereum, a
decentralised world computer, storage is in-
credibly costly using their native token. Ar-
weave’s primary motivation is to make per-
manent, immutable storage a reality, in the
same way it is represented in Ethereum.
However, high fees make this storage increas-
ingly impractical. While it is possible to store
data on the Ethereum, previous attempts
have been impractical due to data storage
costs.
Other blockchain technologies have focused
on improving consensus algorithms between
nodes, notably Stellar Lumens, and dPos ar-
chitectures such as Ark and Neo. While this
may improve transaction speeds, the burden
of storage still remains the long term hurdle
many of these networks will face. By focusing
on solving storage first, we have experienced
several performance enhancements that can
be applied to facilitate high-throughput cur-
rency transactions.

3 Motivation

We have designed and implemented a
blockchain network where permanent, low
cost storage is a reality. Weaving stor-
age access into consensus, combined with
novel approaches to transaction bundling
and arbitrarily sized blocks, creates a high-
throughput cryptocurrency that improves on
other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin [10] and

Ethereum [12]. In the past, archives (inter-
net or otherwise) have typically been main-
ained by a single institution (or even indi-
vidual), making them vulnerable to two pri-
mary forms of manipulation. The first of
shese is through the modification of docu-
ments during their storage [2]. The second is
chat the documents could have been forged
or modified prior to their entry into storage
1]. For example, the many works attributed

penned by his disciples [6].
oth of these problems. Once the document
is stored on the weave, it is cryptographically
linked with every other block on the weave.
This ensures that any attempt to change the
contents of the document will be detected and
rejected by the network. In this way, no sub-
version of the information on the weave is
possible. Arweave is a browsable sister net-
work to the internet, providing the long-term,
permanent data storage features that the in-
ternet desperately needs but currently lacks.

A critical component of the Arweave sys-
tem is designed for developers to easily build
applications that interface with, create, and
use data from the network. These apps, built
with a language agnostic REST API, will act
as a node in the network that listen to the
The functions of these apps will be
wide and varied, from decentralised and im-
mutable networks to discussion web-
sites and aggregators. In order to sub-
mit information to the weave, a small number
of tokens will be required. These tokens will
be used to pay miners for their work in main-
taining the weave and network, as well as dis-
incentivizing the propagation of spam. This

news

represents a great improvement over typical
centralized storage systems. Similarly, it em-
powers individuals to ensure that the infor-
mation they personally care about will be
perpetuated into the future. The incentive to
maintain the weave also increases as the net-
work and documents will reinforce the value
of the tokens. As these effects compound, we
expect Arweave tokens to become a valuable
asset for the information age; inseparably and
intrinsically linked to a vast trove of impor-
tant documents.

4 Technology

Arweave is built on four core technologies
that work together to create low cost, high-
throughput, permanent storage on a new
blockchain. These innovations are:

e Blockweave

e Proof of Access
e Wildfire

e Blockshadows

While these technologies are intertwined,
each plays a pivotal role in creating a new
type of network suited for both fast transac-
tions and low cost permanent storage.

4.1 Blockweave

A well known property of most blockchains is
that every block must be stored to participate
in validating transactions as a “full node”.
This is not the case with Arweave.

Instead, Arweave introduces two new con-
cepts that allow nodes to fulfil key network
functions without possessing the whole chain.
The first of these concepts is the block hash
list, a list of the hashes of all previous blocks.
This allows old blocks to be verified, and po-
tential new blocks evaluated effectively. The
second of these concepts is the wallet list, a
list of all active wallets in the system. This al-
lows transactions to be verified without pos-
sessing the block in which the last transac-
tion was used. Using these blockhash list and
wallet lists synchronized by the network and
available for download by the miners, nodes
are able to join the network and participate
in mining the weave almost immediately.

Further, instead of having each miner ver-
ify the entire block structure from the gene-
sis block to the current block when they join
the network, Arweave uses a system of ‘on-
going verification’. When miners join the Ar-
weave network, they will download the cur-
rent block and retrieve the blockhash and
wallet lists from the current block. Since
these blockhash and wallet lists have been
continuously verified through the ongoing
progress of each block, new miners can start
participating immediately without verifying
the entire weave themselves. Full weave ver-
ification is of course available to any node
that wishes to perform it. In this way, miners
do not need to find the previous transaction
associated with a wallet in order to verify a
new transaction. Instead, miners would sim-
ply need to verify that the transaction has
been appropriately signed by the wallet own-
ers private key. To prevent recall block forg-
ing attacks, the hash of the blockhash list is

distributed with every new block.

4.2 Proof of Access

Arweaves consensus mechanism is based on
proof of access (PoA) and proof of work
(PoW). While typical PoW systems only de-
pend on the previous block in order to gener-
ate each successive block, the PoA algorithm
incorporates data from a randomly chosen
previous block. Combined with the block-
weave data structure, miners do not need to
store all blocks (forming a blockchain), but
rather can store any previous blocks, incen-
tivised by PoA and wildfire, forming a weave
of blocks, a blockweave. The ‘recall block’
to incorporate into the next block is chosen
by taking the hash of the current block and
calculating its modulus with respect to the
current block height.

The transactions in the recall block are
hashed alongside those found in the current
block in order to generate the next block.
When a miner finds an appropriate hash,
they distribute the new block along with the
recall block to other members of the network.
This allows the other members of the net-
work, even those without their own copy of

the recall block, to independently verify that
the new block is valid.

4.3 Wildfire

As a data storage system, Arweave requires
not only the ability to store large amounts
of information, but also to provide access to
that data in the most expedient manner pos-
sible. Further, an important part of the Ar-
weave system is costless access to data at the
point of request. Subsequently, the Arweave
has an added layer of incentives to encourage
miners to share data freely.

Wildfire is a system that solves the prob-
lem of data sharing in a decentralised net-
work by making the rapid fulfilment of data
requests on the network a necessary part of
participation. Wildfire works by creating a
ranking system local to each node that de-
termines how quickly new blocks and trans-
actions are distributed to peers, based on how
quickly they respond to requests and accept
data from others. Peers are served in the
order of their rank, with poorly performing
peers being blacklisted from the network en-
tirely. Peers are financially incentivised to
stay well positioned in each other’s rankings
Figure 2: Illustration of the wildfire system. Each node ranks its peers based on how
favourably these peers have behaved to them previously.

so that they can spend the largest amount of
time efficiently mining.

This strongly encourages nodes in the sys-
tem to behave in the most friendly manner
possible to other peers, without cost to those
who are receiving the data, even those who
may potentially be making one-time requests.
Even further, it creates a network topology
that adapts to the most efficient routes for
global distribution, as connections that allow
fast transfer of new data around the system

are prefered. In practise, the wildfire mecha-
nism builds a network topology that maps the
underlying physical connection substrate of
the internet, adapting to changes in its archi-
tecture over time. Overall, the wildfire sys-
tem ensures high speed distribution of new
blocks and keeps data available with short
latency.
4.4 Blockshadows

In a traditional blockchain system, when a
new block is mined, each entire block is dis-
tributed to every node in the network, no
matter how much of the block data a node
already possesses. This is not only an enor-
mous waste of data, but significantly slows
down the rate at which a network can come
to the consensus about a block. Arweave
therefore introduces a new technology, block-
shadows that not only minimises this waste
of data, but enables fast block consensus and
massive transaction throughput.

Blockshadowing works by partially decou-
pling transactions from blocks, and only
sending between nodes a minimal block
“shadow” that allows peers to reconstruct a
full block, instead of transmitting the full
block itself. These blockshadows specifically
contain a hash of the wallet list and hash
list, and in place of the transactions inside
a block, only contain a list of transaction
hashes. From this information (likely only
a few kilobytes), a node who already holds
all of the transactions inside the block and
an up-to-date hash and wallet list can recon-
struct an entire block of almost arbitrary size.
To facilitate this, nodes will also immediately
share transactions with one another, but only
attempt to place transactions inside a block
once they have a high certainty that other
nodes in the network also have the transac-
tion.

The result of this blockshadowing system
is a fast and flexible block distribution sys-
tem that allows transactions to be processed
as fast as they can be distributed around the

network, and consensus about blocks to be
achieved at near network speed. Further,
this system ensures transaction fees do not
increase dramatically when network usage is
high and a theoretical limit on transaction
throughputs on an optimistic 100mbps net-
work is around 5000 transactions per second.

4.5 Democratic Content Policy

To support the freedom of individual partic-
ipants in the network to control what con-
tent they store, and to allow the network as
a whole to democratically reject content that
is widely reviled, the Arweave software pro-
vides a blacklisting system. Each node main-
tains an (optional) blacklist containing, for
example, the hashes or substrings of certain
data that it doesn’t wish to ever store, and
will never write to disk content that matches
this. These blacklists can be built by indi-
viduals or collaboratively, or can be imported
from other sources.

At a local level, these blacklists allow nodes
to control their own content, but the sum
of these local rejections also creates network
wide content rejection. Content that is re-
jected by more than half the network will
not only be rejected by each of those indi-
nodes, but will also be rejected by
the wider network as a whole. This creates
a democratic network-wide content rejection
system that can merge blacklists across a va-
riety of cultures and opinions into a tiny, spe-
cific blacklist of content that is universally re-
viled. This near universal, democratic black-
list shields the network from outside censor-
ship by a small number of actors while still

allowing it the freedom to protect itself in a
democratic manner.

4.6 Discussion
4.6.1 Storage Pools

One potential theoretical attack against the
Arweave that has become extraordinarily
large is that miners may work co-operatively
to maintain a single copy of the weave, which
they all access to retrieve recall blocks. While
this kind of behaviour may at first seem prob-
lematic, this is not in fact the case. If such
‘storage pools’ were employed by a large pro-
portion of the miners, the incentive for other
miners to store rare blocks increases. This
is because if the centralised stores become
unavailable, miners with a copy of the rare
blocks will be highly likely to receive the
reward when that block becomes the recall
block in the future. This self-interested be-
haviour provides a risk-offsetting function to
the network, which scales as the potential
for data loss (caused by centralised storage
pools) grows.

5 Building Apps

Applications using the weave can be built
using a simple REST API. The REST end-
points are HTTP and access the network di-
rectly, such that any Arweave wallet is capa-
ble of reading and writing data. The client
only needs to bring their Arweave wallet to
a website through a Chrome extension or na-
tive application with Arweave wallet integra-
tion, in order to read or write data from/to

the network. There are several architectures
that can be built on top of the weave.

5.1 Client-Server Architecture

Traditional web or native applications have
a client-server architecture. A server run-
ning the cloud will be “Arweave enabled”,
interacting with one or more Arweave nodes,
reading and writing data on behalf of clients.
These services can be websites with clients
as visitors, or they can be native applications
passing client requests to a server operated
by the developers. These servers will need
to maintain a float of AR tokens in order to
ensure that requests for writing data can be
processed. Reading data from the weave how-
ever is still free using this architecture.

Monetization potential for this architec-
ture is simple. A developer will need to ac-
crue more value through advertising, monthly
subscriptions or direct payments for a wrap-
per “credit” within their application, than
the amount of AR tokens they are utilizing
to power their storage. There are many ap-
plications for permanent immutable storage.
For example, storing quantum resistant,
crypted legal case files, identity or medical
records. While some legislation needs to ac-
commodate sensitive information storage, ge-
ographical boundaries and the right to be
forgotten, this can also be somewhat miti-
gated through encryption and key manage-
ment. Several revenue generating models can
be layered on top of the weave, with the pri-
mary value proposition being permanent im-
mutable storage on-chain.

en-

5.2 Serverless Architecture

Applications can live on the weave itself,
accessed by a client through an Arweave
enabled browser. Due to the ubiquity of
browsers and proliferation of web technol-
ogy, it makes most sense to store these ap-
plications as standard frontend web applica-
tions using HTML/CSS/JS. However, if the
client’s native application included an inter-
preter/parser for different languages such as
LLVM bytecode or scripting language like
Python, they could run on the client and
perhaps benefit from the same upgradability
found in web applications.

Developers will not only be able to de-
ploy serverless applications to Arweave, these
applications will also be able to write per-
sistence and provable state to the network.
Since Arweave does not impose a particular
data structure, developers are free to store
their data in the format that makes the most
sense for them. If the application is best
served by a highly optimized Merkle struc-
ture such as the one found in the Ethereum
Virtual Machine (EVM), it can be easily im-
plemented on the weave. If more text blob
style storage is what the developer is looking
for, this is trivial as well.

Serverless applications are extremely inter-
esting as they can write their own data. Lay-
ering on distributed computation will, for ex-
ample, allow the training of neural networks
to store their results, possibly sharing their
resultant models with other nets.

5.3. Event Based

In the early days of Twitter, there was a
thriving ecosystem of cottage industry appli-
cations and developers building on top of the
“firehost” APIs that were streaming tweets
to anyone willing to pay for access. This is
not the case anymore, and in the wake of the
Facebook Cambridge Analytica fiasco, many
“trusted partners” of these services that pro-
vided data analytics to their clients are being
arbitrarily shut off.

Arweave is a decentralised network of pub-
lic data and thus can never censor data ac-
cess or the data itself, with the exception of
democratically rejected content. This means
that developers are free to build on top of
Arweave and can listen for incoming data us-
ing the REST API. As events are triggered,
the listeners will fire the appropriate function
calls of the clients subscribed to those events.
Developers need not fear being throttled or
shut down, as the network is incentivised to
provide them with reliable access to the data
feed.

5.4 Trustless and Provable

Application architectures can be designed
such that information needing to be stored
and guaranteed as tamper-proof are easily
implemented. Additionally, provably fair
runtime code can be stored on the weave
and interpreted directly by the client. Using
the transaction ID of the content, the client
can verify the payload from the weave prior
to computation and be guaranteed that code
they are running is both trustless and prov-
ably fair, i.e. it is the same code that other
clients are running. This opens up interesting
possibilities for trustless random number gen-
erators and other oracle-based services per-
haps serving other blockchain networks.

6 Use Cases

Permanent storage has several use cases.
Specifically, regulations requiring the archiv-
ing of documents up to a certain number of
years. Provable media reporting, academic
research and immutable records are becoming
increasingly important in our modern world
of echo chambers and proliferation of fake
news.

6.1 Authenticity

Too often the legal system is tied up with lit-
igation over the authenticity of documents.
Arweave solves this problem by providing an
indefinite and verifiable store of any digital
content from an author. In 2017, the state
of Delaware ruled to have blockchain evi-
dence admissible in court proceedings. These
records could dramatically speed up disputes
over artistic attribution and intellectual prop-
erty battles. The effects are twofold for
the creative economy, allowing artists to li-
cense their work to others instantly and avoid
frivolous litigation.

7 Conclusion

We have presented a new blockchain network
powering low cost immutable data storage

and a high-throughput cryptocurrency. The
Arweave protocol is made possible through
the use of a new blockchain-like data struc-
ture called the blockweave; flexible size trans-
action block distribution via blockshadowing;
a new consensus mechanism reducing depen-
dency on proof of work called proof of access;
and a self-optimising network topology called
wildfire. Much like the Bitcoin network, our
technical advancements in isolation are not
terribly complex; however, when combined
to form the whole of the network, the emer-
gent behavior is extremely powerful. We have
seen from our testnet results that secure, re-
liable and immutable data storage is possible
on a public, permissionless and decentralised
network protocol. In addition to data stor-
age, arbitrary size blocks make a secure high-
chroughput cryptocurrency possible without
having to resort to complicated consensus
mechanisms such as dBFT or dPoS.
Arweave is tightly woven into the fabric of
she internet through its REST API and sev-
eral revenue generating businesses are being
uilt using the Arweave mainnet. Bridges be-
ween Arweave and other popular cryptocur-
rencies, secure computation, and smart con-
ract protocols will enable a low cost and per-
manent data store to be easily integrated into
che technology stack of decentralised applica-
‘ions. A fully globalized world of information
and financial exchange requires permanent
records. Through a combination of cryptog-
raphy and distributed systems, we have pro-
vided the basis for those permanent record-
ings. We hope Arweave will become an essen-
tial companion to existing internet protocols
such as the world wide web; working with

10
others to build a more open and transparent
future.

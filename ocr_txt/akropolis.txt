VERSION 1.0

Asstractr. Globally, the pension industry is in urgent need of serious reforms. The global deficit between
pension assets held and existing liabilities is projected to grow rapidly in coming decades and risks triggering a
pension-induced global financial (and social) crisis. Furthermore, workplace changes are increasingly atomising
the modern workforce whilst legislative agendas are transferring the burden of managing the pension deficit
back onto the individual. Complex fee structures that lack transparency are further eroding the performance of
pension funds and exacerbating the problem. The Akropolis platform aims to leverage decentralised technologies
to deliver a transparent, accountable and portable pension infrastructure that provides services to meet the
needs of the modern workforce. Industry participants such as Pension Funds and Fund Managers can benefit
from reduced regulatory overheads, access to new (token-based) mechanisms of engaging with clients, and
marketing/promotional opportunities derived from new (verifiable) reputation and ranking systems. Individual
users gain from the improved visibility, auditability and portability of a blockchain-engaged pension platform
that acts as a single source of pension truth for the individual. Furthermore, protocols for accountability
and transparency incentivise good behaviour by institutional participants and reward individuals and/or
institutions that reveal bad behaviours. The challenges facing the pension industry are non-trivial and intricate,
yet they must be addressed. Akropolis believes that leveraging new decentralised technologies to empower the
community to unite and tackle the pension problem offers the best hope for both rectifying existing systemic

failures and building a sustainable future.

the defensive core of a city, a city within a city.

PREFACE

This paper introduces the first iteration of a novel
solution to a complex problem. The authors’ goal was
to construct a document containing sufficient detail to
enable an initial implementation-effort based on the con-
tent of the paper. However, it is understood that em-
pirical testing and analysis undertaken throughout the
implementation process will inevitably necessitate modifi-
cations to the envisioned specifications. Accordingly, one
anticipates deviations from the structures and methods
detailed herein. As such, the mechanisms and processes
described in this document should not be considered as

final nor binding — they represent a considered first iter-
ation, informed by the current capacities and limitations

of blockchain technologies, and the present understanding
of the problem.

1. INTRODUCTION

The state of the global pension industry is rapidly de-
teriorating. Many pension programs around the globe
are under-capitalised and are effectively drifting into in-
solvency. A global discrepancy between pension assets
held and existing liabilities looms large as a major eco-
nomic challenge, both for individuals, whose retirement
will likely be under-funded, and the larger global econ-
omy, which must manage the fallout. Pension funds are
increasingly overburdened by the stresses of increased life
expectancies [1], global decreases in voluntary pension con-
tributions [2], and decreasing ratios of active employees to
retirees [3]. The dire state of the global pension industry
is quantified by the global pension deficit, namely the gap
between existing pension liabilities and assets held. This
deficit is expected to grow faster than global GDP! [4]
and to reach $400 trillion (or five times global GDP) by
2050 [5]. The scale of this astounding discrepancy has
the potential to create a full-blown global financial crisis,

and some authors argue that the severity of this crisis
will exceed anything previously experienced [4, 5, 6, 7].
AKROPOLIS: A GLOBAL BLOCKCHAIN PENSIONS INFRASTRUCTURE 2

The systemic issues plaguing the pension industry are
intricate and complex, though some key requirements
of candidate solutions are readily articulated. Any so-
lution aimed at addressing the pension crisis will need
to support the current pension ecosystem, ensuring that
upcoming retirees are not unduly punished for systemic
failures. In addition, a viable pension protocol must be
capable of supporting the growing needs of an aging pop-
ulation whilst simultaneously facilitating a global inter-
generational transition to a new, economically sustainable
system.

A new pension protocol must also recognize that
workplaces and legislative agendas are rapidly changing.
Whereas earlier generations could rely on the stability of
a lifelong job within a single company or industry sector,
the modern worker must navigate a completely different
landscape. The workforce is being increasingly atomized,
with workers frequently changing jobs (and even careers).
Furthermore, the tendency towards freelancing and the
sharing/gig economy has eroded many traditional mech-
anisms for building pension savings. Workers are also
increasingly mobile, having to move between geographi-
cal locations and different legal jurisdictions, with very
ittle, in the way of inter-jurisdictional support protocols,
available to help the atomized worker accrue an adequate
pension. Traditional pension structures, which rely on
geographic or regional stability, and are often adminis-
ered by the employer or state and lack the flexibility
necessary to meet the modern worker’s pension needs.
n addition, as the discrepancy between pension assets
and liabilities grows, states are increasingly liberalising
pensions and/or increasing the retirement age, to both
reduce pension liabilities and shift the burden of funding
retirement back onto the individual. Thus, the pension
rotocol of the future must be capable of accommodating
existing collective-based pension frameworks, in which
individuals pool their resources collectively within state-
or employer-defined pools, whilst also ushering in the
ransition to an individually-oriented pension framework
compatible with changing workplace and legislative agen-
das. The modern worker requires a pension system that
is compatible with the atomization imposed on workers
y both the modern state and workplace.

In addition to the excess costs brought about by ar-
chaic systems, the pension industry suffers from a number
of systemic problems such as poor visibility around fund
management, unnecessarily complicated (and often hid-
den) fee structures, stringent portability limitations due
to geographically localised fund management, and vast
compliance regulations which, at times, are manually
enforced. Moreover, the incentive structures between end-
user investors, the pension funds to which they contribute,
and the fund managers who oversee the underlying assets,
are often egregiously misaligned.

From a technological perspective, there has been a

plethora of recent developments relating to distributed
and decentralised systems. The advent and subsequent
interest in blockchain technology has radically altered the
spectrum of research and developmental possibilities re-
ating to decentralised systems. In addition to Bitcoin [8],
he subsequent creation of Ethereum [9] ushered in the
era of “Blockchain 2.0” technologies.
Ethereum introduced the Ethereum Virtual Machine
(EVM), which enabled arbitrary calculations to be per-
ormed and verified on all nodes of a network, without the
need for a centralised governing body. This development
was not without limitations. As with most public, fully
decentralised systems, Ethereum suffers from (a) scala-
bility issues which, in-turn, limit transaction speeds; (b)
game-theoretic incentives to break consensus;” (c) envi-
ronmental concerns stemming from the underlying Proof
of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism; and (d) limited
privacy capabilities for concerned parties. A number
of ongoing projects are aiming to rectify these limita-
ions. For example, Raiden [10] and Plasma [11] both
aim to tackle the scalability issues, and the concept of
sharding [12] also promises significant advancements on
his front. Casper [13, 14] is a Proof of Stake (PoS)
mechanism aiming to address shortcomings of the cur-
rent PoW consensus approach. Research into partial and
ully homomorphic encryption schemes [15, 16], along
with Zero Knowledge systems [17, 18, 19],° are being
introduced to address the privacy limitations of public
blockchains. This research is further supported by the
so-called “Blockchain 3.0” technologies, which aim to link
multiple blockchains together to form a mesh-like net-
work. Projects such as Polkadot [20], AION [21], and
Cosmos [22] fall into this category and show promise
for building a relaying infrastructure capable of unify-
ing various underlying blockchains. Despite their current
limitations, these bleeding-edge technologies show great
promise. Importantly, they have the potential to revolu-
tionise many traditional industry sectors and the pension
industry is no exception. In particular, the transparency,
automaticity, and auditability of decentralized ledgers
offers new tools for juggling the competing demands of
workers, Pension Funds, and Fund Managers, whilst si-
multaneously ensuring the flexibility, accountability, and
regulatory compliance required of a pension service.

Akropolis is a new pension platform that aims to unify
recent technological advancements to create a long-term
sustainable solution to the myriad of issues that plague the
existing pension industry. The Akropolis platform aims to
facilitate the transition from existing pension structures
to an atomized, individually tailored pension protocol
capable of meeting the needs of the modern worker. De-
mands of both legislators and the modern workforce are
pressing individuals to bear greater responsibility for their
own retirement outcomes. The Akropolis platform will

provide a pension infrastructure capable of supporting
he modern worker throughout their individual journey in
an environment beholden to changing legislative demands
and workplace conditions. Akropolis will work directly,
and in conjunction with, current leading industry experts
0 iteratively design and build a platform that simulta-
neously supports the current pension ecosystem whils
facilitating the much needed inter-generational transition
© a more robust retirement savings model.

Fundamentally, Akropolis is a global platform tha
seamlessly connects everyday users with a diverse range
of experienced pension funds and fund managers. The dis-
inguishing features of Akropolis include transparent fee
structures, built-in regulatory compliance, stringent fun
vetting and, most importantly, game-theoretic incentive
structures that mitigate the excessive fees traditionally
orne by users in the pension industry.

Akropolis will leverage the unique characteristics an
advantages of blockchain technologies to underpin its
echnologically advanced pension platform. Specifically,
Akropolis notes that (i) the blockchain’s public, im-
mutable ledger will improve visibility and audit trails
relative to existing pension funds, whilst permitting mech-
anisms for maintaining a suitable level of privacy; (ii) the
asymmetric key infrastructure utilised by blockchains for
authentication will allow on-chain (off-platform) direct
communication necessary to facilitate a global system
(i.e., blockchain technologies readily support the global
ortability required of modern pension services); (iii) the
lockchain’s decentralised processing capabilities permit
he development of decentralised on-chain processes to
handle compliance and provide transparent fee structures,
whilst also permitting the construction of crypto-economic
incentive mechanisms to re-align disjoint incentive struc-
ures in traditional pension schemes. Finally, it is also
noted that slower transaction times, often experienced
in a blockchain environment, are not problematic for a
pension platform - typical transaction timescales in the
ension sector do not possess the time-sensitivity of, e.g.,
infrastructure supporting high frequency trading algo-
rithms.

The forthcoming pension crisis represents a complex
and difficult problem. While the utilisation of blockchain
technology is not a cure-all for the industry, it is clear
that emerging technologies offer new solutions to the chal-
lenges faced by the pension sector. Akropolis is partnering
with leading experts in the pension industry and leading
blockchain projects to tackle the global pension crisis as
a community. The goal of the Akropolis project is to
leverage new technologies to develop a transparent, ac-
countable and portable pension infrastructure capable of
delivering sustainable pensions that meet the needs of the
modern workforce, while acknowledging and accommo-
dating the realistic constraints imposed by existing legacy
systems.

This paper outlines the Akropolis platform, its vision
for the future and the complications within the pension

industry it aims to remedy. The paper is organized as
follows. Section 2 gives a high level overview of the
Akropolis platform, detailing its major components and
their connections, and highlighting the benefits of the
platform compared to current legacy systems. The sec-
tions following, provide extended detail into selected core
components of the Akropolis platform before concluding
with a brief summary of the project and its future direc-
tion. A glossary of key terms and acronyms appears in
the Appendix.

2. THE AKROPOLIS PLATFORM

2.1. OVERVIEW

The ultimate aspiration of Akropolis is to develop a de-
centralised pension platform (or more abstractly, protocol)
hat spans a variety of blockchains and delivers trustless
retirement savings products. The goal is to leverage recent
echnological developments and offer transparent, account-
able, and portable pension services for the modern worker.
Due to the infancy of the technologies surrounding decen-
ralised systems,‘ this goal will necessarily be attained in
progressive stages, paralleling technological advancements
in the space. Consequently the initial implementation of
he Akropolis protocol, as described in this white paper,
will be a hybrid of decentralised components managed
by a centralised trusted entity, which we refer to as the
Akropolis Foundation.

The platform will initially be built on Ethereum [9], as
his is the most appropriate currently-operational chain
o supply the service features required of a pension plat-
orm. However, the ultimate goal of Akropolis is to be
a blockchain-agnostic pension provider that utilises the
most efficient and appropriate technologies to deliver
he required services and features. This may entail non-
Ethereum based decentralised chains such as EOS [23],
Cardano [24] and RSK [25]. The blockchain-agnostic goal
aligns with the principles of various Blockchain 3.0 tech-
nologies (such as Polkadot) which could ultimately be the
core underlying technology used for a multi-chain Akropo-
is platform. It is probable that Ethereum will continue to
lay a role in the long-term implementation of Akropolis,
however, it is important to emphasise that Akropolis’ pri-
ority is to deliver sustainable, reliable pension products.
Accordingly, choices regarding specific technological im-
lementations will necessarily be informed by the needs of

ensioners rather than adherence to specific technologies.
Ultimately Akropolis is focused on delivering a product
o the market that meets users’ needs and developmental
decisions will be made with this goal in mind. Nonethe-

ess, throughout this paper it is assumed that Ethereum
will underpin (at least) the early phases of Akropolis and
uture references to blockchain implementations in this
paper will assume Ethereum as the underlying chain.

Specifically issues of scaling, availability of cost-effective decentralised oracles, and stability of decentralised stable coins.

FIGURE 1. Institutional users access valuable data from the Akropolis system, while individual users are rewarded
directly. Rewarding opportunities are created for both institutional funds and developers alike.

The Akropolis platform provides an efficient gateway
between both individual users and institutional pension
funds, and the fund/asset managers who traditionally
manage pension investments (as shown diagrammatically
in Figure 1). The fund/asset manager’s conduct on the
system is enforced through a number of incentive mecha-
nisms to obtain an optimal outcome for all participants.
FMs, who invest on behalf of individual and institutional
clients, build a portfolio of assets which are tokenised
on the blockchain and distributed to investors. Investors
hen maintain a global, portable, on-chain portfolio which
represents their pension investments. The tokenisation
of value within this system allows Akropolis to leverage
lockchain technologies to automatically enforce various
compliance rules specialised to specific assets and geo-
graphic regions. Incentive structures incorporated into
he platform will also be built on-chain, though it will be
necessary for dispute resolution mechanisms and proce-
dures to initially be managed centrally by the Akropolis
Foundation. This arrangement will act as a stepping stone
and future implementations will aim to decentralise these
dispute resolution components, to the extent that this is
compatible with regulatory demands.

Importantly, although an individual user will have a
single account that is tied to their identity, the totality of
the user’s on-chain operations will not be tied directly to
a single identity /address/public key. Instead, the user’s
transactions will be pseudo-anonymous, similar to iden-
tities on various cryptocurrency systems, such that each
new transaction and/or class of transaction is tied to
different addresses generated by a single seed>.

Blockchain technologies are oft espoused for the privacy
they afford users and Akropolis’ philosophy with regard
to user’s data errs in favour of the individual’s right to

privacy. Akropolis will seek to ensure that data owner-
ship is rightfully granted to the individual user. However,
given the capacity for users to leverage their data
cess products that better suit their needs, or to acquire
rewards (i..e., pension top-ups), the Akropolis platform
will provide options that permit voluntary participants to
allow agents of their choosing to access various aspect of
their private data. Data can be exchanged for tokenised
rewards that will further strengthen the individuals net
pension position.

In summary, the Akropolis platform is a hybridised
trust/trustless system that acts as a gateway between
users, Pension Funds and Fund Managers. The platform
seeks to re-align the incentive structures between agents
in the pension sector, while leveraging the accountability
afforded by blockchain technologies to deliver transparent
pension products.

2.2. PLATFORM AGENTS

The present section details the main agents that par-
ticipate in the Akropolis system. An overview diagram
summarising the actors and their interactions appears in
Figure 2.

Individual User — The individual user (referred to
in this paper simply as a user) represents a singular,
non-institutional individual who uses the Akropolis plat-
form for their pension savings. More abstractly, when
discussing elements on the blockchain, a user refers to a

AKROPOLIS: A GLOBAL BLOCKCHAIN PENSIONS INFRASTRUCTURE 5

singular identity which is mapped to a collection of public
keys via a generating seed.

Pension Funds (PFs) — Pension Funds are institu-
tional entities that may (or may not) currently exist in the
pension industry and who maintain their own platform
and collection of users. These institutional funds will act
similarly to individual users on the Akropolis platform.

Fund Managers (FMs) — Fund Managers are institu-
tional entities charged with purchasing or acquiring assets
on behalf of users and/or PFs. They must undergo strin-
gent vetting processes to obtain access to the Akropolis
platform and must regularly report on the assets under
their management.

Asset Tokenisers — Assets procured on the Akropolis
platform must be tokenised in order for the decentralised
components of the system to function effectively. Asset
Tokenisers hold assets, either directly or through verifi-
able third parties, whilst minting and distributing tokens
which represent a share of the held asset. These are
centralized entities that provide a source of truth to the
blockchain layer (through the minting of tokens) and as
such are key actors in the trust model of Akropolis.

Developers — Developers are community members

who contribute to the Akropolis platform, building ex-
tended/advanced services for pension users.

2.3. BENEFITS OF THE AKROPOLIS PLATFORM

The Akropolis platform provides benefits for individ-
ual users, who create and manage pension accounts on
the platform, and for Pension Funds (PFs), who manage
large numbers of pension accounts on behalf of individ-
ual clients. Fund Managers (FMs), who manage assets
and supply pension products to PFs, also stand to reap
benefits by participating in the platform. The present
section outlines the features and benefits of the Akropolis
platform for these different classes of participants. More
details regarding these features are elaborated in the sec-
tions that follow.

2.3.1. USER MOTIVATIONS

From the perspective of individual users/workers, the
motivation for Akropolis follows from three key observa-
tions:

e Firstly, many PFs around the globe are under-
capitalised relative to their liabilities.

e Secondly, to avoid further amplifying the discrep-
ancy between assets held and liabilities, state- and
employee-operated pension schemes are increas-
ingly pursuing systemic changes that transfer the
liability for funding retirement expenses onto the
individual (as manifest by, e.g., the tendency for
pension liberalisation).

e Thirdly, changes in workplaces and working con-
ditions, as manifest by the sharing/gig economy,
freelancing, and the increase in global workforce
mobility, mean individuals are increasingly self-
employed, engaged in short-term employment,
and/or working transiently in geographic regions
subject to varying regulatory requirements. These
changes further exacerbate the problems with ex-
isting pension models, which typically rely on
employment and/or regional stability.

Thus, the individual worker finds themselves increasingly
responsible for navigating a career that involves a series of
short-term employment engagements, often in geograph-
ically diverse locations, while simultaneously bearing a
greater responsibility for procuring adequate savings to
fund a reasonable quality of life in retirement. The indi-
vidual is now, more than ever, a global citizen who cannot
rely upon their employer nor the state to guarantee a
satisfactory quality of life in retirement.

The individual requires a pension system allowing them
to collect and assemble pension savings accrued from mul-
tiple employers, in combination with voluntary contribu-
tions, both of which may be obtained in diverse jurisdic-
tions. If the individual is to be responsible for funding
their own retirement, they require a system with (a) suffi-
cient flexibility to easily function in accordance with the
demands of their working life; (b) sufficient regulatory
compliance to support this flexibility; and (c) sufficient

transparency to permit informed fund allocation decisions,

Future iterations of the platform will aim to support self-
managed pension products (e.g., support direct user-FM
engagement). This functionality is not an initial prior-
ity, however, as only a tiny minority of individual users
are likely to possess the motivation and/or expertise to
self-manage their holdings.

In addition to

real-time feedback.

A decentralized, portable, single source o

Capacity to leverage smart contracts for secure
peer-to-peer lending (e.g., family members can

nated time periods).

e The ability for users to monetize their own data.

e Transparency of governance protocols

comes (e.g., avoids difficulties with fund seizures
encountered in Poland, Hungary and Argentina).
Common protocols for fee and performance re-
porting.

Incentivised accountability and ranking mecha-
nisms for PFs to showcase good actors and filter
out bad actors (acts to revert misaligned interests
in the current system).

Modern products and services that meet the needs
of a generation that is familiar with real-time data
and feedback (i.e., supersedes outdated legacy sys-
tems)
New capital pools, such as cryptocurrencies.
Users can incorporate cryptocurrency assets into
their pension portfolio with options to time-lock
the assets within smart contracts until the user
reaches a pension age. Akropolis will advocate
for regulatory changes that provide crypto-assets
(held in verifiable time-locked pension contracts)

2.4. AKROPOLIS TOKENS

There are two main tokens within the Akropolis plat-
form. The AKropolis external Token (AKT) and the
Akropolis Internal Token (AIT). The former primarily
facilitates functions of external users participating with
the system, whereas the latter abstractly represents a sta-
ble coin and accounting mechanism to track and record
capital flow internally within the system.

2.4.1. THE AKROPOLIS EXTERNAL TOKEN

The Akropolis external token is a fixed-supply token
whose value is subject to market forces. AKTs can be
used for the following operations:

e Onboarding and platform access (see Onboard-
ing/ Vetting)

e Purchase premium services on the platform (see
Premium Services)

e Purchase platform data (see Akropolis Platform
Data)

e Stake in various platform incentive mechanisms
(see Incentive Structures)

A key function of the Akropolis External Token is to
serve as an onboarding utility token that allows partic-
ipants to access the Akropolis platform. However, by
default, the platform will operate on a freemium model,
meaning that individual users can interact with the system
without requiring AKT tokens. All underlying blockchain
operations and system expenses relating to the basic op-
erations of the freemium model will be paid for by the
Akropolis Foundation. This model is adopted to ensure
hat all individual users can access the platform, consis-
ent with Akropolis’ desire to develop a pension platform
o meet the needs of a global community of workers. Indi-
vidual users will also have access to a number of extended
services offered on the platform (see Premium Services),
hough access to the premium features will require AKTs.
We note that a mechanism is required to decouple the
price of the volatile AKT to the fixed stable cost of ser-
vices on the platform. In the initial implementation, a
rusted price oracle® will perform this task.

As the platform matures, users’ data will accrue both
on and off chain’. This data will be valuable to a va-
riety of external agencies and options will be available

o monetise the data (i.e., receive rewards for delivering
, for the users’ benefit (see Akropolis Plat-
‘orm Data for further details). Users that opt-in to share
selected aspects of their data will be rewarded in AKTs.

Various incentive structures are outlined in the Incen-
ive Structures section. These require the staking of a
value-store in order to incentivize good behaviours by
actors within the system. One could use the AKT as a
staking token, however, this exposes platform participants
0 unnecessary volatility risk - good actors, whose stake is
returned in full, may be punished if AKT market volatility
pushes the value of AKTs in unfavourable directions on
imescales comparable to the staking period. An incen-
ivization mechanism that unduly punishes good actors
is unlikely to prove successful as many platform actors
will be risk-averse. Thus, demanding that staking-based
incentivization mechanisms do not create undue volatility
risk for good actors necessitates the introduction of a

stable token.

2.4.2. THE AKROPOLIS INTERNAL TOKEN

The Akropolis Internal Token (AIT) is an indepen-
dent token which abstractly represents an arbitrary stable
coin. Due to the long-term nature of staking, this to-
ken is required to give participants a volatile-free option
when engaging the staking incentive mechanisms (i.e.,
staking in AKTs would subject a staking entity to undue
volatility risks which would undermine the efficacy of the
staking mechanism). AITs also serve as an accounting
bookkeeping tool within the Akropolis system. User’s
funds are represented digitally by AITs (i-e., users acquire
AITs after depositing funds into the system) which can
be converted to other tokens that represent ownership in
different asset classes. AITs can be exchanged for both
cryptocurrency and fiat deposits, and fundamentally act
as an internal accounting tool whose audit trail lies on
the public blockchain.

The AITs are entirely independent from the AKTs (i.e.,
Akropolis uses a decoupled two-token system). Akropolis
opted for a decoupled two-token system as an investigation
of existing coupled two-token systems revealed inherent
weaknesses. For example, some systems use two coupled
okens, with one (volatile) token used to access the plat-
‘orm, and a second (stable) token that is pegged to some
real-world value store (like a fiat currency). Furthermore,
he volatile access token is converted into stable tokens
upon entry into the system (i.e., stable tokens are gener-
ated by conversion of volatile tokens, which ‘couples’ the
okens). Any such coupling necessarily entails collaterali-
sation of some form to mitigate against the volatility of the
stable token. Collateralised coupled two-token systems
have an inherent risk relating to under-collateralisation in

he event of strongly unfavourable moves in the value of
he token. These risks are systemic, in the sense that the
viability of a platform based on such a system could be

blockchain.

cast into doubt in the face of highly unfavourable volatility.
Systemic volatility risks are unacceptable for a pension
platform (and, one could argue, for other existing use
cases) and, accordingly, Akropolis adopted a decoupled
model for AKTs and AITs.

2.5. INCENTIVE STRUCTURES

A core economic principle of the Akropolis platform
is to better align the incentives of all actors within the
current pension system. Specifically, Akropolis attempts
to converge on the idyllic case that fund managers act rep-
utably and reliably on behalf of investors while receiving
a transparent and reasonable fee for their service. Three
main mechanisms will be initially deployed in an effort to
realise the idyllic scenario.

2.5.1. ONBOARDING/ VETTING

Pension products demand a certain type and calibre
of institutional fund management. This is one of the key
roperties that distinguishes a pension-related platform
from an arbitrary marketplace of fund managers. As such,
it is vital that the Akropolis onboarding and compliance
processes, which dictate who is allowed to manage and
advise users’ funds on the Akropolis platform, are not only
horough but also align with pension-based regulatory
frameworks for relevant jurisdictions.

Akropolis proposes an onboarding/vetting system that
requires candidate FMs to stake AIT or AKT. The staked
okens will be held for the duration of the FMs engage-
ment with the Akropolis system. To be commercially
viable, it is envisioned that this stake should be propor-
ional to traditional cost funds must pay to adhere to
standard compliance and regulatory demands during their
engagements with clients; i.e., the FM stakes tokens once
and gains access to multiple PFs and individual users,
alleviating the need to repeatedly incur administrative
and regulatory overheads when engaging new clients. The
overall goal of this staking mechanism is two-fold:

(1) To provide a barrier of entry for funds applying
to participate in the system, to avoid excess costs
in vetting un-suitable fund applicants.

(2) To enforce reputable behaviour once acting within
the platform.

The first point is intended to mimic the logic and be-
haviour of a token curated registry (see the Token Curated
Registries section). Although the initial implementation
will be managed by a centralised Akropolis Foundation, it
is anticipated that, as elements of the platform transition
to a more decentralised structure, this mechanism will be
replaced by a suitable (proven) token curated registry.

The second point is to discourage participant FMs from
acting against the interests of pension holders in ways that
may occur in traditional pension schemes. In particular,
the onboarding system aims to actively discourage the
following behaviours:

e Off-mandate investments

e Fraud of various degrees

e Misleading or missing information regarding in-
vestment/asset status and/or management
To achieve these goals, a set of slashing conditions will
be employed, such that bad-actors of the system lose all
or portions of their stake when any or all of the above
behaviours are demonstrated. The exact set of conditions
to enforce these behaviours requires careful analysis and
simulation. Such studies will be published as the project
develops.
The size of the onboarding stake initially supplied by
FMs will be bound from below (i.e., a mandatory min-
imum stake size will be specified) and asymptotically
bound from above (i.e., a maximum stake), allowing the
staker to select a value in between. It is anticipated that
the size of the stake provided by an FM will act as a
quantitative measure of the FMs commitment to the prin-
ciples of transparent and accountable pension fund man-
agement advocated by Akropolis. In essence, the stake
demonstrates the extent to which the FM “backs them
self” to comply with the transparency requirements of the
platform. Akropolis has a built-in reputation-based sys-
tem (see Ranking and Reputation) which ranks /compares
funds on offer. As such, the amount of stake a fund man-
ager is willing to contribute will feed into the reputation
system, in a transparent way, and reflect the FM’s degree
of commitment to behaving reputably on the platform.

More formally,

Sp <S(w)<Sy:0<w<l,

with
S(0) = Sz, and S(1) = Su,

where S;, and Sy denote the lower and upper fixed stak-
ing bounds, respectively, S(w) denotes the stake a FM
wishes to contribute, and w € [0,1] serves as a quantita-
tive measure of the FM’s commitment to upholding the
values of the Akropolis platform. Further, the parameter
w can be fed into the ranking system. We expect S(w)
to be non-linear with respect to w, taking a form akin to
tanh(x), which should shift the FM distribution toward
a normal distribution.

2.5.2, ASSET REPORTING

As with traditional systems, fund managers will be
required to regularly report on the state of their asset
portfolio. The Akropolis platform will incorporate pro-
ocols to incentivise accountable reporting by FMs (see
he Incentivised Accountability section). FMs will be able
o stake tokens as part of the reporting process, with the
stake serving as a bounty for individuals/entities able to
demonstrate falsities within the report. Similar to the
onboarding stake, the amount staked by FMs during re-
porting may be optional but will serve to represent the
FMs confidence in, and commitment to, the validity of
heir report. This information will naturally feed into the
reputation and ranking system of the fund (see Ranking
and Reputation).

AKROPOLIS: A GLOBAL BLOCKCHAIN PENSIONS INFRASTRUCTURE 9

The staking mechanism is designed to encourage a new
class of (potentially anonymous) actors who can profit by
demonstrating the existence of inconsistencies in a fund
report. These actors must provide supporting evidence to
verify their claims, either in the form of documentation
hat demonstrates wrongdoing (i.e., whistle-blowers) or a
detailed analysis that demonstrates falsities in the report.
A more formal discussion of this mechanism is deferred
o the section titled Incentivised Accountability. The key
point is that tokens staked by a fund during reporting
will be partially dispersed to any actors able to prove
(more practically, convince a set of stakeholders) that the
report is misleading, inaccurate or invalid. Funds are
incentivised to participate in the staking process as good
ehaviour is rewarded by reputation points that can be
used for marketing and promotional purposes within the
latform (and, in principle, for external marketing).

2.5.3. RANKING AND REPUTATION

Any actor managing funds/assets on the Akropolis
platform must be extensively reviewed to comply with
both internal platform standards and all relevant laws and
regulations. In addition to ensuring platform users that
all FMs engaged with the platform are regulatory compli-
ant, Akropolis also provides a ranking system for FMs on
the system. Expected performance, actual performance
relative to expect performance and other measures allow
the construction of a single overall ranking for all funds on
the platform. Additionally, more-detailed rankings, that
incorporate factors such as reputation, ethical policies,
relative risk-profiles etc., will also be available, allowing
users to categorize funds based on a variety of metrics
(see the Ranking section for an in-depth discussion). Ul-
timately the ranking score will be representative of how
reliable (i.e. How often a fund meets it’s own targets
and how much it’s willing to stake to be reputable) and
trustworthy Funds are on the platform.

The overall rating given by Akropolis will likely feed
in a number of fundamental metrics, such as track record
of meeting expected returns, size of onboarding stake,
amount staked during reporting periods and relative per-
formance compared to other funds. Ultimately, it is en-
visaged that a high Akropolis rating could provide a type
of universal gold-standard for pension-based fund /asset
managers.

2.6. ASSET TOKENISATION

A blockchain-engaged pension protocol offers new ways
to provide transparent auditing trails for pension holders,
PFs and FMs. Excluding cryptocurrency assets, value-
stores held as part of a pension portfolio generally map to
real-world assets such as precious metals, fiat currencies,
properties, or businesses. Real-world assets need to be
tokenised in order to be represented within a blockchain

8Know Your Customer.
9 Anti money laundering.

rotocol. Thus, it will be necessary to tokenise various
sets to provide a digital record of user’s pension holdings.
Initially, it is envisioned that users will acquire AITs
after depositing funds into the system. These AITs can
be used to acquire tokens representing various pension
products provided by PFs. The initial phases will see a
small number of options available, aimed primarily at un-
sophisticated investors, with a greater range of products
being incorporated over time.
Token ownership entitles a user to the underlying assets
but also gives access to services, features and products
offered by PFs. For example, data feeds specifying as-
set performance, marketing material related to the given
asset class, or information regarding better-performing
assets, will be available to users (if they opt-in to receive
it). Thus, the token permits new ways of client engage-
ment, such as reward schemes and other benefits, all of
which can be accessed with a transparent, independently
verifiable audit trail.
Future implementations of the Akropolis platform will
include more options for sophisticated investors and indi-
vidualised pension products, including a larger and diverse
range of tokenised asset classes. Regulatory and practi-
cal requirements will require different degrees of central
oversight for the diverse range of asset cl. , though
Akropolis’ long-term vision is to decentralise as much of
the process as possible (see the Future Directions section
for more discussion).

2.7. BLOCKCHAIN WALLET, ASSET OWNERSHIP
AND IDENTITY

Decentralised identity, key management, and recovery
are very popular and active areas of research and devel-
opment in the blockchain community (an example of a
mature project in this space is uPort [27]). Akropolis
intends to eventually integrate with decentralised identity
platforms, such as UPort, however, due to the sensitive na-
ture of data that Akropolis will need to maintain, the ini-
tial implementation will operate a traditional centralised
database maintained by the Akropolis Foundation.

Identity and KYC® information, along with all personal
data, will be stored off-chain and maintained by the cen-
tralised Akropolis entity. User’s monetary transactions
and asset holdings will be stored on-chain. Each user will
possess their own blockchain wallet (and associated pri-
vate key(s)), which cryptographically verify ownership of
all assets in their holdings. Technically, a user’s wallet will
actually correspond to a collection of Ethereum addresses,
generated from a private seed, for new transactions on the
platform (see the Privacy section for further details). For
KYC and AML? purposes, each newly generated address
will be registered with the centralised Akropolis database.
Thus, Akropolis also maintains a database that maps
users to their public keys on the blockchain. We note

AKROPOLIS: A GLOBAL BLOCKCHAIN PENSIONS INFRASTRUCTURE 10

that this measure of pseudo-anonymity has many caveats
whose discussion is left for the Privacy section.

2.8. KEy/ASSET RECOVERY

No pension platform will be successful if it is possible
for a user to lose their life savings simply because they
forget /lose their authentication credentials. This topic
poses some slight contention with the use of decentralised
systems, which typically offer no recourse against lost
keys.

Akropolis will mitigate this issue. One possible res-
olution is to offer users the ability to split their wallet
secret (more technically, the seed that generates the series
of Ethereum private keys) into n pieces amongst friends
and family, such that & pieces are required to recover
the secret. Processes that facilitate this practice are well-
known; for example, Shamir’s secret sharing [28], and the
promising blockchain-focused project Tenzorum [29], offer
possible implementations.

Ultimately, and as a last resort, Akropolis can utilise
the centralisation aspects of asset tokenisers to re-assign
assets to new wallets for users who have unrecoverable
wallets. Such a re-issuance is in principle feasible, as the
Akropolis Foundation holds a central database of users’
asset holdings. In practice, Akropolis will not have the
control/ability to re-assign assets but, as a trusted entity,
Akropolis can submit requests to individual asset tokenis-
ers to re-assign the specific assets/holdings to ensure a
user’s account is entirely recoverable.

2.9. PLATFORM DEVELOPERS

The lifespan of the Akropolis platform will require
constant development as it transitions to its final decen-
tralised state. For this reason, the Akropolis platform
will retain a reserve fund of AKTs to incentivise com-
munity development. The contributing developers will
assist with extending services and features available on
the platform, through development on the underlying
blockchain layer, or, the application stack above. As such,
their contributions will be rewarded in AKTs from the
reserved development fund.

2.10. AKROPOLIS PLATFORM DATA

There are two major classifications of data that exist in
the Akropolis platform. Data that is public (i.e., put on
the public blockchain and visible to the world, known as
“on-chain” data) and data that is private (i-e., stored pri-
vately and securely by the central Akropolis Foundation,
known as “off-chain” data). A deeper classification and
discussion of these are given in the Data Model section
below.

When users join the Akropolis system, they may opt-in
to complete a financial profiling questionnaire, which will

10Se¢6 Privacy for further details discussing privacy concerns.

be undertaken entirely off-chain (private) and the data
will be stored by the Akropolis Foundation!®, Financial
rofiling data will be used to help users access funds and
pension products that best suit their risk-profiles and
financial goals.
Users’ monetary transactions and their portfolio, con-
sisting of the past and present totals of the funds/assets
hat a user has accumulated, are abstractly stored on the
public blockchain. Further details appear in the Privacy
section.
Akropolis gives users the ability to monetise this data.
Users can opt-in to add their profiling data and potentially
elements of their on-chain data (maintaining anonymity)
o be marketed and sold in bulk by the Akropolis founda-
ion to analysts and marketers. The resulting profits (in
AKT) will be distributed evenly to the participants who
chose to share their data. Ultimately, users are paid for
sharing their data.

2.11. REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

The pension industry is heavily regulated, as appropri-
ate for a core social and financial infrastructure intended
to maintain the living standards of a nation’s citizenry in
retirement. Though necessary to ensure a functioning pen-
sion sector, the dense regulatory environment surrounding
the pension industry provides one of many hurdles that
PFs and FMs must navigate to ensure compliance in rele-
vant jurisdictions. Akropolis aims to streamline regulatory
compliance by leveraging features of the platform.

Firstly, through the Onboarding/Vetting process,
Akropolis will verify and check compliance for all FMs
participating in the system, ensuring they comply with
all necessary standards, locally and globally (where ap-
propriate).
Secondly, it is often the case that the assets procured
by FMs will themselves be bound to specific geographic
regions and must therefore comply with regionally applica-
le rules and regulations. The asset tokenisation process
will allow specific regulatory and tax requirements to be
uilt into the token itself. This will allow seamless global
on-chain compliance at the blockchain layer. For exam-
ple, consider an investment in Australian property. An
individual property may be fractionalised into a set of
asset tokens. Australian law prohibits certain volumes of
property being sold to foreign investors. Given that par-
icipants in the Akropolis system have been KYC’d, it is
ossible to programmatically ensure (with a verifiable au-
dit trail) that the tokenised assets can only be transferred
‘o accounts within the platform that are either Australian-
owned or manifestly consistent with the demands of this
articular regulation. Similar automated compliance pro-
ocols will be applicable, and readily implemented, for a
wide range of assets.

Thirdly, the nature of pension investments often
requires time-locking of investment assets, to comply

AKROPOLIS: A GLOBAL BLOCKCHAIN PENSIONS INFRASTRUCTURE 11

with either regional regulatory policy or the specifi-
cations/requirements of the fund products themselves.
Compliance with time-locking requirements is another
area that can be easily automated using a decentralised
blockchain layer. Publicly verifiable locking of investments
for specific periods of time aids platform auditing and
ensures compliance with fund products and regulations.
To further this point, Akropolis will offer time-locked
contracts, where users can opt to lock their funds for
various periods of time, either for security, personal or
regulatory reasons. We envisage that three such wallets
will be regularly used; a retirement wallet (withdrawable
after a certain age, e.g., after turning sixty-five), an inter-
mittent release wallet (withdrawable at regular intervals)
and an emergency wallet (withdrawable after demonstrat-
ing an emergency, consistent with predefined standards).
These wallets are optional and can be designed to help
users manage their investments. As a general rule, how-
ever, in order to comply with regulatory requirements
regarding taxation and access to pension funds, time-
locking of (at least) some portion of a user’s funds is
anticipated. Implementing such time-locking is, of course,
a key advantage of blockchain-engaged systems such as
Akropolis, which permit automated secure time-locking
with full transparency.
The issue of regulatory compliance, for a pension plat-
form intending to facilitate the flexibility required of a
mobile global workforce, is a non-trivial matter. It is
important to emphasise that the above discussion does
not intend to over-simplify the complexities of regulatory
demands. Principally, there are two classes of regulatory
demands that must be integrated into such a system. One
set of requirements relates to the local or regional reg-
ulatory requirements that apply to a citizen of a given
state/jurisdiction. It is relatively easy to ensure that re-
gional compliance is afforded by the Akropolis platform.
KYC requirements ensure that users’ data is tied to a
particular jurisdiction and the platform can automati-
cally apply the relevant regulatory framework to a user’s
account.
A more complicated issue relates to the global or total
regulatory demands applicable for such a system. It is
trivial to reapply a new set of regulatory demands as an
individual updates their KYC information, thereby tran-
sitioning the governing framework for the user’s accoun
to the newly applicable jurisdiction (when appropriate).
However, ultimately it is desirable that a (minimal) se
of regulatory demands can be implemented on a globa!
scale, reducing the friction experienced by modern work-
ers engaging with the demands of an atomized, transient
work environment. The changing demands of the modern
workforce, and the forces they impart upon the individua
as they attempt to accrue an adequate pension, woul
ideally be matched by an evolving regulatory framework
that enables the global workforce to meet its needs. In
principle, a unified set regulatory demands could be ap-
plied to part or all of an individual’s pension accounts,
and an idyllic vision for the future regulatory environment

would see the regulatory framework evolve to increasingly
respond to the demands of the modern workplace. For
example, international trade agreements could include ef-
forts to provide common unifying regulatory frameworks
to steer global pension regulatory structures towards a
suitably homogeneous configuration. The Akropolis plat-
form is ideally suited to implement (and advocate for)
a global regulatory framework while incorporating rele-
vant jurisdictional-unique regulatory demands. The same
applies for the current tax landscape, whose framework
is heavily localised to specific geographical regions. In
fact, Akropolis intends to liaise with several regulatory
bodies of various countries to work towards recognizing
the Akropolis platform as a pension fund structure (for
individual contributors), allowing users to benefit from
pension-specific tax treatments, including the tax relief
on voluntary contributions.

It is emphasised that a perfectly homogeneous regula-
tory environment is unlikely in the near future, though
regulatory homogeneity across regions such as, e.g., the
Euro zone, offer some hope for such developments. The
Akropolis platform will, in practice, be a provider of ser-
vices that navigates a net of heterogeneous regulatory
rameworks. Nonetheless, the larger goal of Akropolis is
o design and advocate for a pension system that meets
he needs of workers, as both the workplace and leg-
islative agendas push greater responsibility for funding
retirement onto the individual. Decentralised implemen-
ations are perfectly suited for nudging pension regulatory
rameworks towards the modernisation necessitated by the
needs of global citizens. The capacity for technologically-
driven efficient protocols to advance outdated regulatory
rameworks is evidenced by advances in the sharing/gig
economy and the development of new monetary systems
such as Bitcoin itself. Services such as Uber and Airbnb
both forced regulatory environments across the globe to
adapt to the modern era. Service-driven technological
advances that better meet the needs of the population
can source the legislative change the population requires.
Thus, Akropolis is focused on developing a pension plat-
orm for the future, a system that learns from the failures
of the past, and leverages technological advances to meet
societal needs, while satisfying existing legislative require-
ments and advocating for legislative changes that ensure
hat users’ needs are met.

Akropolis will need to consider and implement futuris-
ic developments, such as the notion of a universal basic
income, or related means of allocating basic resources to
ensure that individuals can meet their needs in a work-
place heading towards mass-automation. Akropolis does
not advocate a particular position on such issues. How-
ever, Akropolis notes that the design of the Akropolis
platform, in which individuals possess a unique pension
account that is tied to their identity and acts as a portable
source of pension truth, as the individual navigates the
globe, is well suited to implement such futuristic pro-
grams.

AKROPOLIS: A GLOBAL BLOCKCHAIN PENSIONS INFRASTRUCTURE 12

2.12. PREMIUM SERVICES

The Akropolis platform is designed to help users tran-
sition from existing pension infrastructures to a more
flexible, transparent and accountable system. As such,
the platform adopts a freemium model, whereby users
can join and the base services are offered for free. In
addition to the base-level services, there will be extended
(premium) services available on the platform. The range
of extended services will inevitably expand as the plat-
form develops. To give the reader a sense of the expanded
services that may be offered, the following list contains
some examples:

e Ability to add beneficiaries (family members, part-
ners, friends, charities);

e Creation of Testament /Will Smart Contract (au-
tomatically assign holdings to a beneficiary in
case of death);

e Add a controller/manager (implement a program-
matic power of attorney, allowing users to appoint
a person or a group of people to manage invest-
ments).

e The platform will incorporate stress-testing fea-
tures for users, providing analysis of sector alloca-
tions and probable portfolio responses to extreme
market /sector movements. It is envisioned that
basic options will be available to all users (perhaps
for a small fee) while more advanced stress-testing
will be available as premium services.

e Cross-border assistance for expatriates, including
access to information regarding the pension sys-
tem in new host countries and tools for navigating
inter-jurisdictional transitions.

2.13. FEES

All fees referred to in this section will be paid for in AKT
tokens.

To combat the often complicated and hidden fee struc-
tures in traditional pension systems, Akropolis will imple-
ment a transparent and sustainable fee structure that both
encourages good behaviour and adequately remunerates
participants for their services.

There are four primary areas in which fees are taken
within the Akropolis platform.

Premium Service Fees — While Akropolis adopts a
freemium model for basic services, Premium Services are
offered at additional cost. These fees vary depending on
the service offered.

Onboarding Fees — FMs who wish to participate in
the Akropolis ecosystem will need to be on-boarded and
vetted in accordance with strict governance and regula-
tory guidelines (cf. Onboarding/Vetting). A flat fee is
charged in this process to cover the platform’s cost in
undertaking the vetting process. This fee also acts as

a deterrent to spamming and trolling attacks which can
plague Token Curated Lists.

Enterprise License Fees — In parallel to the public
Akropolis platform, an enterprise solution shall exist for
PFs to manage and track their investments across the
Akropolis platform (see the Enterprise Instances section).
This enterprise solution will allow FMs to interface with
specific PFs who wish to use a private or permissioned
blockchain implementation, mainly for data privacy rea-
sons. A license fee to use and access the platform will
be charged to FMs and PFs. These licence fees will help
support and grow the Akropolis platform, both in the
private and public domains.

Performance Fees — Performance fees are key in
he Akropolis model to ensure that FMs are incentivised
o provide the best possible investment services to the
Akropolis community. These fees will be based on trans-
arent templates (see Templated Transparent Fund Fees)
hat will be released to FMs according to the performance
of the assets under their management. This element can
e automated on-chain using smart contracts, whereby fee
withdrawals are permitted based on agreed values of the
effective returns compared to an FMs expected/promised
returns.

2.13.1. TEMPLATED TRANSPARENT FUND FEES

Given that contributions and returns are represented
on-chain in the form of AIT transactions, the fee struc-
ures implemented by PFs and FMs can be implemented
in smart contracts. Akropolis may issue a set of “stan-
dard” fee-templates as smart contracts. These contracts
can be easily implemented by a fee-charging entity with
heir own variables (e.g., percentage fees, etc.), providing
ransparency to assure users that there are no hidden fees.
These template fee contracts are reusable. Accordingly,
it is reasonable to expend the requisite effort to ensure
hat these templates are clearly explained and understood,
providing a significant improvement over the obfuscated

and unnecessarily complex fee structures often used in
he present environment.

In the event that a fee-charging entity wishes/needs to
implement their own fee-structure contract, the Akropolis
Foundation will be required to white-list the relevant con-
ract prior to acceptance onto the platform. During the
white-listing process, Akropolis may review the contract
and ensure that the fee structure is not unnecessarily
complicated and accurately reflects promises made to

users.

2.14. SUMMARY

The present section gave an overview of important
elements of the Akropolis platform. Some mechanisms
outlined above were intentionally communicated in a gen-
eral sense. Throughout the development of the Akropolis
AKROPOLIS: A GLOBAL BLOCKCHAIN PENSIONS INFRASTRUCTURE 13

platform, each aspect of the system will be carefully anal-
ysed and fine-tuned to ensure that the platform remains
commercially viable and technically feasible. Further
papers, detailing technical specifics for elements of the
system, will be forthcoming after sufficient real-world
testing is completed.

The remaining sections of this document provide more-
detailed discussion of key elements of the described sys-
tem. These sections aim to be relatively self-contained
and, where applicable, appropriately general.

3. INCENTIVISED ACCOUNTABILITY

The present section describes a general protocol for
incentivising good behaviour by participants in a market-
place comprised of service providers and service users [30].
This Incentivised Accountability Protocol (IAP) has im-
mediate application within the Akropolis platform but can
also be used in more-general marketplaces to incentivise
good behaviour by participants.

Participants who offer pension products on the Akropo-
is platform (either FMs of PFs, generically referred to
as FMs in this section) will be required to inform the
marketplace of the status and performance of their Funds
Under Management (FUM). Akropolis will require FMs
‘o deliver FUM status reports at regular specified periods
as a condition for continued access to the platform. In
order to (a) facilitate market transparency, (b) penalize
bad actors, and (c) reward good actors, Akropolis wil
incorporate incentivisation mechanisms designed to hol
FMs accountable for claims made in FUM reports.

The incentivisation process works as follows. Prior to
releasing a FUM report, FMs must lodge an amount o
AIT within the Akropolis system. These AITs are stake
as part of the accountability process. Once the stake is
received, the FM is authorized to release their report, a
hash of which is sent to the smart contract holding the
staked AIT. Upon receipt of the report hash, the smar
contract specifies that the stake is locked for a specified
period of Ts,4 days. During this period, the staked AIT
acts as a bounty that incentivises market participants to
provide evidence indicating that the FUM status repor
contains falsities. In principle, any interested individ-
ual/entity can analyse publicly available FUM reports
and attempt to access the bounty, though two classes of
market participants are clearly incentivised to verify the
tenacity of reports:

e Users invested in the product offered by the FM
are incentivised to verify the reported status of
assets held.

e Individuals with inside knowledge of false report-
ing may wish to inform the marketplace of the
FMs false claims (i.e., whistleblowers).

To make a claim of false reporting, an individual must
submit supporting evidence, a hash of which is submitted
to the smart contract storing the staked AITs. Submitted
evidence will be analysed and a judgement will be made

(see details below) regarding the tenacity of the FUM sta-
tus report. Two outcomes are possible at the conclusion
of the judgement period:

e The FMs status report is deemed valid. In this
case, the AIT staked by the FM is returned to
the FM after Ts,4 days have passed (i.e., the FM
avoids punishment for bad behaviour). Further-
more, the FM gains positive reputation points,
which can be used for marketing purposes within
the platform to promote the quality of products
offered by the FM (i.e., the FM receives rewards
for good behaviour).

e The FM status report is deemed invalid. In this
case, the staked AIT are forfeited and an amount
of reputation points are subtracted from the FM
(i.e., the FMs bad behaviour is punished).

Initial implementations of the IAP will require the out-
come of the assessment process to be inputted by the
owner of the staking contract. In the event of bad be-
haviour by an FM, the seized AIT are used to reward
he individual who submitted evidence demonstrating
he falsity of the report and to reimburse any authorities
engaged to assess the validity of the evidence. Specifi-
cally, the staked AIT are split between the address that
provided the hash of the evidence and an address that
stores AITs used to fund the assessment process.

A challenge to the validity of a FUM report begins
once the smart contract receives a hash of the evidence of
bad actions. When submitting a claim of falsity or mis-
leading conduct, the submitting entity (i.e., the claimant)
may also be required to lodge a small amount of AIT in

he staking contract. In the event that a ruling is made
in favour of the FM, the claimant forfeits the submitted
AITs, whereas the staked AIT is returned to the claimant
if a ruling is made in the claimant’s favour. Staking by
claimants may not be enforced in all scenarios employing
the IAP on the Akropolis platform, though one envisions
some scenarios where claimant staking will be necessary,
from a game theoretic perspective, to disincentivise bad
actions by claimants. In any case, it is anticipated that

claimant stakes will be relatively small, to allow genuine
claimants to submit their case without undue burden, yet
the claimant’s stake should also be sufficiently non-trivial
to discourage repetitive bad action on behalf of claimants.

Two phases are envisioned for the decision-making pro-
cess engaged to determine the tenacity of a claimant’s
evidence (i.e., the evidence assessment process). In the
initial implementation of the IAP, oversight will be pro-
vided by Akropolis, representatives of whom will act as
the owner of the staking contract. The contract owner

must:

e Undertake a preliminary assessment of the evi-
dence to ensure it is not clearly false.

e Initiate the evidence assessment process, in the
event that the evidence appears reasonable.
AKROPOLIS: A GLOBAL BLOCKCHAIN PENSIONS INFRASTRUCTURE 14

e Input the outcome of the assessment into the
smart contract, at the conclusion of the evidence
assessment process.

FIGURE 3. Sequence Diagram: A FM publishes a report
that is found to contain falsities.

This initial implementation clearly requires a central
authority. Ideally, a future phase of the IAP would re-
move the need for central oversight. The extent to which
the evidence assessment process can be decentralized de-
pends on the range of offences deemed punishable by the
Akropolis system. It is beyond the scope of the presen
document to analyse the legal complexities relevant for the
range of candidate bad actors, though it is evident tha’
in cases of overt criminal behaviour it may be necessary
to involve the relevant authorities. A sequence diagram
summarising the IAP, for the case of a published repor
that is found to contain falsities, appears in Figure 3.

Ideally, some components of the evidence assessmen
process could be decentralised by employing a staking
mechanism analogous to Augur [31]. The evidence assess-
ment process could use Augur itself or a purpose-buil
variant of such a system, constructed for internal users
of Akropolis. The decision-making process would work
roughly as follows. The staking smart contract receives a
hash of the FUM report and a hash of the evidence pur-
portedly demonstrating false reporting. These documents
are made publicly accessible, so that the relevant hashes
can be verified. Any individuals interested in analysing

the evidence and forming an opinion regarding the tenac-
ity of the report can stake some AIT and participate in
the decision-making process. All parties participating in
the evidence assessment process then vote as to the tenac-
ity of the report. The outcome of the vote is recorded by
the staking smart contract. All AITs staked by partici-
pants that voted against the majority are forfeited and
redistributed to participants within the majority. If the
majority votes in favour of bad action by the FM, the
AITs staked by the FM are included in the redistributed
AITs, modulo the percentage of the stake provided to
the address that supplied the hash of the evidence. This
provides a decentralized process for assessing the quality
of FM reports.

A couple of comments are in order. Firstly, there may
be instances in which the FUM report, and the evidence
of wrongdoing, are only made accessible to users hold-
ing assets with the given FM. In such cases, only those
users possessing tokens associated with the relevant in-
vestment product could stake AIT and participate in the
decision-making process (i.e., voting is only permitted
by those with a vested interest in the tenacity of the
report). Secondly, it is likely that the above decentralized
IAP would still require some degree of central oversight.
Given that assets and FUM are ultimately held exter-
nally in the physical world, there may be instances in
which legal authorities are required to take action against
FMs. The decentralized accountability incentivisation
mechanism would likely require central oversight to deter-
mine whether it is appropriate to conduct the evidence
assessment process in-house via Akropolis or whether the
matter needs to be forwarded to legal authorities. The
aspiration of Akropolis is to construct a system that is
maximally decentralized, while acknowledging the reality
that the pension sector imposes inherent constraints that
will require some degree of central oversight.

3.1. GENERAL COMMENT REGARDING THIS CLASS
OF INCENTIVISATION MODELS

The above discussion describes an IAP for accountable
reporting of product information by FMs. Ultimately this
general mechanism can be used in a variety of contexts
within the Akropolis platform and the above discussion,
which focused on the use case of FUM status reports, is
just one possibility. An alternative use case would relate
o product information and advertising material released
o Akropolis users by FMs. A similar incentivisation
structure would be possible - the FM submits an amount
of staked AIT to a smart contract, along with a hash of
he product information, advertising material or product
disclosure statements. Users could investigate the reliabil-
ity of claims made within the material, drawing attention
o unrealistic assumptions regarding anticipated returns
on FUM or any other information which may reasonably

e considered misleading. Akropolis users are incentivised
0 police the reliability of material posted by FMs, while
FMs are incentivised by the receipt of positive reputation

AKROPOLIS: A GLOBAL BLOCKCHAIN PENSIONS INFRASTRUCTURE 15

oints for marketing and informational material that has
been vetted by the staking process and deemed void of
misleading information.

Regarding the number of staked AITs required to im-
lement this mechanism, one possibility would be to allow
FMs to decide on the amount of AITs they’re willing
o stake when submitting material to the system. The
number of positive reputation points awarded to the FM
‘or good behaviour could be determined by the size of
he stake put forward by the FM to incentivise market
scrutiny - the stake size would represent the strength
of the FMs conviction regarding transparent and open
engagement with investors. Accordingly, an FM willing
to submit a larger stake should be rewarded with more
positive reputation points. Similarly, FMs that submit
a large stake that is ultimately forfeited due to bad be-
haviour may lose less reputation points than FMs that
forfeit a smaller stake, with the loss of the stake itself
considered an acceptable component of the punishment.

4. RANKING

Users of the Akropolis platform will benefit from rank-
ing metrics that can aid fund allocation decision-making
processes. Akropolis will provide multiple metrics for
assessing the performance of PFs and/or FMs. One im-
portant metric will be an overall ranking of raw fund
performance, i.e., a pure measure of fund returns, relative
to alternative funds on the market. Other measures will
assess the overall reputation of the fund provider, user
satisfaction, the clarity and transparency of marketing
material, and the FMs track record of meeting return
forecasts.

4.1. RELATIVE FUND RANKINGS

There are multiple ways to rank the relative perfor-
mance of funds. One approach would be to employ a
generalized implementation of the Elo rating system [32].
Elo developed a rating system for two-player games that
can be applied to, e.g., chess or video games. Participants
begin with a specified amount of ranking points and gain
(lose) points, at the expense (benefit) of their opponent,
whenever they win (lose) a game. Over time, players
receive a ranking that encodes their relative number of
victories and losses (or draws), while also factoring in the
relative-ranking of opponents they have beaten/lost to.
The relative ranking of two players also encodes the prob-
ability that each would be expected to emerge victorious
if they competed.

For present purposes, it may be necessary to generalize
the Elo rating system to games with n players (in the
present case, players are individual funds). Denoting the
rankings of the players in a two-player game as R;, with
i € {1,2}, the two-player Elo rating system proceeds by

defining an estimated score for the players, defined as

: (a)

where i,j € {1,2} with i 4 j. Note that the estimated
scores sum to unity, an E; = 1. The constant D is
chosen such that an advantage of D rating points over an
opponent translates into the player’s expected score being
magnified by ten times, relative to the opponents expected
score. At the games conclusion, the players actual score is
determined by a scoring function. For example, a suitable
scoring function for chess is

a

0 if player i loses
Sy = 1/2 if player i draws (2)
1 if player 7 wins,

and the players ranking is updated as:
Rio = R4+ K(S;- £;.) (3)

Here K is a numerical factor that can be used to encode
the relative impact of the outcome of the new game, on
the player’s ranking; i.e., a “master,” with a large number
of prior victories, may have a smaller value of K, such
that the impact of a single loss is not severe, while a
“beginner” may have a larger value of K, so that a single
loss has a considerable impact on their ranking.

The Elo rating system can be generalized to an n-player
game by treating the n-player game as a set of games
in which every player is competing against every other
player. Thus, the single n-player game can be treated
as n(n — 1)/2 two-player games. The players estimated
scores can be cast as

1 1
E; x (4
‘ n(n — 1)/2 X 1+ 10(Ri—R;)/D [’ (4)
j#i

where once again the estimated scores sum to unity,
Soi, Ei = 1. The scoring function for the n-player game,
for which the n participants are ranked from first to last,
can be written as

Sin = agate (5)

where player i, who finishes in place p, receives the score
Sip. Player rankings are again calculated as:

Ri = R4+K(Sip — Ej). (6)

This generalized Elo rating system provides an exam-
ple for a method to rank fund performance on Akropolis.
Fund performance would be ranked at some regular in-
terval, producing a relative ranking for all funds that
evolves with time. The constant Kk could start out being
equal for all funds, in the first phase of the Akropolis
platform, and subsequently evolve to ensure that a fund
with a strong history of reliable performance is not unduly
penalized for a single bad year, while the volatility of the
ranking for a new fund is more sensitive to the fund’s
yearly performance in its initial years.
AKROPOLIS: A GLOBAL BLOCKCHAIN PENSIONS INFRASTRUCTURE 16

4.2. REPUTATION RANKINGS

The Akropolis platform will provide additional classes
of ranking measures for the benefit of users. The plat-
form includes incentives to encourage accountability and
ransparency of FMs and part of these mechanisms in-
cludes the reward (or removal) of reputation points for
good/bad actions. For example, funds that deliver their
romised returns can receive reputation points, and simi-
arly funds that stake AITs to incentivize scrutiny of their
reports will be rewarded with reputation points in the
event that their reports survive the scrutiny. It will also
e possible to acquire reputation for delivering transpar-
ent and informative marketing and/or product material
o the marketplace. Other sources of reputation mea-
sures may also be possible. These alternative measures of

‘und performance will be available for users to aid their
decision-making and will also serve as marketing tools for
funds on the platform.

The factor K that feeds into the overall fund rank-
ing could also be given a sensitivity to the reputation

measures derived by the platform, such as measures of
user satisfaction and fund transparency and accountabil-
ity. For example, if a fund has r, reputation points, and
one takes K x rhs funds with a stronger reputation
will be less sensitive to a poor performance than a fund
with a poorer reputation. More generally, including the
factor w that quantifies the FMs commitment to the prin-
ciples of transparent and accountable reporting (see The
Akropolis Platform), the K factor may take the form
K= K(w,rp',--); where the dots denote additional
relevant dependencies.

The platform will provide overall rankings both with
and without the reputation sensitivity, allowing users
purely interested in returns to select funds based solely
on that measure, while users applying other fund allo-

cation strategies may utilise rankings that incorporate
various reputation factors. It would also be possible to
include reputation systems that rank funds according to
ethical factors such as environmental impact, employee
conditions, gender equality in leadership, etc., allowing
users to apply various ethically-oriented fund allocation
strategies.

5. GOVERNANCE

Akropolis’ long-term objective is to maximise the de-
gree of decentralised functionality available on the plat-
form.'! Within the maximally decentralised vision for the
platform, the centralised oversight initially provided by
the Akropolis Foundation will be largely replaced by a
Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO). In prac-
tice, the degree of decentralisation ultimately achieved
will be subject to legal/regulatory requirements and the
functional benefits for the platform. Furthermore, even
after the Akropolis platform transitions to a system with a

11See the Future Directions section for further discussion.

DAO governing body, it is envisioned that a small, elected
body of curators will still be required to oversee the plat-
form and rule on specific crowd-proposed issues. This
body, hereafter referred to as the Akropolis Council, will
coexist with the governing DAO and assist with various
operational functionality.

The detailed implementation of any DAO requires care-
ful consideration of a number of issues. In particular, it
is crucial that the decision-making process avails a le-
gitimate and provably-fair framework for organisational
governance. The present section explores existing re-
search on DAO governance models and considers possible
DAO implementations that may be compatible with fu-
ture versions of the Akropolis platform. It is emphasised
that the implementation of decentralised oversight within
Akropolis is a long-term vision. Initial implementations
of Akropolis will include central oversight by the Akropo-
lis Foundation and no move to decentralisation will be

made without detailed consideration, rigorous testing, and
careful implementation. The motivation for decentralised
oversight stems primarily from the view that individuals
should be empowered to control their financial future,
not only in terms of building a pension fund, but also
by determining the rules governing the functionality of
the systems that control and implement their pension
decisions. As the platform evolves, the extent to which
decentralisation is appropriate and desired by platform
users will be assessed and serve as the basis for future
platform planning; i.e., decentralisation will not be im-
posed but will instead be utilised if it serves the needs of
platform users.

5.1. IMMEDIATE CHALLENGES

The immediate challenges that must be overcome for
a DAO implementation to be successful include the fol-
lowing:

Governance scalability — It can be extremely dif-
ficult to mobilise a community to achieve a quorum for
voting on organisational resolutions. The difficulty of
attaining this goal typically increases with the number of
participants in the system. This issue is well known and
was encountered in many votes that occurred within The

DAO [33].

Governance resilience — Naive DAO implementa-
tions often employ a majority vote, requiring more than
50% of participants to vote in unison to pass a resolution.
Such systems can be vulnerable to 51% attacks - failure
to carefully design optimal DAO implementations can
allow malicious external actors to acquire 51% of votes
AKROPOLIS: A GLOBAL BLOCKCHAIN PENSIONS INFRASTRUCTURE 17

and implement various attacks, such as stealing staked
deposits.

Game-theoretic equilibrium — DAO implementa-
ions that permit a wide range of voting proposals can
e susceptible to attacks in which proposals that benefit
he majority of participants are put forward and rapidly
endorsed. Such proposals introduce bias into the voting
system and can produce undesired outcomes. A triv-
ial example would be a proposal that splits profits with
articipants who vote yes.

Governance extensibility — Fully decentralised sys-
ems can often be a double-edge sword. They provide a
rustless deterministic framework but issues can arise if
he framework itself is flawed. Mechanisms should be im-
lemented, within the governance framework itself, that
permit the governance framework to be extensible and
upgradeable.

Dormant Tokens — Systems that do not offer key-
recovery are susceptible to tokens/assets/votes gradually
eing lost and/or removed from circulation. If a system’s
okens are used for voting, the assumption that all tokens
are capable voting becomes less accurate over time. This
is known as the dormant token problem [34]. A success-
‘ul DAO should account for dormant tokens and adjust
internal variables accordingly.

5.2. APPROACH

Several authors have investigated governance issues for
decentralised systems and organisations [35, 36, 37]. In
the present context, the modular design proposed and
built by DAOStack [38] is of particular relevance. This
design, coined the Operating System for DAQs, allows
for replacement /modification of individual components
that constitute the overall governance framework. It ad-
dresses many of the immediate challenges listed above
and provides an extensible framework on which to build
a governing protocol.

In the design of an over-arching governing protocol,
Akropolis will also include the following extended princi-
ples:

e Monetisation of attention:

— Incentivising voters to participate in impor-
tant votes by compensating voters for their
time. This could be achieved, for example,
by remunerating voters using tokens from
the community-pool.

— Attention can also be monetized via a
reputation-based system: the more often a
member votes on proposals, the more repu-
tation points they receive.

e Delegation:

— Passive/dormant token holders will have the
ability to delegate their vote to other mem-
bers of the network or to the Akropolis

Council. This allows idle participants to
contribute their voting power with minimal
effort.

e Token-holder individual sovereignty:

— In the event that a token holder’s opinion
contradicts the vote submitted by his/her del-
egate, Akropolis will allow for vote overrid-
ing, enabling token holders to express their
opinion at all times. This significantly miti-
gates the risk of coercion and collusion and
aids the prevention of cartels.

Monetary incentives are not the only way to encour-
age good behaviour and/or discourage bad behaviour in
DAO structures. The Akropolis reputation system (see
Ranking and Reputation) can be integrated into many of
the modular components that constitute the governance
protocol. Thus, reputation-based incentives can also be
used to encourage the above behaviours. We explore this
possibility in more detail in the following section.

5.3. AKROPOLIS REPUTATION SYSTEM

Reputation-based incentivised governance models have
been explored by the community (see Ref. [38] for an
example). The present section considers the potential
for incorporating the Akropolis reputation system into
a decentralised governance model. A governance sys-
tem that utilises governing members’ (or participants’)
reputation must ensure that reputation points (which
abstractly represent an increase in reputation) are non-
transferable. Furthermore, the system protocol must
clearly elucidate the ways in which reputation points are
distributed amongst users. Below, a set of general guiding
rules for awarding reputation points, within the context
of decentralised governance models, are proposed. These
may serve as the basis for the development of a more
fully-fledged reputation-based governance system.

(1) Community-assigned reputation points: A pro-
cess whereby community members may submit
proposals for a given platform participant to be
awarded reputation points. The recommendation
is only enacted after the proposal is voted on.

(2) Algorithmic reputation flow: A set of rules which
dictates a system for dynamic reputation-point
assignment, including but not limited to:

(a) Automatically assigning reputation points
for the submission of approved proposals.

(b) Automatically assigning reputation points
for early votes in accordance with the major-
ity.

(3) Platform usage: Reputation points can be
awarded to users that actively/regularly partici-
pate in the system, either as users or developers.
Various metrics can be used to quantify a user’s
level of participation, ranging from the amount
of pension assets stored within the platform, the
AKROPOLIS: A GLOBAL BLOCKCHAIN PENSIONS INFRASTRUCTURE 18

number of votes participated in, or the frequency
of platform activity.

Similarly, a set of rules can be enforced to decrease the
reputation of specific participants. The rule-set could be
based on events such as:

(1) Submission of a rejected proposal.

(2) Inactivity (Dormant-tokens): Token holders who
do not delegate their voting power and do not
participate in the last x proposals.

It seems fitting to decrease a user’s reputation to disin-
centivise the occurrence of these (and related) events.

5.4. AKROPOLIS COUNCIL

Decentralised systems often require a core group of par-
ticipants who are responsible for casting final rulings on
decisions initiated by the wider community of participants.
Such agents, referred to as curators, are often elected from
the participating community and given specific privileges
on the system. In the present context, the curators of the
decentralised Akropolis platform are referred to as the
Akropolis Council.

It is anticipated that the initial body of curators wil
be chosen from the founding Akropolis team and leading
experts in the industry. This includes reputable figures
with relevant experience, such as pension advisors an
consultants, asset /fund onboarding specialists, investment
managers with specific sector expertise, financial planners
and regulators.

The council of experts will be elected and maintaine
by the governing DAO. In the event of curator inactivity,
the DAO may propose the removal of a member and elec
a replacement. At any point, proposals may be made to
replace council members to mitigate centralisation an
prevent council member misbehaviour.

The responsibilities of the Akropolis council will in-
clude the maintenance of the FM registry, which functions
as a token curated registry (see the following subsection).
Council members will act as the curators of the registry.

5.5. TOKEN CURATED REGISTRIES

Token curated registries have recently received much
attention in the decentralised community. In particu-
ar, a number of authors have explored the concept of
DAO-maintained token curated registries [39, 40, 41].

Functionality of the Akropolis platform necessitates
hat a list of vetted Fund Managers, who are authorised
© interact with contributors (individual contributors and
pension funds), is maintained. Within the initial imple-
mentation of the Akropolis platform, the list of vetted
latform participants will be maintained by the Akropolis
Foundation. However, as the platform transitions to a
more decentralised framework, it is anticipated that this
centralised aspect of the system will be converted to a
DAO-maintained token curated registry.

12 random bit of information that makes the hash unique.

The purpose of a token curated registry is to provide
a decentralised, self-sustaining registry of elements tha’
conform to some externally agreed-upon metric. Any en-
tity interested in adding an element to the list is required
to stake some monetary value as assurance that the el-
ement confirms to the agreed upon metric. The wider
community may challenge the purported suitability of an
element and, if it is decided that the element does no
conform to the metric, obtain the elements stake.

This logic can be applied directly to realise a decen-
tralised tool for constructing and maintaining a list o
FMs on the Akropolis platform. In the event that the
governing DAO issues challenges to FMs that (suppos-
edly) don’t conform to some requirement, the Akropolis
council could be tasked with performing the necessary
background checks to ensure that the requisite standards
are being met. At any given time, challenges against
listed FMs could be issued by token holders or external
pseudonymous/anonymous actors (see for example, the
Fisherman-like protocol [20]). The Akropolis Council will
likely be responsible for reviewing these challenges and de-
ciding (through voting) if it is appropriate for the selected
FM to remain on the token curated registry.

As a final comment, it is noted that the well-known
issue of passive token-holding, which leads to easier ex-
ploitations of 51% attacks (majority validator attacks)
can be mitigated in the event that Akropolis includes a
voting-delegation mechanism. Such a scenario would, in
principle, incentivise token-holders to either participate
in the curation of the registry or delegate their vote.

5.6. VOTING MECHANISM

Voting mechanisms must be carefully developed and
deployed in order to ensure that voting processes do not
admit biases that can influence the outcome of votes.
If, for example, participants’ votes are public, the in-
formation can bias future votes cast by participants yet
to submit their vote. Here, a potential implementation
is outlined which provides vote secrecy at the cost of
greater user participation. It is based on the well-known
partial-lock commit-reveal commitment scheme [42, 43].

The basic strategy is outlined in the following steps

(1) Proposal submission: A token holder may sub-
mit a proposal to be voted on by the community.
Votes are either in favour or against.

(2) Votes submission:

(a) Commit stage: users who wish to vote on
the proposal submit a hash of their vote and
a salt.!?

(b) Reveal stage: users reveal their votes by sub-
mitting their choice (either yes or no) along
with the salt used.

(3) Proposal outcome: Once the reveal period has
ended, the result is automatically recorded by the
voting smart contract.

5.7. FINAL COMMENTS

The above discussion provides an overview of candidate
issues and solutions that are relevant for a decentralised
implementation of the Akropolis platform. The purpose
of the discussion is to provide a general sense of rele-
vant considerations involved in the development of such
a platform. As already mentioned, the move towards a
decentralised framework (or even features) will be care-
‘ully considered and only implemented if it adds value
and quality of services for platform users. The preferred
goal of Akropolis is to embrace the community-oriented
erspectives inherent in the decentralised developmental
community and focus these perspectives to deliver optimal
roducts that protect individuals from regulatory
uncertainty and centralised points of weakness, while em-
owering individuals to secure their own financial future.
To the extent that decentralisation serves the broader
goals of the Akropolis platform, Akropolis will investigate
and embrace promising decentralised implementations.
However, decentralisation will not be pursued purely for
its own sake - ultimately the governance and functioning
of the Akropolis platform must serve the interests of pen-
sion holders, and developmental choices will reflect this
riority.

6. DATA MODEL

A guiding principle of the Akropolis project is to pro-
vide transparency and accountability through the use of
distributed ledgers. However, it is important that this
objective is attained whilst simultaneously ensuring tha
latform users maintain sovereignty over their private an
ersonal information. Akropolis will be required to handle
sensitive information (e.g., during onboarding and vet-
ing) and maintain records of (some of) this information.
Storing such information in the present regulatory contex
necessarily involves a private, permissioned database.
To achieve the competing goals of transparency and
privacy, it is helpful to envision splitting the Akropolis
data model into two broad categories, namely private
and public data. Information on the public database is
assumed to be public to the Internet and as such mus:
 non-sensitive or sufficiently encrypted. The private
database is expected to be fully-encrypted and only acces-
sible by Akropolis. Accordingly, it may contain personally
identifiable and sensitive information.

This section outlines the requirements of the public
and private databases and the entities involved in their
main processes. The overall role of the private database
is also briefly discussed.

6.1. PUBLIC DATABASE

The public database is assumed to involve a blockchain,
such as Ethereum [9]. Implementation considerations will
determine whether the public database is truly public to
the Internet, or resides within a permissioned network

(such as a corporate network). The Akropolis protocol is
intended to be blockchain agnostic, however, for initial
implementation considerations, Akropolis functionality
will be designed to be compatible with the capacities of
the current public Ethereum “mainnet”.. References to
“smart contracts” and related Ethereum-specific terms can
be readily generalised and applied to other blockchains.
It is not necessary to assume that the public database
consists of a single database — pre-existing bridging solu-
tions between multiple Ethereum chains [44] would allow
a public database to span multiple Ethereum instances,
allowing the inclusion of low-fee and highly scalable proof-
ofauthority (PoA) chains. Furthermore, inter-protocol
solutions [20, 21, 22] utilising an intermediary chain are
showing progress and could allow for inclusion of multiple,
disparate chains.

6.1.1. REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS

Selecting a public database (i.e., blockchain) is a
complex choice, involving more than a simple technical-
requirements analysis, as used for a relatively static tech-
nology such as a web server, and being more akin to se-

lecting a long-term strategic business partner. Aspects of
the economic and political factors involved in this decision
(such as the viability of available consensus mechanisms
and governance profiles) are discussed elsewhere. The
present section focuses on technological requirements of

the public database to determine the base level of required
functionality.

The public blockchain must provide data storage and
processing for the following features:

e Account-keeping — maintaining a tamper-
proof ledger of value transfer around the Akropo-
lis system, with the specific goal of providing a
public view of fund performance.

e Gate-keeping — providing mechanisms to pro-
tect users and institutions from malicious activity
by non-vetted entities.

e Staking and voting — allowing users to par-
ticipate in decision-making and crowd-sourced
processes by providing tamper-proof voting and
arbitrarily complex escrow functionality.

Given these requirements, any blockchain used as the
public database should possess the following qualities:

e Turing-complete smart contracts — future
functionality should not be bounded by the lack
of general computing capacities.

e Unbounded storage — the public database
should not impose artificial storage limits that
could impede the future development of the plat-
form.

e Open-source cryptography — all cryptogra-
phy should be open source and community tested.

e Existing tool-sets — the chain should have an
actively maintained ecosystem of third-party and
vendor-issued tool-sets. Examples include: block
explorers, open-source development tools (testing

AKROPOLIS: A GLOBAL BLOCKCHAIN PENSIONS INFRASTRUCTURE

and deployment suites,
etc.) and analysis tools.

tatic analysis, UI tooling,

The following sections provide additional details re-
garding the above-mentioned process.

6.1.2. ACCOUNT-KEEPING

In its simplest form, the public database can be viewed
as an account-keeping mechanism that tracks the allo-
cation of funds in the Akropolis platform. As seen in
Figure 4, this (somewhat simplified) overview involves
the following objects:

e Account — a native account object on the un-
derlying blockchain (e.g., an externally-owned
account on Ethereum). It is expected that a user
will control multiple accounts.

e Wallet — a smart contract providing functional-
ity necessary to delegate funds to FMs/PMs and
manage tokenised assets.

e Delegate — an object that manages funds del-
egated from a user wallet (PMs and FMs would
fall into this category).

e Asset — a tokenised asset.

in future iterations.

tains the source-of-truth for AIT balances. This

for each token transfer.

6.2. PRIVATE DATABASE

The initial requirements of a centralised Akropolis
Foundation do not mandate that the private database
involves a blockchain; in the current technological land-
scape it may be more efficient to implement a “traditional”
database (e.g., PostgreSQL [45]).

The private database must store the following:

(1) Links between pseudonymous account addresses
and personally-identifiable information.

(2) Personally-identifiable information collected dur-
ing the use of Akropolis services.

(3) Identity documents collected during onboarding
process.

(4) Sensitive corporate information.

It is not anticipated that the structure of the private
database will be novel. Accordingly, it is not necessary
to present additional information here.

6.3. SUMMARY

The Akropolis platform will employ both traditional
and blockchain data bases to achieve the combination of
privacy and transparency required of a portable, reliable
pension service provider. The ratio between public and
private computing and storage structures will vary ac-
cording to the functional requirements of a given service
and the extent to which decentralised governance and ac-
countability protocols can be implemented. Functionality
offered by the Ethereum blockchain provides the initial
template for what is achievable with public blockchain

databases, though these capabilities will no doubt evolve
as the underlying blockchain technologies advance.

7. ENTERPRISE INSTANCES

The present paper has presented the Akropolis system
as a singular, public-facing platform. However, an en-
erprise version of the platform, which can be deployed
on various private, permissioned blockchains, will also
be released. The purpose of such a system is to provide
arge PFs with the option to incorporate the improve-
ments offered by the Akropolis platform into their own
private and protected corporate networks. Existing pen-
sion industry infrastructure and processes are likely to
impose realistic constraints on the capacity of industry
articipants to transition to new systems. The Akropolis
enterprise solution aims to provide a bridge that allows
existing industry participants to engage with the Akropo-
is platform, and benefit from new service features, whilst
retaining familiar levels of control over internal infrastruc-
ure and processes. The enterprise solution will reduce
riction between PFs and FMs by allowing both parties
o benefit from the vetting practices, reputation systems
and incentive structures that Akropolis provides, whilst
ensuring no commercially-sensitive information leaves the
organisation.

Instances of the Akropolis enterprise solution will pro-
vide direct functionality between FMs, PFs and asset
tokenisers. Private instances will also connect to the
Akropolis core system (with read-only functionality) to
utilise the reputation and vetting registrars of the core
system. AKTs and AITs may be present in any given
enterprise system but their use is not mandatory and
their functionality may be altered:

e AIT — the fiat-to-AIT (and vice-versa) conver-
sion provided by Akropolis will not be required for
investments between PFs and FMs in enterprise
instances. Instead, the managing entity of the
instance would ensure the ledger is updated with
regards to capital flows between organisational
units within, and external to, the given entities.
Thus, Akropolis will not be required to act as a
“middleman” for each transaction on enterprise
networks.

e AKT — functionality will match that of the
public instance (e.g., used for staking and fee pay-
ment, if required). AKT can be “forwarded” to
an enterprise instance using a bridging mecha-
nism [44].

Assets in an enterprise environment may be issued
internally, or they may be transferred from the global
public Akropolis system (akin to AKT) to allow asset
trading inside the enterprise environment. Thus, it will be
possible to directly trade asset tokens (such as gold [46]
or fiat currencies [47]) within the enterprise environment.

The user interface supplied for enterprise instances
would be tailored to suit the needs of enterprise clients.

AKROPOLIS: A GLOBAL BLOCKCHAIN PENSIONS INFRASTRUCTURE 22

Features such as reporting, performance analysis, and in-
egration to existing corporate authentication structures,
will be included.
The underlying blockchain for enterprise instances of
Akropolis will initially derive their design/functionality
eatures from the Ethereum blockchain, to ensure com-
patibility with the initial implementation of the public
Akropolis platform. Due to the private nature of the enter-
rise solution, the corresponding chains will likely require
a permissioned node discovery protocol and an altered
consensus mechanism to that of the standard Ethereum
ETHash Proof of Work algorithm. Quorum [48] is a
ikely candidate. Such chains will enable processing of the
Ethereum smart contracts already developed for the core
ublic Akropolis platform, whilst facilitating the private
and permissioned needs of a corporate pension fund.

Enterprise instances will allow Akropolis to engage
with existing pension industry participants whilst gener-
ating revenue streams to facilitate future developmental
ambitions. With regard to Akropolis’ long-term objec-
tives, the enterprise instances will provide a bridge that
allows Akropolis to navigate existing constraints, imposed
by legacy pension systems and processes, whilst building
partnerships to aid the realisation of Akropolis’ larger
goals.

8. PRIVACY

Any public blockchain-enabled system must deal with
the serious issue of privacy on a public ledger. The Akropo-
lis platform boasts transparency and accountability for
interactions between users, PMs, FMs, and tokenised as-
sets. However, the platform must also satisfy stringent
requirements for user privacy. It is imperative that the
dichotomy between transparency and privacy is managed
effectively within this system.

The present section outlines the privacy model of the
system, describes eminently-feasible methods of imple-
menting such a model in the current technological land-
scape (along with limitations), and discusses ways in
which emerging technologies may provide more interest-
ing/robust solutions in the long-term.

8.1. USER PRIVACY

Information generated while using the Akropolis plat-
form can be categorized into three broad categories:

e Confidential — information that should never
be publicly released, such as passports, identifi-
cation documents, passwords, and commercially-
sensitive information.

e Personal — personally-identifiable information
which may only be released to a third-party with
the permission of the user/organisation. For ex-
ample, account balances, personally-identifiable
transactions and contact information.

e Public — information that should be publicly
available; e.g., non-personally-identifiable trans-
actions and public announcements.

Confidential information should never be released and
must therefore be stored in a private database exclusively
accessible by the Akropolis Foundation (as discussed in
the Private Database section). Public information is nat-
urally public, however, specific privacy limitations still
apply (see the GDPR section for GDPR considerations).
Personal information is private by default but can be
revealed to a subset of individuals/entities at will. This is
addressed by a simplistic pseudonymous scheme described
in the following section.

8.1.1. PSEUDONYMOUS TRANSACTIONS

To allow personal information to be private-until-
disclosed, Akropolis intends to implement a pseudony-
mous account/address scheme. In this scheme, all trans-
actions exist on the public Ethereum ledger, yet the link
between Ethereum account(s) and the individual who
owns them (the user’s wallet) is known only to the private
Akropolis Foundation, the user and whomever they wish
to disclose this link to. The initial scheme works simply
by linking a wallet to a private seed which is used to
generate new Ethereum private keys in each transaction.
The wallet therefore consists of an arbitrary number of
underlying Ethereum addresses.

Schemes in which user wallets are comprised of multiple
underlying addresses exist naturally in unspent transac-
ion output (UTXO) ledgers such as Bitcoin [8]. Often
wallets in UTXO blockchains intentionally create new ad-
dresses with each transaction to aide anonymity through
obscurity of addresses in underlying blockchain layer. This
echnique is not without issues. Data analysis strategies
such as address clustering [49, 50] can be used to group
addresses back to singular identities in some cases. This
particular strategy is only applicable to UTXO-based
ledgers. However, it is anticipated that other forms of
analysis (such as timing analysis) may be performed to
partially reconstruct user’s wallets from the underlying
Ethereum accounts.

Due to the trust which must be placed upon the
Akropolis Foundation to meet regulatory requirements
(e.g., KYC and vetting), the platform is afforded some ex-
tra functionality that can avoid such analysis techniques
and would otherwise be difficult to obtain in a fully trust-
less environment like Bitcoin. Specifically:

Private entry and exit from AIT — issuance and
redemption of AIT is handled by Akropolis, who maintain
a private mapping of accounts to user identities. This
means that no third-party exchanges are involved, localis-
ing the trust requirements to Akropolis.

Obscured inter-account transactions — consider
the case where a user, U, has revealed their primary ac-
count address, a¥, to a third party, T. If U decides they
do not wish to disclose further transactions to T, U could
transfer their funds into an another account aJ’. Unfor-
tunately, this transfer would be visible to T who could

AKROPOLIS: A GLOBAL BLOCKCHAIN PENSIONS INFRASTRUCTURE 23

then link a¥ to U. To remove this public link between
the two accounts, Akropolis can offer a “private transfer”
from one wallet to another, obfuscating not only the “to”
address, but also the time and amount of transfer. This
would allow U to transfer the funds via Akropolis, leaving
no trace for T and trusting no other party than Akropo-
lis. This is not dissimilar to a standard cryptocurrency
tumbler.

8.1.2. GDPR

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
act [51] becomes active in May 2018 and Akropolis will
undoubtedly need to adhere to its requirements. As such,
Akropolis is designed GDPR-native, avoiding the costs of
dedicating resources and budget towards migrating legacy
systems [52].

Akropolis satisfies GDPR Article 25 [51], “data protec-
tion by design and default”, by ensuring that the highest
level of privacy is enabled out-of-the-box and that encryp-
tion and decryption are handled locally (following the
European Union Agency for Network and Information Se-
curity’s specification [53]). On-chain data is minimised to
reduce user risk and overhead. Also mentioned in Article
25 and Recital 28 [51], on-chain data is made pseudony-
mous to reduce risks to and protect the rights of users.
Data portability (Article 20 [51]) is enabled through the
use of blockchain — transactions on-chain are open to
he public and may be translated and ported to another
system without any action required of Akropolis.

A significant point of contention around GDPR require-
ments is Article 17 [51], the “right to erasure” (“right to be
forgotten”). The contention arises in that the erasure of a
single record from a blockchain ledger will necessarily de-
stroy the integrity of the ledger — data can be “removed”
rom the current Ethereum state trie, however, a record
of its presence remains preserved within the blockchain’s
history. Furthermore, irrespective of the integrity of the
ledger, once data has been published to a public network
(such as the Ethereum network), seeking a guarantee of
erasure from an anonymous, decentralised network of com-
puters is infeasible, if not impossible. Other projects in
he blockchain space are working actively on this prob-
em [54, 55] and Akropolis will continue to adapt and
iterate as the GDPR implications for blockchain become
apparent. Regardless, Akropolis does not publish per-
sonal information to the blockchain — all transactions
ublished are done so directly by the user, at their
ion.

iscre-

8.2. CREDENTIAL MANAGEMENT

Given that there are two separate data storage and
processing mechanisms used in Akropolis (see the Data
Model section), there are two distinct scenarios in which
a user may manage their credentials:

e Off-chain information — information stored by
Akropolis will be centrally managed, therefore tra-
ditional credential management solutions apply,
such as password authentication with multiple
factors (2FA) and password recovery through a
proof-of-identity submission to Akropolis.

e On-chain information — ownership of an ac-
count on a blockchain is generally !3 indicated by
the possession of the private key corresponding to
that address. Therefore maintaining knowledge of
that private key is critical to maintaining access
to that account. The following section details this
further.

8.2.1. CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEY MANAGEMENT

To reduce the burden on users of managing multiple
private keys, Akropolis envisages the use of a system that
derives keys from a seed recoverable from a mnemonic
phrase [57]. Such phrases are commonly used in hard-
ware [58, 59] and software [60, 61] wallets. Using such a
system allows a user to, in effect, derive a limitless number
of keys from a single phrase, without the risk that an
opponent can feasibly imply a link between any of the
addresses.

A reasonable scenario exists in which a user completely
loses access to their private keys, therefore losing the
ability to transact their AIT and make other on-chain
transactions. Such a scenario would be dire, especially if
it resulted in the loss of a users entire pension savings.
Fortunately, there are methods to mitigate the conse-
quences of a user losing their private keys, as discussed
in the Key/Asset Recovery section.

8.3. FUTURE PRIVACY SOLUTIONS

The design proposed to obscure identities from the
underlying public blockchain transactions was opted-for
in the initial implementation due to its simplicity. It is
envisaged that this approach will serve as an interme-
diary privacy measure whilst more-advanced techniques,
capable of provably maintaining privacy at the blockchain
evel, are developed and tested.

Recent homomorphic encryption techniques appear
o be good candidates for ensuring user’s transactional
privacy at the blockchain level. Grin [16], which is in
active development, leverages the homomorphic prop-
erty of elliptic curve keys under addition to verify fully
encrypted transactions in UTXO systems. This system al-
lows complete secrecy of the underlying values being trans-
erred. Similarly, zk-S(N/T)ARKS are being developed
or Ethereum, in particular the Ethereum-focused frame-
work ZoKrates [62] aims to simplify the creation of zero-
knowledge systems for use on the Ethereum blockchain.
Methodologies such as these, once proven, could be used
o provably mask user transaction data and replace the
simplistic scheme currently proposed.

13This is exactly the case for Ethereum [9], Quorum [48] and Lisk [56].
AKROPOLIS: A GLOBAL BLOCKCHAIN PENSIONS INFRASTRUCTURE 24

Before concluding this section, some comments are
offered regarding the fact that homomorphic encryption
schemes are useful for anonymously providing aggregate
data. When users opt-in to monetise their data (see the
Akropolis Platform Data section), it is plausible that
aggregated private information may be of value. Homo-
morphic encryption is one means of providing aggregated
data privately. For example, an external entity may wish
to know how many properties in China are owned (in part
or fully) by non-Chinese investors/participants. The par-
ticipants could individually encrypt their totals and send
the information to the external agent, who performs addi-
tion on the individual encrypted values. Once finished, a
decryption key held (potentially in part) by the Akropolis
Foundation could decrypt the final value, thereby ensur-
ing that only information about the aggregate value is
received by the external entity, whilst individual users’
data remains private.

9. FUTURE DIRECTIONS

The previous sections described multiple current and fu-
ture technologies that may be integrated into the Akropo-
lis platform. The present section adds some additional
points and highlights some important features that new
technologies will bring to the Akropolis platform.

The Akropolis platform utilises AITs, which abstractly
represent an independent stable coin. In the initial im-
plementation, this will likely be an Akropolis equivalent
of Tether [47]. However, in the future, Akropolis may
incorporate an independent, proven, algorithmic stable
coin,!* such as MakerDAO’s Dai [63], or develop its own
version of an algorithmic stable coin if present coins are
deemed unsuitable. Adopting an independent stable coin
would alleviate the need for tokenising multiple distinct
fiat currencies.

As discussed in the Governance section, Akropolis aims
o gradually decentralise its core components, to the ex-
ent that regulatory and practical considerations permit.
t is envisaged that a DAO-like governing entity will (in-
art or fully) eventually replace the role of the Akropolis
Foundation. Based on existing research, it appears feasi-
ble that the initial steps towards decentralisation could
utilise DAO-governed Token Curated Lists to partially
decentralise the onboarding process of FMs. The over-
all decentralised picture is heavily dependent on future
rogress in decentralised governance models and will ul-
imately be subject to the needs and requirements of
platform users.
Finally, as discussed in the Privacy section, Akropolis
aims to improve the blockchain layer’s privacy by in-
corporating future advancements in privacy-preserving
methodologies. Privacy functionality and features will be-
come increasingly important as the system transitions to
a more decentralised state (which necessarily increases the

dependence on underlying blockchains for data storage).
The transition to a fully-decentralised pension system is
dependent on the capacity of privacy-preserving technolo-
gies to facilitate such a system whilst maintaining user
privacy.

10. CONCLUSION

The dire state of the global pension industry looms
arge as a major economic issue for the coming years. A
global discrepancy between pension assets held and ex-
isting liabilities presents a significant economic challenge
oth for individuals and the wider global economy. Trends
such as increased life expectancies, decreased voluntary
contributions, and reduced ratios of workers to retirees all
exacerbate the stresses on the pension industry. The sys-
emic issues plaguing the pension sector are intricate and
he complexity of addressing these challenges should not
e understated. Yet action must be taken if the economy
is to avoid a pension-induced global financial crisis.

Any solution to the pension crisis must support the
current pension ecosystem, to protect upcoming retirees,
whilst also meeting the needs of an aging population and
facilitating a global inter-generational transition to a new,
economically sustainable system. This presents a complex,
interrelated set of demands and constraints for any candi-
date pension framework. A new pension protocol must
also recognize that workplaces and legislative agendas are
changing. The workforce is being increasingly atomized
and the tendency towards freelancing and a sharing/gig
economy has eroded traditional mechanisms for building
pension savings. Furthermore, to re-assign responsibility
for the forthcoming challenges, states are increasingly
liberalising pensions and shifting the burden of funding
retirement onto the individual. Thus, the modern worker
requires a pension system capable of functioning alongside
the atomization imposed on workers by both the modern
state and workplace.

The pension industry also suffers from systemic issues
relating to poor visibility around fund management, un-
necessarily complicated (or hidden) fee structures, porta-
bility limitations, and compliance regulations which, at
times, are enforced using outdated methodologies. Fur-
thermore, misaligned incentive structures between pension
investors, the funds to which they contribute, and the
fund managers overseeing the underlying assets, further
strain existing pension systems and erode the benefits
returned to pensioners.

The Akropolis platform aims to unify a number of
recent technological advancements to develop and imple-
ment a long-term sustainable solution to the numerous
challenges plaguing the pension industry. Akropolis seeks
to facilitate the transition from existing pension structures
to an atomized, individualised pension protocol capable
of satisfying the needs of modern workers. The Akropolis

144 coin that is not 1-to-1 backed with a collateralised asset, but instead either algorithmically bound to a collateralised volatile token

AKROPOLIS: A GLOBAL BLOCKCHAIN PENSIONS INFRASTRUCTURE 25,

platform will deliver a portable pension infrastructure
capable of supporting the modern worker along their in-
dividual (global) journey in an environment beholden to
changing legislative demands and workplace conditions.
Fundamentally, the platform aims to leverage the trans-
parency, automaticity, and auditability of decentralized
ledgers to provide new tools that balance the competing
demands of workers, Pension Funds, and Fund Managers,
whilst delivering the flexibility, accountability, and regula-
ory compliance required of a pension service. Akropolis
is a global platform and will connect everyday users with
a range of experienced pension funds, products and ser-
vices. Importantly, the Akropolis platform incorporates
game-theoretic incentive structures to mitigate against
excessive fees (traditionally borne by users in the pen-
sion industry) while simultaneously fostering new levels
of transparency.

Akropolis will act as a single source of pension truth for
the individual, collating their existing pension products,
together with new pension products, collectively under
a single account tied to the individual’s identity. The
tokenisation of pension assets and products will enable
new ways for individuals to engage with their holdings

and new ways for Pension Funds and Fund Managers to
engage with clients. New classes of services are possible,
ranging from the monetisation of user’s data (should they
opt-in), to the direct marketing and delivery of relevant,
related pension products, through to the delivery of de-
centralised pension platforms with in-built accountability,
transparency and governance protocols.

The utilisation of blockchain technologies is not a cure-
all for the pension industry, yet it is clear that these de-
veloping technologies offer new solutions to the challenges
faced by the sector. Akropolis is partnering with leading
experts in the pension industry and leading blockchain
projects to tackle the global pension crisis as a community.
The goal of the Akropolis project is to develop a transpar-
ent, accountable and portable pension infrastructure that
can deliver pension services that meet the needs of the
modern workforce. Overcoming the challenges in existing
pension structures is a non-trivial task. Yet Akropolis
believes that leveraging new decentralised technologies,
to empower the community to come together and tackle
the pension problem, offers the best hope for both rectify-
ing existing systemic failures and building a sustainable
future.

These institutional funds act similarly to individual users on the Akropolis platform but control the pension
products of multiple/many individuals.

e PoS: Proof of Stake (consensus mechanism).
e PoW: Proof of Work (consensus mechanism).

APPENDIX B. USER JOURNEY AND BASIC OPTIONS

Aspects of the user journey and basic options/functions are described below.

(7)

(8)

Registration — Users sign up with an email and password. This initial interaction with the Akropolis
platform incorporates a concise explanation of basic system features. Users are not initially burdened with
blockchain specific actions like an account (keys) generation or transaction signing. Registration does not
require but instead allows users to explore the application and gradually build up the trust needed to submit
to a full screening process.
Verification — Users may upgrade their basic (initial) account to unlock investment options by uploading
appropriate identification documents and certificates. The three categories of accounts are thus:

e Basic Level — The default level, showcases the application/platform before a user is ready to create a full
investment level account.

e Investment Compliant — Available after identification documents are supplied.

e Pension Fund Compliant — Relevant for institutional participants.

Feed data from legacy pension funds — Users may import data from legacy pension fund providers,
thereby collating all their pension/savings information in a single place. Functionality will be similar to Pensions
Dashboard [64].
Saving Account Creation — Users may create a new pot or transfer an existing savings account from a
different pension fund. New savings pots may be assigned as pensions savings (which imposes certain regulatory
demands, such as time-locking requirements, and avails privileges such as tax relief) or as unrestricted savings
(which act as a standard investment account).
Saving Pot Configuration — There will be three different modes of savings management:

e Self-managed — The user is responsible for asset selection and trading. There are no management and
performance fees. Recommended for advanced users with investment experience.

e Advised — The user has control over, and responsibility for, their investments but receives personalised
suggestions/advice regarding their current savings, risk level and investment horizons. Acting on the advice
is straight forward, requiring users to click on an agree/decline button to trigger automatic execution (in
some cases). Advisors may be ranked according to their past performance (as stored on-chain) and can
charge fees for their service.

e Pension Fund Operated — The user delegates investment responsibilities to an institutional pension fund.
The fund is responsible for all investment decisions and may collect a fee based on performance or volume
under custody.

Defining Contribution — Users may define an initial contribution and/or commit to periodic contributions
to be debited from their account. Options for assigning employer contributions will also be available.

Assets trading — Users with self-managed portfolios are responsible for managing trades, otherwise trading
activities are outsourced to a pension fund. A user may submit a buy/sell bid stating the desired price and
wait for a counterparty to settle the deal.

Investment monitoring — Users can monitor the value of savings pot and obtain information about
investment performance and fess incurred. Options for executing portfolio stress-testing will be available.

(9) Third-party add-ons — Pension funds and users may add tools and services provided by third party
developers and software studios. Application producers may need to obtain a licence by staking AKTs. All
applicants will undergo a verification/vetting process before being available to users. Developers may collect
fees for application usage.

(10) Benefits Payments — Users can individualise their benefit payment structures, subject to regulatory
requirements.

APPENDIX C. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

C.1. OVERVIEW

To serve the long-term needs of the pension market, the Akropolis platform must adopt a number of key design
principles to ensure it is resilient, fault tolerant, flexible, and relevant in an evolving technological landscape. Inevitably
this will involve new blockchain architectures, oracles and third-party components that emerge and replace obsolete
technologies. Furthermore, it is critical to create a platform architecture that can adapt and respond to new quantum
resistant cryptographic security requirements, as appropriate. Given the immutable nature of smart contracts, these
issues have to be carefully considered.

will be produced, both relying on the REST API exposed by Akropolis backend microservices along with the requisite
wallet and private key support. These applications will be secured with multiple layers of authentication. Design for
UI/UX and specific architecture choices for the applications will derive from the business case and users’ needs.

C.3. CORE ARCHITECTURAL COMPONENTS
C.3.1. BLOCKCHAIN AND SMART CONTRACTS

Institutional users may prefer to engage with a private blockchain solution for a variety of reasons, whilst the
public chain will function in a more decentralised manner. The Akropolis platform will be protocol agnostic. As
such, Akropolis will represent a network of public and private blockchains, with Ethereum being the primary protocol
initially, followed by other blockchains as the platform evolves.

The ratio of centralised to decentralised capabilities is anticipated to evolve with time, reflecting both general
changes in inter-generational saving patterns and the pursuit of transparency and accountability gains that may be
achieved by replacing a pension fund activity with smart contracts. Subject to marketplace capabilities and transaction
costs, Akropolis may seek to develop its own blockchain. This could provide cost advantages and enable more tightly
integrated smart contract and protocol capabilities. Ultimately the platform will engage with multiple blockchains and
as the number of blockchain protocols increases, the platform will need to flexibly manage a diverse range of smart
contracts and their blockchain interactions.

The platform’s core smart contract components act as the mediator of logic and validates the implementation of
allocation actions. The initial version smart contract will be written in Solidity, a Turing-complete language that
possesses sufficient flexibility to implement the required logic. Akropolis may also use other blockchains such as
Adjoint.io’s uplink which contains a non-Turing-complete financial scripting language for some security sensitive
transactions. To evolve smart contracts and meet future requirements, a “Factory model” will be used in which
administrative contracts manage the introduction of new smart contract capabilities.

C.3.2. ORACLE SERVICES

Blockchain smart contracts cannot directly retrieve external data, necessitating intermediary services referred to as
Oracles. Third party oracle services are agents that typically work by finding and verifying the required external data
and then submitting or pushing this information into a target smart contract on the blockchain. An example of desired
external data is financial asset price feed information. Oracle services will be required to provide users with up-to-date
information regarding fund performance and asset pricing. Asset tokenisation provides new ways for asset holders to
interact with oracle services and access blockchain-external data.

C.4. ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
C.4.1. RESILIENCE, SCALABILITY AND PERFORMANCE

Blockchain networks are typically highly fault tolerant and resilient. However, they don’t scale well when time
sensitive transactions are involved, given the inherent nature of consensus algorithms and numerous resource constraints
of each participant. Consequently, for Akropolis capabilities that require scalable, time sensitive transactions or data
feeds, such as asset pricing, a combination of high-speed exchange gateways and data oracles will be adopted. In the
case of private or permissioned blockchains, this is addressed through a combination of CDN delivered shared assets
and highly elastic and fault tolerant infrastructures for selected participants or clusters thereof, as shown in Figure 8.

For key parts of the above core infrastructure, where the solution has to scale across dispersed geographies, an
auto-scaling topology will be implemented allowing for transaction execution and data storage to dynamically respond
to, and recover from, performance bottlenecks and faults. Containerised, stateless and non-snowflake design patterns are
crucial to achieve resilience, scalability and performance objectives (for example, in the integration and gateway bridging
services context). This is demonstrated in the above figure, with a Kubernetes orchestrated container application
workload for a private-chain deployment.

C.4.2. Security, APIS AND MICRO-SERVICES

Secure, scalable and efficient microservices are an important part of the Akropolis service-oriented backbone. These
microservices are critical to ensure that the end-to-end platform can operate seamlessly both within its own network
and between networks and other third parties. This microservices architecture pattern is shown in Figure 9.

The backend microservices plays the role of primary coordinator of business logic on the Akropolis platform andserves
the following functions:

e Implement identification and authorization, working in conjunction with the smart contracts.
e Handle usage flows and logic for the Assets.
e Receive the events raised by blockchains from the monitoring micro-service.
There will be a RESTful web service for handling requests to the backend micro-service application layer.
Where applicable, to satisfy various KYC and AML requirements, the management of digital identities, associated
validation and access management will be performed using highly secure, end-to-end encryption mechanisms and

multi-factor authentication methods. As existing cryptographic security algorithms gradually become obsolete (e.g.,
RSA and AES) and emerging quantum resistant ones mature (e.g., Ring-LWE and Merkle Hash Trees) Akropolis will
adapt in turn.

C.4.3. DATA PLATFORM

Fundamental to the Akropolis data platform is the requirement to retain a wide variety of data such as asset
information, fund data, oracle-provided information, blockchain and user events occurring throughout the platform, as
well as broader platform related analytical data. The implementation must address various information and reporting
needs as well as provide the ability to detect anomalies and help prevent malicious usage within the Akropolis platform.

Given the variety of data that must be collected and managed with different data processing requirements, a hybrid
data architecture stack will be adopted and collectively referred to as the “Akropolis Data Platform.” This data
architecture will span blockchain storage, a highly available big data platform and other distributed storage technologies
accessed through a supporting microservices layer. The high-level data architecture pattern is illustrated in Figure 10.

C.4.4. THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS, PLATFORMS AND INTEGRATIONS

To provide the highest possible levels of transparency, the platform will:

e Publish approved exchange APIs to guard against the malfunction or hijacking of the Akropolis APIs themselves.

e Publish summary statistics of activity on the platform, such as asset level operation matrices.

e Employ access tokens to pay fees to operate PoA contracts and keep them alive. These can only be generated
by locking AKT into the access token contract.

1. Abstract

Insurance is an important tool for transferring risks. By nature, it is a
form of mutual assistance between different groups. People transfer the
risks that they cannot or do not want to bear to the insurer collectively
and thus pay a small but regular amount in exchange for enormous
economic guarantees. In this way, risks are transferred in the form of

insurance.

Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology. It is accessible to the public,
inalterable and unforgeable, and therefore has the potential to help
humankind turn the concept of an “Internet of value” into a reality.
Blockchain is a fundamental technology for our species’ next phase of
development and will affect all walks of life with its simple but perfect
technical design. Considering their compatibility in many aspects,
blockchain technology and insurance could be highly complementary to
oneanother. Blockchain insurance, a new insurance model, is developing
rapidly and will become an important part of the industry’s

makeup,revolutionizing the traditional industry.

2. Insurance markets
As living standards rise, demand for insurance is ever increasing. This

model of mutual assistance that distributes risks through financial means
8: ZEUSSHIELD SYSTEM

has become widely accepted and is now considered an essential part of
daily life. Life insurance, vehicle insurance, cargo insurance, and various
other insurance products have penetrated society and become strong
guarantees of a happy life. Meanwhile, the insurance industries of major
countries of the world have achieved revenues exceeding one thousand
trillion dollars. Even in the economic downturn, the insurance industry
registered an uptrend and became a major driving force for the global
economy. Table 1 is Munich Re's forecast for the mean annual composite
growth rate of insurance premiums in the world’s various emerging

economies.

3. Industrial weaknesses

Although the insurance industry is still an emerging industry in a global
sense, more and more weaknesses have been identified within it as
society develops rapidly and application technologies are continually
upgraded and replaced. An analysis of the insurance industry shows that

the main problems faced by the industry today include:

3.1 Multiple layers of agents

The traditional insurance industry relies too much on agents, and thus
creating a problem of increasing intermediary costs and undermining
customer interests. By integrating with the blockchain technology, such
problem can not only reduce intermediary steps, but also minimize the

premiums as well as enhancing the user experience.

3.2 Malicious fraud

"Utmost good faith" is a fundamental principle of insurance, which the
insurance entities are required to abide by. In practice, however, utmost
good faith cannot be objectively evaluated; rather it is established on a
trust system. Insurance companies, for example, may conceal their
contract terms out of self-interest, while applicants may cover up their

actual situations in order to gain lower premiums.
2s. ZEUSSHIELD SYSTEM

Moreover, the law of large numbers determines that insurance operations
must realize data sharing across a broader scope. As insurance companies
pursue enormous interests, however, "information asymmetry" between
firms easily occurs. Intentional concealment or uncooperative attitudes
increasemoral hazards in society, particularly the probability of insurance

fraud.

3.3 Serious lack of diversity in insurance products

Many insurance products available in the market have very poor
specificity and applicability, and the insurance clauses are not compiled
stringently enough, thus not satisfying the needs of applicants. Further,
the lack of insurance diversity has also increased market competition,
prevented effective distribution of social resources and even resulted in

the massive waste of resources.

3.4 Moral hazards

Moral hazards have always been a big headache to insurers. For instance,
a car owner may drive less carefully after taking out vehicle insurance,
therefore the insurer has to pay out more in indemnities and the car owner
suffers losses too—this is a scenario where no entity benefits from

insurance service.
2s. ZEUSSHIELD SYSTEM

3.5 Regional restrictions
In view of the differences between the insurance industry supervisory
systems of different countries, the freedom to procure insurance products

across national borders is significantly restricted.

4. Solution

In recent years points of correspondence between new technologies and
the insurance industry have emerged. We hope, therefore, to restructure
the insurance industry on the basis of blockchain and AI technology, and
establish a new insurance ecosystem. We can summarize this

restructuring in the following steps:

4.1 Digital identity + smart contracts

We will provide a technical solution using blockchain to all insurance
companies and upload the insurance business data to the blockchain. We
can use the authenticity and inalterability of information on the
blockchain to address the problem of "self-identification". The digital
identity established on the blockchain can't be altered, removed, edited or
forged. Such digital identities include, but are not limited to, those of
natural persons, and may be expanded to cover vehicles, airplanes and
other physical objects; thus providing all physical entities that require

them with credible digital identities.
2s. ZEUSSHIELD SYSTEM

Meanwhile, the Zeusshield system also allows for smart coded insurance
contracts and more convenient insurance plans. Combining smart
contracts with data management in fields like vehicles, traffic accidents,
electronic medical records and personal information to provide
revolutionary indemnification services.

An example is combining smart contracts and flight data management to
provide a new kind offlight delay insurance—there is infinite room for
growth in this area. Such a blockchain solution can substantially save
operating costs for insurance companies, eliminate unnecessary

intermediary steps and enhance the insurance experience.

4.2 Artificial intelligence module

Insurance industry data used to be complicated and the ability to integrate
it was not available. As a result, the potential value of such massive data
was wasted. With the continual deepening of research in the AI area,
people are gradually coming to realize the potential value of such

enormous data resources.

In the Zeusshield system, we will design the AI module and analyse the
information in blockchain databas to help insurers increase their
performance-price ratios and provide the insured with smart insurance

packages and a stable, secure and trustworthy claims procedure. Coupled
2s. ZEUSSHIELD SYSTEM

with AI technology, the Zeusshield system will have the following

advantages:

4.2.1 Individualized policy and pricing

In traditional actuarial research, the target of research is general statistics,
with individual cases seldom studied. All policyholders are deemed to
have the same level of risk, which is not strictly reasonable. Due to
technical reasons, peer-to-peer (p2p) insurance models cannot be realized.
With an additional AI module, the Zeusshield system offers an accurate
risk control plan and a pricing model and customizes insurance policies
for different customers. For instance, the car owner with a history of
drunk driving will have a higher risk factor while the car owner without
previous traffic violations will have a lower risk factor for traffic accident

insurance.

4.2.2 Targeted marketing
More accurate marketing is possible through the analysis of information
in databases. For instance, refund insurance can be recommended to users

with sensitive skin.

4.2.3 Development of new insurance products

With the popularization of the Internet, people are facing more diversified
2s. ZEUSSHIELD SYSTEM

risks and their demands for insurance tend to be characterized by low
insurance values, high frequency and fragmentation. AI technology can
assist in the design of various insurance products, provide users with rich

insurance packages and enhance user experience.

4.2.4 Smart claim handling and verification

AI modules offer great assistance at the stage of claim handling and
verification. Taking the insurance platform of Ant Financial Services as
an example—image identification technology is one of the key
applications of claim verification. At the claims stage of consumer
insurance, over 90% of the identification and judgment work is

completed by backend technology.

4.3 P2P insurance market

As the plan moves forward, we will establish a P2P insurance platform
that combines both blockchain and AI technologies. In the future, this
platform will serve the insurer and the insured simultaneously. It will take
the system’s original ZSC as a medium to establish a diversified and

highly individualized insurance ecosystem.

The ZSC system can be defined as a decentralized insurance agency

platform. We can provide insurers with new insurance concepts and
2s. ZEUSSHIELD SYSTEM

insurance solutions on the chain. We can optimize the modes of execution
of traditional insurers, reduce their operating costs, prevent losses from

fraud and increase user bases.

Meanwhile, we will also serve policyholders, satisfying their needs for
risk transfer and providing individualized insurance package solutions.
Policyholders will be able to choose any insurance product on the
platform through the system terminal. Moreover, the Al-based platform

will also be able to offer new insurance concepts to insurance suppliers.

As a platform, we witness the contract process between the insurer and
the insured and levy necessary handling charges and commissions. As the
method of payment, ZSC will be partially used to construct the
bottommost insurance and reinsurance capital pools, and provide the
services to traditional insurers making more in-service fees, thus
generating a beneficial cycle. Either AppStore or Taobao can be referred
to regarding the main operating model for the platform. (See 6.4.2 for a

detailed description of the capital pool module.)

4.4 Summary
According to relevant research statistics, FinTech had an application

index of 33% in 2017, which shows that financial technology has moved
2s. ZEUSSHIELD SYSTEM

from the early adopters phase in 2015 towards the early majority phase
(Rogers Adoption/InnovationCurve classification). FinTech companies
are continually raising their status on the market and can already
influence industrial standards and consumer expectations. With the
continuous updating of technologies, FinTech will thoroughly
revolutionize the traditional financial industry and become an

indispensable part of our daily lives.

As FinTech’s two core technologies, blockchain and AI have attracted an
enormous amount of interest across the world. In the 27th European
Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC) in Finland on
June 12, 2017, Mr. Pekka Soini, head of the National Technical
Innovation Bureau of Finland, emphasized the importance of blockchain
technology and AI and included them in the four core technologies of the

next 10 to 20 years.

As an important branch of the financial industry and due to its unique
features, the insurance industry is naturally compatible with blockchain
and AI technology. In the future, the Al-based blockchain insurance
models will address the weaknesses of the insurance industry and bring
peoplea new insurance experience. Such an insurance model is fully

based on an information society and will provide distributed,
2s. ZEUSSHIELD SYSTEM

contextualized and digitalized new insurance services.

5. Why Ethereum?
5.1 Ethereum
Ethereum was initiated by whiz kid Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and 2014 with
the aim of developing a "next-generation encrypted currency and
decentralized application platform", which started development in 2014.
The whole Ethereum system is realized by open source code and its core
is the public blockchain platform based on Ether, the special encrypted
currency. On this platform, Ethereum provides a decentralized Ethereum
virtual machine to make it convenient for third-party developers to realize
Ethereum-based smart contracts. An Ethereum virtual machine allows
third-party developers to easily and conveniently reuse the blockchain
core system as defined by the Ethereum and focus their R&D work on the
application of blockchain. For that reason, more and more individuals,
teams and companies are favouring Ethereum-based R&D and the use of
distributed applications. This is leading to diversification of the Ethereum
ecosystem and the creation of diversified applications.

e When comparing it to other blockchain technologies, the Ethereum

platform has the following main features:

e Smart contracts: the contract programs developed by third-party
2s. ZEUSSHIELD SYSTEM

developers can be stored at a node on the Ethereum blockchain and
tun at that node. For the purpose of operation, the program operator
needs to pay commissions to the miners or stakeholders of the node
where the program is located.

e Uncle blocks: it incorporates the short blockchains that have not
been included on the mother chain due to relatively slow mining
speeds. Directed acyclic graph (DAG) related technology is
adopted.

e Proof-of-stake: it is an improvement on the current POW
(proof-of-work)based mining algorithm and can save considerable
computer resources needed for mining and avoid the network
centralization arising from integrated circuits for special

applications.

5.2 Smart contracts

If blockchain is the core technology that Ethereum uses for data
processing, the smart contract system is the core technology that
Ethereum uses for the processing of various applications. The
crucialthing supporting the smart contract system is the Ethereum virtual
machine. It provides a set of Turing-complete programming languages
that are similar to the assembly language that can execute the code of any

complicated algorithm for the bridging of data processing and application
2s. ZEUSSHIELD SYSTEM

processing. As it is very painful for a developer to directly use this set of
Turing-complete languages for programming, Ethereum provides one
senior language, Solidity, which is similar to C/C++. Today, Microsoft's
main software product—Microsoft Visual Studio—has started to offer the

Solidity programming language to program developers.

Based on the Ethereum virtual machine and Solidity programming
language, a third-party developer can develop an Ethereum smart contract.
Put simply, each contract is a distributed application based on the
Ethereum blockchain system. When a developer launches a contract on
the Etherum platform, this contract is like an application agent living in
the Ethereum platform. It has its Ether address for Ether transactions, data
exchanges between the founder and other users, and execution of
application with complex logic, for example establishing one

Ethereum-based token system and one decentralized autonomous group.

To allow an equivalent value system to be more effectively and
conveniently reflected in an application based on Ethereum platform, the
Ethereum and its smart contract system are designed according to the
following principles:

e Simplicity: as the data processing part of the blockchain is already

packaged at the bottom layer of the Ethereum platform, an ordinary
2s. ZEUSSHIELD SYSTEM

programmer can perfectly develop a simple smart contract and
create a distributed application with complex logic. This will
finally help to lower the technical threshold for blockchain-based
development and promote the process of opening up Ehtereum to
all users.

e Generality: based on the Ethereum virtual machine, a developer
and even an ordinary Ethereum user can establish any smart
contract or transaction type that can be accurately defined.

e Modularity: the system makeup of Ethereum is designed to be as
modular and divisible as possible. The benefits of this design can
be continuously improved based on the internal functionality of
Etherum, and its performance can also be improved. Meanwhile,
the whole system is stable, scalable and secure and allows for the
continuous proper operation of smart contracts based on the
Ethereum virtual machine without making any changes.

e Non-discriminatory: the Ethereum platform does not voluntarily
restrict or block smart contracts of any given type; it does not
attempt to object to the unwanted application of a specific type.
The cost of running the application is the payment for the
corresponding trading expenses according to the program's

calculation steps.

6. Zeusshield System

6.1 System framework

According to the above-mentioned weaknesses and development
bottlenecks of the insurance industry, and relying on the advantages of
blockchain technology, we have designed a smart insurance management
system based on the Ethereum platform called Zeusshield System. As
shown in Figure 1, the Zeusshield system mainly comprises four parts:
Zeus Shield Coin (ZSC) based on the Ethereum ERC 20 protocol, the
(distributed) database management subsystem, the module management

subsystem, and the webpage and smartphone-based Zeusshield client.

6.2 Zeus Shield Coin
Zeus Shield Coin (ZSC) is the token, which is developed on the basis of
the Ethereum ERC20 protocol. ZSC is used to establish an insurance

capital pool and a reinsurance capital pool in order to improve cash flows

frominsurance contracts. This service can be provided to insurersas
required. As this project progresses, the insurance ecosystemwill
gradually improve. As the original token of the system, ZSC will offer

more and more functions.

6.3 Database management subsystem

In order to increase the efficiency of data processing based on the
Zeusshield System, all text-based information will be stored primarily on
the Ethereum platform. Image and video files will be encrypted and

safely stored on a service independent from the Ethereum platform.

As Figure 2 shows, the database on the Ethereum platform has four main
parts—the insurance receiving units database, the insurance supplying

units database, the insurance contracts database and the self-defined

19
2s. ZEUSSHIELD SYSTEM

insurance products database. As the bottom layer of the Ethereum
platform is based on distributed blockchains, the confidentiality, security
and inalterability of relevant data in the four parts can be very effectively

guaranteed.

6.3.1 Insurance receiving units and insurance supplying units databases

Insurance receiving units and insurance supplying units are two key user
types of the Zeusshield system. As the name indicates, the insurance
receiving unit is the physical entity that receives insurance services. A
specific insurance receiving unit may be an individual, family, company
or community. After the Zeusshield system is launched online, we will be
able to establish more types of insurance receiving units according to
actual business demands. Correspondingly, the insurance supplying units
refers to the physical entities that supply insurance services. On the basis
of the equivalent value system of the blockchain and in contrast to
traditional insurance systems, the Zeusshield system provides an open
platform that allows different types of insurance supply units to provide
their insurance services. For instance, an insurance supply unit may be an
insurance company, a team comprising multiple individuals or

combinations of individuals and insurance companies.

20
2s. ZEUSSHIELD SYSTEM

6.3.2 Insurance contracts database

The insurance contracts database stores the corresponding insurance
contracts or agreements signed between different insurance receiving
units and insurance supplying units. Each insurance contract defines the
corresponding insurance premium transaction mode and indemnification
mode. Thanks to the security and inalterability of the Ethereum
blockchain, the Zeusshield system can prevent insurance receiving units
being affected by timing, geological or human factors when the claim
conditions are satisfied and enable them to receive insurance payouts

quickly and conveniently.

6.3.3 Self-defined insurance product database

The insurance services needed by insurance receiving units and insurance
supplying units are stored in the self-defined insurance products database.
The type and model of insurance can be proposed by the insurance
receiving unit according to actual demand or provided by the insurance
supplying unit according to its market analysis. Once these services are
defined, the Zeusshield system will provide them to its users. The user
may then sign the corresponding insurance service contract via the
Zeusshield system. The executed insurance service contract will be

included in the insurance contracts database.

21
2s. ZEUSSHIELD SYSTEM

6.4 Module management subsystem

The Zeusshield system provides different modules for smart database
management and smart support for insurance services, wherein the three
main modules are an AI module, a capital pool module and a client

interface module.

6.4.1 AI module
The AI module delivers two main features—big data analysis and

increased analysis efficiency through parallel computing.

6.4.1.1 Big data analysis

Big data analysis, as a feature of the AI module, offers multiple smart
features to Zeusshield system users—for example, customization of
special insurance services, insurance package recommendations, smart
selection of insurance products, insurance product risk analysis and image

identification during indemnification.

Big data analysis is adopted primarily because the Zeusshield system
provides one set of open features for self-defining insurance products so
that insurance products can be developed in a more extensive, flexible,
scalable and market-oriented manner. However, an ordinary insurance

service developer (insurance receiving or insurance supplying unit) faces

22
“#5. ZEUSSHIELD SYSTEM

a very important problem—how to establish a complete and accurate
business model, including insurance premiums, insurance indemnification
conditions and amounts to be indemnified. Meanwhile, the insurance
receiving unit faces a further important issue—how to find an insurance
product that suits its actual needs from a multitude of insurance products,
while guaranteeing its highest performance-price ratio.

6.4.1.2 Parallel computing

Big data analysis is primarily conducted via deep learning in the
Zeusshield system =~ oo on distributed network
architecture have the capacity for natural parallel data processing,anda
hot topic of research in the field of deep learning today is machine

learning and parallel computing.

The main purpose of machine learning is training a neural network (e.g.
convolutional computing) via captured data to establish a data module
and thus help the system to effectively forecast the corresponding
feedback after the capture of new data—for instance, in the service
customization, recommendation and_ service selection and
recommendation mentioned above (see the annex for detailed

descriptions of deep learning).

To increase the validity of the forecast, however, it is necessary to use

23
2s. ZEUSSHIELD SYSTEM

large amounts of data and repeated data learning and training. If a
single-threaded mode is adopted as the training mode, considerable
resources (e.g. CPU, GPU, memory and time) will betaken up, thus
introducing a mode that requires parallel computing. As the blockchain
and smart contract system of Ethereum are based on a distributed
architecture with multiple nodes, it helps to distribute the learning data
and learning procedures to different Ethereum nodes for parallel data

learning.

6.4.2 Capital pool module

The Zeusshield system will record and analyse each insurance business
and the ZSC capital circulation. Relevant analytical results will help the
insurance supplying unit to make a detailed and accurate calculation of
incomefrom thepremiumsof its insurance products. According to the
actuarial results, the Zeusshield system will support two different
insurance and reinsurance capital pools—unit-level capital pools and

system-level capital pools.

A unit-level capital pool needs to be supplied and maintained by each
insurance supplying unit. The insurance supplying unit may gather
income from premiums into a capital pool and adjust its insurance

services on a real-time basis according to the income-from-premiums

24
2s. ZEUSSHIELD SYSTEM

calculation. In this way, the capital pool can continuously ensure income
from premiums is higher than the costs of indemnity payments. In this
way, the insurance supplying unit can maintain a stable capital pool with
capital surplus and stable growth. The capital surplus will be partially
used to cover indemnity expenses, with the remaining part used for other
insurance operations to generate more income.

The Zeusshield system will establish a system-level insurance and
reinsurance capital pool which primarily works to support insurance
supplying units in the reasonable handling of rare cases when the capital
pool is not enough to cover costs of indemnity payments; thus protecting

the legal rights and interests of insurance receiving units.

6.4.3 Interface module

The interface module contains the client interface and the Ethereum
external data interface, wherein the client interface enables the system
user to conveniently, rapidly and securely use the Zeusshield system via
its client. The Ethereum external data interface primarily works to allow

the system to communicate with the external data server.

6.5 Zeusshield client
The Zeusshield client is an application for exchange and communication

between the system and its users. We will develop a webpage and

25
ZEUSSHIELD SYSTEM

smartphone-based client for our users. Meanwhile, we will also provide
an open application programming interface (API) for the convenience of

third-party developers.

6.6 Zeusshield system's operating logic
Put simply, Zeusshield system is an insurance-based P2P market platform.

For insurance supplying units, it is first necessary to apply to Zeusshield
Blockchain Technology Development Co., Ltd for a space in the system.
Applications will be examined and approved on the basis of multiple

factors—such as, the supplying unit’s capital support and reputation.

2s. ZEUSSHIELD SYSTEM

Once approved, the insurance supplying unit needs to transfer a certain
amount of capital into the blockchain-based digital currency system to
establish the supply-level capital pool. The inbound capital may be in
Ether or ZSC. Thereafter, the insurance supplying unit may produce and
display different insurance products through the Zeusshield system, and
potential insurance receiving units can choose from them.

When an insurance product is selected, the insurance receiving unit needs
to sign an insurance contract with the corresponding insurance supplying
unit and pay relevant expenses in a digital currency, either ETH or ZSC.
The payment comprises three parts: the first part is paid to the insurance
supply unit; the second part is the service charge paid to Zeusshield
Blockchain Technology Development Co., Ltd at a certain ratio; the third
part is the transaction fee which shall be paid in ZSC only. The used ZSC

will be recycled by the system to establish a system-level capital pool.

Moreover, if the insurance supplying unit needs to use the system-level

capital pool, it has to pay certain service charges to Zeusshield

Blockchain Technology Development Co., Ltd.

7. The Zeusshield Board of Directors

7.1 Makeup

The Zeusshield Board of Directors comprises a core team oriented
towards the same goal and it is a valid management team established on
the basis of a blockchain smart contract. The board members share a
common understanding of the prospects for future applications of
blockchain insurance and hold the same concepts regarding the

Company's operation and development.

7.2 Main tasks

The board of directors are the founders, executives and guardians of ZSC
smart contracts. From the beginning of the design and through the
building of the blockchain-based smart contracts, they could foresee
future operating modes and the possible benefits for all participants. The
board of directors proposes strategic guidance on ZSC, allowing the ZSC

design to be adequately forward-looking and practical.

The board of directors is the company's management body liable for the
present and future interests of ZSC token owners and ensures the healthy
running of the ZSC system. “We will provide outstanding user
experience to customers. We also aim to provide a transparent and fair

management model for our users, partners and team members.”

2s. ZEUSSHIELD SYSTEM

7.3 Nature of the board of directors

The board of directors is an innovative management mechanism working
in an open, transparent and supervised manner. In operational design, the
board applies the essential features of blockchain technology in its
practical operations and thus revolutionizes the traditional operating and
management concepts of a board of directors. Our board's
resolution-making process directly interfaces with smart contracts, with
the conventional legal contract is converted into blockchain language.
One-click voting links make it easier to execute and implement board
resolutions, which thus become fair and transparent smart executive
orders. The board has a decision-making and supervisory role in the
strategic guidance, risk management supervision, management succession
planning and accomplishment of other basic tasks; it also provides system

maintenance, ensuring the proper operation of the ZSC system.

Zeusshield performs its supervisory work through risk forecasts and
mechanism improvements. It aims to identify and expose problems,
eliminate loopholes and optimize mechanisms. In the future, the company
will authorize frontline staff via smart contracts using blockchain
technology and perform field supervision and multi-platform
management on behalf of all TSC owners. The board releases powerful

and unique messages, listens to proposals and take actions for the

29
2s. ZEUSSHIELD SYSTEM

continuous optimization of management; it takes advantage of social
media, emphasizing its efficient application and its use for carrying out
candid exchanges; it has put in place procedures to effectively control

information disclosure to ensure the reliability of public reporting.

8.6 Future development of community fund

At a certain point in the future, when the community fund has reached a
certain development stage and conditions are ripe, the Zeusshield
Community Fund will consider establishing a ZSC-based operational
token allowing members of the fund to make greater returns. This will be

conducive to the development and expansion of the Fund.

8.7 Most favoured partners of the Zeusshield Community Fund

In order to better implement new insurance concepts, the Zeusshield
Community Fund will favour and prioritize partnership with innovative
enterprises with hi-tech products. New ways of thinking, new
technologies, and new insurance concepts and products are our priorities
and development goals. We wish to deliver brand-new insurance products
to enterprises in the new energy, hi-tech and astronautics sectors that go
beyond what conventional insurance companies are able to offer in terms
of capability and daring. New concepts and new insurance logic will be

the priorities of the Zeusshield Community Fund.

8.8 Zeusshield Community Fund and Zeusshield Board of Directors

The Zeusshield Community Fund is part of the Zeusshield Board of
Directors but operates independently. It updates the board of directors and
the community quarterly on the progress and aims of different projectsin
an open and transparent manner, providing information about fund usage
and accounts details. The Zeusshield Community Fund as we have
defined it will be the original driving force behindthe Zeusshield
Community. It reports to the board of directors and runs independently
from the board of directors. As you can see, the members of our
Community Fund are all senior professionals from the blockchain,
insurance, hi-tech and actuarial sectors. We feel highly honoured to have
them as our colleagues, promoting the progress of blockchain application

together.

The Zeusshield Funds in different continents will continue to attract
outstanding members. Committed to the principle of good faith disclosure,
we will provide honest and accurate reporting of the latest information
regarding the Zeusshield Community and project updates on our official

12. Annexes

12.1 Deep learning

The main areas of research for deep learning are machine learning and
parallel computing. The main purpose of machine learning is to establish
a data module that helps the system to effectively forecast corresponding
feedbacks after capture of new data by training neural networks using
already captured data—for example, in applications such as the
customized service recommendations and _ service _ selection
recommendations mentioned above. However, to increase the validity of
forecasts it is necessary to use large amounts of data and repeated data
learning and training. If a single-thread mode is adopted as the training
mode, considerable resources (e.g. CPU, GPU, memory and time) are
taken up, thus introducing a mode that requires parallel computing. As the
Ethereum blockchain and smart contract system are based on a distributed
architecture with multiple nodes, it helps to distribute the learning data
and learning procedures to different Ethereum nodes for parallel data

learning.

Big data analysis based on deep learning primarily includes modelling
and prediction (also known as “interface’”). Modelling refers to learning
from existing data to find out about its specific data mode and thus

establish a model for forecasting new data. In practice, the most

40
38: ZEUSSHIELD SYSTEM

appropriate model is adopted on the basis of various models acquired in
order to analyse the newly acquired data and forecast its unique data

mode, as shown in Figure 5.

Further, Figure 6 shows that the basic principle of modelling is to
repeatedly train the system through various different algorithms of the
neural network in order to accurately calculate the impact, or weight, of
each neuron on the next neuron from the input layer to the output layer in
the neural network. The primary neural network algorithms include deep
neural networks (DNN), deep belief networks (DBN), convolutional
neuron networks (CNN) and convolutional deep belief networks (CDBN).
Different neural network algorithms give rise to different problems,

primarily involving accuracy and time of computing.
 ZEUSSHIELD SYSTEM

Layer 1 . Layer k
Figure 6 Nerve Net and Impacts of Weight of Neuron

Now, we will take DNN as an example to introduce how deep learning
goes on. DNN networks are based on the principle of a discriminative
model. A back propagation algorithm is adopted for learning and training
and the most important part is updating the weight of each neuron in the

following formula:

ac
dw;(k)

AW(k t+1)=Aw(k +7

According to Figure 6 and the formula above, we know that wy (k, #)
represents the impact of neuron 7 in layer k of the neural network on
neuron j in layer k+1 of the neural network, wherein 1 is the learning rate
and C is the cost function. The selection of cost function is related to the
type of learning (e.g. supervised learning, non-supervised learning and

enhanced learning) and the activation function. On the basis of this

42
ZEUSSHIELD SYSTEM

function, AI modules can perform repeated learning according to the

input data and finally calculate an accurate weight.

can see that the possible letter combinations include XXY and YXY if

two letters X and Y are input.

12.2 Zeusshield system's deep learning

In the Zeusshield system, we adopt Ethereum local and external deep
learning to realize accurate modelling.

Local deep learning refers to the Zeusshield system's data analysis of the

textual information stored on the Ethereum platform in order to acquire a

43

key model for forecasting future data. With reference to the example
quoted in Figure 8, the forecast information given by this model may
include the insured’s acceptable level of premium, pre-warning of risks or

preferences for certain types of insurance.

Data

| Flight delay statistics Hotel service quality statistics
| Dining and food statistics Tourism and scenic spot evaluation |

Figure 8 Risk Pre-warning and Insurance Proposal

External deep learning refers to our utilization of other commercialized
cloud computing platforms—for example, Ali Cloud, Amazon, for data
analysis of the image and video information stored outside the Etherum
and establishment of a reliable model. Its benefit lies in the possibility to
initially verify users’ image-based authentication and thus provide a

reference for subsequent indemnification work.

Moreover, the Zeusshield system will also provide a privacy protection
mechanism to protect the personal information of users during the AI

module's deep learning.

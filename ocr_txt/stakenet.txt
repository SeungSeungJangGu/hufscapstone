1. ABSTRACT- 4th Generation DLT

As we move through a 3rd generation wave of blockchains it is important to understand which tech-
nologies, communities and Decentralized Ledger Technologies (DLT’s) will separate themselves from
the rest, pushing through the noise of constant ventures entering the crypto-sphere. Instead of a“one
chain rule” however; we believe the future will instead be the formation of a global backend - a 4th
generation blockchain mesh consisting of every chain, technology and service created thus far. A
united network of different tech from different chains fully communicating as one entity executing
synchronously. A future where one powers software to run their vehicle, buys groceries, or signs con-
tracts instantly using different chains will be amongst us, constantly evolving to fit users needs on the
fly. This conversion will be completely unbeknownst to end users as swaps will be done case by case
on the backend, not seen, realized, or even chosen by the user.

How clo we get there?

A requirement and first step towards a chain participating in this cross chain “meta network” will be
the ability to autonomously swap fluidly back and forth between assets in a trustless instant manner.
We will first transform our chain into a multi-currency wallet which will enable it to hold, send and
receive balances and will provide us with our solid foundation. This foundation will allow smooth
transitions into cross chain capabilities and thereafter, this functionality will be enabled onto our
chain, known as a Decentralized Exchange (DEX).

Decentralized Exchange

The power and implications of a decentralized exchange are often overlooked. The ability to morph
assets instantly from one chain to another in a trustless manner gives massive power to the individu-
als of a given system as well as the system itself. Think of how difficult it is to convert assets in our
current financial model, let alone done peer-to-peer - nearly impossible. To this point exchanges have
been swapping assets tailored specifically for accredited institutions to oversee by central authorities
—they have been financial vehicles and not much more. Due to utility traits of tokens, and the fact
that ownership is never conceded the entire definition of an “exchange” changes. When a user exe-
cutes an exchange for example it will empower him instantly with all features and functions that
come with the resulting swap. When sleeping, working, cooking, driving etc there will be certain
chains that enhance different human experiences. A given individuals net worth will constantly be
evolving form to accommodate it's owner in the most efficient way possible. XSN sees the future of
wealth in a new light - as alive, intimately involved enhancing our lives in real-time in a way that has
never before been realized. We understand there will be different utility needed in different situations
and rather than compete with new tech we will engineer ourselves to integrate new chains easily into

our system.

In 1991 James Cameron directed and released a film about an artificial intelligence that became self
aware and fought against humanity. The infamous antagonist “T-1000” would download data and
morph into objects it came across and observed—the movie was a hit partly because it was quite
conceivable to be reality amongst critics and technologists alike. There is no reason networks
shouldn't be able to have this same ability - to fluidly download and replicate any and all peer
networks which it connects. We are seeing the beginnings of this meta-connection now with emerg-
ing off chain technologies (lightning, raiden etc). Combined with the use of second layers we will also
be able to run nodes while providing full functionality, liquidity, and communications between all.
Cross chain nodes are coming and XSN will be first in line to lead this newly disruptive technology.

3. BACKGROUND

In the last few years, the cryptocurrency community has steadily grown. However, the fact remains
that this community is still in the early stages of expansion, and is a continuously expanding market
which offers great opportunities for traders all around the world. Presently, there are over 1,600 cryp-
tocurrencies, above 10,450 markets and a total market cap of nearly $400 billion as per statistics avail-
able at coinmarketcap.com. In 2017, the prices of popular virtual currencies such as Bitcoin and
Ethereum soared to record highs amid increased investor interest.

There are now hundreds of cryptocurrencies to choose from - with more appearing each passing day.
Choice paralyzes - this adds cost, complexity and the need for advice. Given that cryptocurrency can
be high risk, has extreme volatility, and can be difficult to buy and store safely, an effective and diverse
portfolio of coins (cryptocurrencies) can be a complex problem.

Furthermore, these cryptocurrencies seem to be failing when it comes to general acceptance and
usability, where these projects have failed to identify and address the main issues present in making
mass adoption of digital assets possible. The main reasons are lack of security, acceptability, high
exchange and trading fees, liquidity issues and volatility of the market. Numerous steps are often
involved in seeing the real use of one’s digital assets. Despite the growing appeal of cryptocurrencies,
the usability of these digital assets remains limited - a hurdle that has kept it from achieving more
rapid, widespread adoption.

Aside from general usability, digital currencies have become a source of the high margin of profits

considering its ample trading opportunities. However, at the same time, it may also be noted that
trading or investing in cryptocurrencies is complex and time-consuming. A trader not only needs to
understand the complexities of trading, but also being able to cope with the rapidly growing cryp-
tocurrency market. Considering the fact that the crypto market is forever open on a 24/7 basis and
can be highly volatile, in order for a trader to be successful, they need to be constantly monitoring
their trades, and monitoring trends to give them the information to make the right decision - this is
a tricky task that involves deep analysis of market trends and gaining the right information. Thus,
having all these complexities, it is natural to ask for a way, where one can get rid of these hindrances
and invest in the right cryptocurrency to gain maximum profits.

StakeNet (XSN) is a state of the art ecosystem that aims to resolve all these issues by providing users
with a cryptocurrency and a platform that provides features such as easy and secure staking, a fast,
private, and innovative blockchain using masternodes, lightning network, security algorithms, Cross
Chain Proof of Stake (CCPoS), etc. and provide usability/acceptability by creating a network of mer-
chants that accept XSN as a mode of payment.

Ledger

POSW

Coin Wallet
POS

StakeNet, with the ticker XSN, is a Trustless Proof of Stake cryptocurrency created using the X11 algo-
rithm that allows users to stake various cryptocurrencies in one single wallet. StakeNet addresses the
issue of staking for nontechnical people by providing a simple user interface at stakenet.io, and
accepting term deposits, membership and selling other merchandise to support Revolving Stake
Bonus (RSB) to XSN holders. StakeNet focuses on technology improvements on the blockchain level,
aims to improve the coin by introducing Trustless Proof of Stake (TPoS), which enables cold wallet
staking, lightning network, atomic swaps, multi-currency wallet and Cross Chain Proof of Stake
(CCPoS) functionalities. These tech improvements really push the boundaries so that XSN will keep up
with other coins technological improvement, which will allow XSN to always stay relevant and be a
store of value.

WHAT DOES XSN DO?

XSN is the world's first Trustless Proof of Stake (TPoS) coin that allows its users to safely, and conven-
iently, stake their XSN coins in cold wallet storage, for example using Ledger hardware wallets.
Owners of the XSN Coin will be able to stake their coins effortlessly by setting up a contract with a
merchant - allowing the merchant to stake the owner's coins without the need for total control over
the coins. Along with TPoS technology, StakeNet will implement state of the art features such as
Lightning Network, XSN atomic swaps, Masternodes, Enhanced Privacy, and the innovative Cross
Chain architecture that allows for inter chain capabilities.

BLOCK REWARDS

The block rewards for XSN are split between masternodes, staking nodes, and treasury. Masternodes
will receive 45% of the block rewards for providing high bandwidth, 24/7 connections, which pro-
vides basic requirements for further XSN features. Staking rewards, whether that be from TPoS or
regular PoS, will also receive 45% of the block rewards, for leaving their nodes online and securing the
network. Lastly, 10% of the block rewards will go to the treasury as an extra fund for future develop-
ments of XSN and various other factors. The breakdown is shown below in the Pie Chart.

LEDGER WALLET SUPPORT

StakeNet is one of the coins and tokens (to date) that are supported by the Ledger Blue and Nano S
hardware wallets. Ledger is the world’s leading cryptocurrency hardware provider, with the aim of
providing users with a simple, portable and highly secure solution for holding coins without the
added risk of storing them on easily compromisable devices such as smartphones and personal com-
puters. An existing integration means that users can purchase a Ledger wallet as a low cost solution
and store their private keys on it, and existing Ledger users already have a ready-made integration
(provided they upgrade to the latest version).

We believe this will accelerate the rate of adoption and increase consumer trust in the StakeNet
network, as security concerns are frequently cited as being barriers to use of cryptographic assets. The
integration also fits in perfectly with our Trustless Proof Of Stake solution as users no longer need to
disclose their private keys in order to stake and be eligible for Revolving Stake Bonuses (RSBs), which
we find to be in harmony with our long-term goals.

5. OUR VISION

Our goal for StakeNet is to create the world's first truly trustless, profit-driven economy with the use
of TPoS, the highest level of network security using decentralized cold staking, and Masternodes, the
highest level of providing network services in a truly decentralized world. We accomplished our main
goal within a month after launch date and we are now pushing boundaries to expand our ecosystem
of the XSN services and products. Our next big milestone for 2018 is to launch our StakeNet Decen-
tralized Exchange (DEX) and Cross Chain Proof of Stake(CCPoS) capabilities to broaden the ecosystem
and to make crypto assets more accessible and secure for the average user around the world.

6. OUR MISSION

StakeNet's mission is to make the XSN framework an ecosystem that allows easy and secure staking
via TPoS - the highest level of security using decentralized cold staking. We strive to invent new appli-
cations for TPoS and set up/partner with many different businesses to implement services such as
Multiwallets/Staking as a Service, Masternodes as a Service, Pooled Masternodes, and Atomic Swap
Services. The profits from these businesses will then be used to buy & burn XSN through monthly
RSBs.

9. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE OF XSN COIN

XSN coin is a state of the art cryptocurrency that allows a peer-to-peer
( method of payment and is deployed on its dedicated StakeNet block-
chain based technology. It will be used for daily transactional activities
happening within the XSN coin financial ecosystem, for staking and

masternode purposes, merchant services, and can also be used as a peer to peer exchange and store
of value between users securely, and efficiently at reduced costs.

By using XSN coin and its dedicated blockchain technology that is backed by innovative technologies
such as TPoS, Lightning and Stealth Mode, XSN Coin aims to enhance its services to consumers,
sellers, and merchants. This allows a level of transparency that was previously unrealized while creat-
ing incentives for users to adopt and use the platform.

10. KEY TECHNOLOGIES AND FEATURES

PoS REVOLUTIONIZED— INTRODUCING TRUSTLESS PROOF OF STAKE(TPoS)
BACKGROUND OF PROOF OF STAKE

At its very core, the modern banking system is based on a simple paradigm - ‘Trust’ We give our
money to banks and they provide us with services in return (deposits, loans, and investments). While
we could perform these services ourselves, it has proven much more convenient to use this central-
ized, trust-based system.

To mitigate the potential for abuse presented by such a global centralized system, decentralized
blockchain based assets, such as Bitcoin, have been introduced. To secure a decentralized network
and ensure users cannot double-spend their funds, Bitcoin utilizes a Proof-Of-Work (PoW) algorithm,
which requires miners to prove through distributed consensus - a large pool of people who are geo-
graphically segregated agreeing on transactions or blocks that are valid/invalid to be added/rejected
to the blockchain - have spent a certain amount of computational resources in order to make an
attack on the network uneconomical.

The computing power required to carry out the cryptographic calculations only ever increases as the
difficulty increases, thus consuming greater amounts of electricity. In the long run, this would be
counterproductive to the health of a cryptocurrency, as miners would have to sell substantial por-
tions of their coins for fiat currency to foot the electricity bill, devaluing the price of the cryptocurren-
cy. Thus, it can be deduced that PoW networks are not financially ideal as only miners can receive
block rewards and transaction fees in return for precious resources, whereas regular users do not see
any ROI from holding their coins.

This is where Proof of Stake (PoS) networks come in. Proof of Stake is a typical computer algorithm
through which a cryptocurrency achieves their distributed consensus. It is also a better alternative to
the PoW algorithm because it achieves the same distributed consensus at a lower cost and in a more
energy efficient way.

The transaction confirmation mechanism shifts from a burden of proof of the expenditure of resourc-

resources over to total stake held, where transactions are confirmed by simple nodes who hold large
balances, and the greater the balance the user holds, the more likely they are to receive fees and block
rewards. While this significantly reduces the number of resources required to confirm transactions
and effectively allows the average user to see positive ROI on balances held, this system still requires
a user to maintain connectivity at all times, have a high-bandwidth connection, and for their wallets
to be unlocked 24/7. During any time frame in which all or any of the aforementioned conditions are
not met, the user is skipped by the network and does not receive their fair share of stake rewards.

INTRODUCING TRUSTLESS PROOF OF STAKE (TPOS)

StakeNet has devised a solution to the problems being faced by users of decentralized networks
today: Trustless Proof of Stake (TPoS). TPoS essentially allows users to own a stake in StakeNet, a Proof
of Stake currency, and have any other node (merchant nodes) do the staking for them using their
high-bandwidth, continuous connectivity (to ensure maximal rewards distribution) while not having
to share any spendable balance or private keys with the node owner. Your funds are yours and yours
alone, and will safely and securely grow over time even while you sleep. This feature was created with
the intention of allowing users to securely stake XSN coins in cold storage from hardware devices.
Increasing security for both the network and the user. We believe TPoS will be the next stage of evolu-
tion in terms of guaranteeing ROI on balances, and our adoption strategy will ensure it becomes the
standard across financial services worldwide. TPoS allows any fund owner to delegate the duty of
growing their funds to any interest generating service provider (typically served via Masternodes on
the network) without having to lose control over their funds. Think of it as putting your money inside
of a virtual bank that cannot fail, get robbed, go bankrupt, become insolvent or shut down, with you
being able to withdraw or move 100% of your funds at any time, day or night, no questions asked and
no withdrawal limits imposed.

TPoS takes on the robust infrastructure introduced by Bitcoin, the Blockchain, and adds an extra layer
on top, called the delegation layer. With Bitcoin (and any other digital currency in existence) a user
would have to send their money to the said service provider in order to grow their funds, instead,
XSN's TPOS allows users to delegate their funds. With StakeNet you do not send over your money, you
send over the right to grow your money, temporarily, until you find someone who offers a better
service. This is the very essence of the free market.

FEATURES
1. StakeNet is fundamentally private: The StakeNet Network utilizes a technology called Stealth
Mode, meaning that a user can choose to send funds to a recipient without any traces. Sender and

recipient details are hidden and obfuscated, making it impossible to track your movements.

2. StakeNet provides attribution and is always on: Using a dedicated blockchain, StakeNet records

each user's balance and stores it forever, until they choose to move it around. The StakeNet Network
is cryptographically secure, meaning that no one can access anyone's funds unless they have their
private key (unique password) and is fully decentralized, meaning it is not owned by any party who
can choose to arbitrarily change the rules.

3. StakeNet is trustless: Unlike any other financial system or digital currency, StakeNet is the only
solution that allows users to delegate the right to grow their funds without needing to actually hand
over custody over them. This is groundbreaking technology and cannot be found anywhere else.

MECHANICS

To accomplish the above-mentioned features, XSN has created a multi-layered cryptographic archi-
tecture that expands the private-public key paradigm, called Triplet-Based Encryption. This three-lay-
ered model will feature a public key, which serves as a public address and stores unspent balances, a
private key, which can authorize the spending of a balance stored on the public address it was used
to create, and a "shared" key. The shared key is created whenever a user chooses to allow a merchant
node operator to stake their funds and its sole purpose is to authorize the staking of a user's balance.
It cannot spend or move the balance around; for those the private key is required. Now that a user has
a new key that can be used for remote staking only and the private key no longer needs to be
disclosed, the concept of trust is once again eliminated, allowing the economics of the StakeNet
network to prosper. We purposely made the barrier to entry easy to become a TPoS merchant, this will
ensure competition and enough decentralization amongst TPoS merchant nodes to prevent 1 mer-
chant from monopolizing the market. Our dev team also can develop 1-click setups for merchant Ul's
if need be to even further ensure decentralization to allow average non techies to enter the market.

TPOS CONTRACT

A XSN Trustless Proof of Stake (TPoS) contract is a special agreement made on our blockchain which
allows an owner of a given address (we call “owner”) the ability to give staking permission to a sepa-
rate address (we call "merchant"). The merchant does not have permission to move funds in the TPoS
address, only the right to stake the balance of that address. The owner can move his funds out of the
TPoS address at all times, giving him complete control of his funds during and throughout the execu-
tion of this contract.

Required information to create a TPoS contract

The contract is a special transaction with OP_RETURN that holds data specifying the terms. The con-
tract is created by a user sending 1 XSN to himself, which will also broadcast the terms of the contract
to the network. This 1 XSN needs to be made the lowest priority when the user spends XSN from his

Ledger wallet (if the 1 XSN is spent it will break the contract).

To cancel the TPoS contract the user simply needs to move all of his funds into a new address, or
cancel the contract via their Ul.

Required information in the contract is as follows:

1. TPOSADDRESS— Address owned by the creator of

11. TPOS—RESTORING TRUST IN CRYPTO BY
OFFERING PRIVACY

Trustless Proof of Stake allows people to offer Staking as a Business, where a merchant can stake other
people's coins and generate a commission based income from the rewards created, opening up new
opportunities for businesses to arise from our invention. A government's ability to tax and service
debt is the fuel that drives it. With cryptocurrencies coming, it is important to consider what effects
this will have on this matter. Full-time salaries are already being paid in cryptocurrencies, along with
the ability to anonymize these assets, disclosure will soon be at the complete discretion of the individ-
ual. This will, without a doubt, increase the difficulty to both track incomes and collect taxes, leaving
governments, small and large, facing difficult situations in both funding operations and collecting
revenue.

WHAT WILL BE THE EFFECT?

Politicians have already begun discussions about criminalizing those who ‘hide’ cryptocurrencies,
which will certainly evolve into broader criminalization of all holders at some point and time. Imagine
what the discussion would be like when the very salaries that pay the government politicians are in
jeopardy? It is highly likely that it would not be a discussion but a swift implementation of the law to
retain some semblance of control they once had. What does this mean for us? For most of us, we have
never had to worry about criminalization regarding personal IPs, web traffic, or general behavior with
our online cryptocurrency profile.

However, this activity may be used as evidence for conviction, and proof of guilt under possible prose-
cution in a not so distant future. “Hot” actions (i.e. any activity online related to cryptocurrency) will be
classified as a criminal offense entering this next era, and it will be of high value for users to remain
‘cold’ (interacting with the online ecosystem as little as possible), ensuring all privacy and security is
maintained. Our new feature - TPoS - was engineered with this in mind and will provide several
unique benefits that will ensure safety, privacy and security of our users not found anywhere else.
A cold storage exchange is made possible by our commission payouts, allowing an owner of a TPoS
address to instruct the protocol how to split rewards and also where to send them.

On the surface, the commission is simple, a merchant provides a service and charges a commission for
said services. However, in our case, this entire negotiation is handled directly on our blockchain. The
protocol itself is “smart” and knows how to split these newly minted TPoS coins. All done without
any human involvement through a series of cryptographically signed messages broadcasted when
the contract is first created. We engineered this feature to avoid predicting market rate or demand but
allow the two parties to settle among themselves a split from 1-99%. This will also allow alternative

forms of services to arise - such as willingly giving the merchant 100% rewards in exchange for certain
goods.

USE CASE

Say a merchant wants to gain a competitive edge and offer added services on top of their regular stak-
ing - they could instruct the owner to input 100% commission at the time of their TPoS creation, then
agree to send the reward in a currency of the owner's choice...to an address of their choice. The
owner could not only be staking his assets while offline but also be exchanging securely and safely,
without lifting a finger. The exchanged rewards could hypothetically be translated to any form: a BTC
address, ETC, or even fiat (directly into a bank account) and could be used as a means of “cashing in”
to an owner's local currency. Once these services are established it will drive large amounts of traffic
and attention to our currency, as we will be the first and only one with this unique functionality.
Couple this with increasing regulations and the effect will be even more dramatic.

SELLER RATINGS

Since the staking rewards would be in control of the merchant, this example of a hidden exchange
would have to maintain a small degree of trust. We believe this will be easily mitigated by giving the
merchant a ‘rating’ based on the quality of service. Any dishonesty or underperformance would
cost the merchant more in the long run than they would gain, similar to the effect of a standard seller
rating we are all familiar with before making an online purchase. This model works because the mer-
chant will never have the ability to make off with a significant amount of funds, and worst scenario is
he steals a few small rewards but completely ruins his reputation in doing so, and If the owner is not
comfortable with the service he can simply cancel the TPoS and redeem his funds at his discretion.

12. STAKENET MASTERNODES

Normally, launching a masternode is a highly technical process and generally goes way beyond the
scope of non-technical user’s abilities. StakeNet's Masternodes platform solves this issue by providing
a simple to implement masternode hosting service that allows users to launch a masternode with
incredible ease and no advanced technical ability required.

OVERVIEW

Masternodes or Bonded Validator Systems can simply be termed as the servers of a cryptocurrency. A
StakeNet masternode can be any computer that runs on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) and has the
StakeNet wallet with 15000 XSN as a collateral number of coins required to run the masternode.
Unlike normal nodes, that help the miner in generating new coins, StakeNet masternodes are utilized
for verifying transactions, voting system mechanism, etc. So in a way, the masternode serves the Stak-
eNet blockchain as well as other blockchains that will be integrated via cross-chain support. For users
who do not understand the complex mechanisms of cryptocurrency trading and still want to have a
passive cryptocurrency income, owning a masternode means that they are involved and making
gains even when not trading.

StakeNet masternodes are dedicated hardware nodes that reside on servers around the world to
ensure network decentralization and needed redundancy. Masternodes serve a critical role in adding
a self-governing, service-providing layer to the network, as well as, supporting the StakeNet vision
and mission statement by performing network-related functions. Trustless Proof of Stake essentially
allows users to own a stake in XSN, and have merchants do the staking for them using their
high-bandwidth continuous connectivity (to ensure maximal rewards distribution) while not having
to share any spendable balance or private keys with the merchant. Your funds are yours and yours
alone, and will safely and securely grow over time even while you sleep.

REWARDS PROGRAM
To secure the long-term health of the StakeNet Network, masternode operators will have financial
incentives to keep their nodes running for extended periods of time, primarily by getting paid for

services rendered. These will include the following:

1. A percentage of all block rewards, minus a fee paid directly to the treasury and subject to the
Block Equalizer rate of each period

2. Transaction fees, including usage of StakeNet's Flash TX services

GD

3. Revolving Stake Bonuses (RSB: expanded below in detail)

4. Trustless staking fees paid by entering into contracted partnerships with users who wish to
earn extra stake rewards by utilizing our unique Trustless Proof of Stake feature (TPoS; expanded
above in detail)

HOW XSN MASTERNODE WORKS?

Each masternodes will store an exact replica of the StakeNet blockchain, thus allowing average users
to use thin SPV web, phone, and PC/Mac wallets. Statistically speaking, the average user will tend to
want to use thin wallets for greater usability. We believe that in order to achieve the mass adoption we
have planned; a reduced barrier to entry will need to be introduced to our users. Masternodes help
eliminate the requirement for running a copy of the blockchain on a user's machine as wallets will
connect to masternodes directly and securely.

Masternodes will require a set amount of StakeNet coins as collateral, fully redeemable should the
owner ever wish to take their node offline. This is to reduce the financial viability of performing mali-
cious attacks on the network by setting up malicious nodes, as well as, guarantee that only stakehold-
ers in the StakeNet Network are allowed to vote on proposals, thus ensuring their quality.

The StakeNet project regards user anonymity and financial privacy as a core value. For a global pay-
ment network to be ready for mass adoption, payments between users must be confidential and
unlinkable, and public addresses used to store funds cannot reveal a user's balance. To illustrate this
point, failing to do so will result in vendors' inability to set prices and negotiate effectively as both
suppliers and customers will be able to see their transaction history, what they charge and what they
pay. This is clearly an undesirable outcome that we seek to prevent.

FLASH TX

In the interest of facilitating rapid transactions across the network, preventing any future scaling diffi-
culties, as well as providing a payment service that's ready for point-of-sale commercial use, StakeNet
will feature Flash TX—the ability to send near-instantaneous transactions between users. When using
Flash TX, the sender essentially requests the Masternode network to oversee the transaction being
made, which allows for several interim confirmations until the first blockchain confirmation occurs.
The receiver will immediately see the transaction as spendable in their wallet. This prevents dou-
ble-spend while increases the number of transactions per second the StakeNet network can handle.

13. REVOLVING STAKE BONUS (RSB)—DEFLATION
BASED REVENUE MODEL

As citizens of the globe, we are most likely familiar with a process called ‘inflation’— a common effect
of governments and their ability to print and increase the money supply. Although, its meaning may
get distorted through its use in politics, it is fairly simple to understand —every holder of the currency
at the time of this money creation (by choice or not) is transferring value from their personal holdings

at the time of this money creation (by choice or not) is transferring value from their personal holdings
to the destination these newly created monies ends up. It is a collective transfer of wealth and
extremely efficient form of taxation.

The opposite of inflation (deflation) can be just as powerful, simply working in reverse. It provides an
efficient method of transferring wealth from one singular point to all holders of the currency of that
particular time, a form of “reverse taxation”. Deflation is the method using which StakeNet rewards its
coin holders, executing this via the RSB mechanism. RSB “Revolving Stake Bonus” will build and sup-
port a network of businesses (i.e xsncoin.io) whose proceeds are sent to their respective and assigned
burner addresses. The scope of these operations will be limited to properly incentivize businesses to
perform the ‘proof of burn’

Unlike modern nation states, where governments are the sole executors of the national monetary
policies, XSN’s monetary policy is based on hard-coded rules and consensus via our master-
nodes—any decisions of how inflation is used is left to the ones with large stakes. No group of people,
whether elected or otherwise can unleash a tragedy of the commons. The possibilities that arise from
this proof of burn model are limitless, with the very highest ones being prioritized and pursued ona
strategic partnership and adoption level in the early stages. This is made possible due to XSN’s unique
economic model via our RSB coupled with treasury and API integration, creating a powerful multi-lay-
er of financial protection and growth for its holders. Over the next few years we will see boundaries
pushed on the disruption these self-governing communities have not just on their respective organi-
zations but greater society as a whole.

There, then, can be a suite of applications built on top of these addresses— analyzing in real time—
the health and statistics of the ecosystem. Holders will track exactly how much value these bonuses
provide directly from within our wallet and which organizations are providing them. There are many
models and layers you can build on this framework, let's start with a popular one—financial services.

RSB FUNCTIONALITIES
HEDGE FUNDS

It is important to understand the effects that blockchain will have on the world of traditional financial
services - especially in hedge funds. We are living in one of the most disruptive eras of growth in
human history, with massive amounts of wealth being generated in relatively short periods of time. A
hedge fund model is perfectly positioned to capitalize on hyper-growth industries, as they have
appropriate risk assessment and diversification models to benefit from these gains taking place.

Our treasury (~.001% of the total XSN market cap a month) controlled by our masternode holders
could, in theory, behave as an individual client of a chosen hedge fund. Through our budget/ proposal

system, fund managers would accept a principal from our masternode holders, and provide a trans-
parent portfolio with auditable gains and losses. Once their proposal is approved, we (the communi-
ty) assign them a burner address, which they use to send their agreed upon proceeds. There would be
little of an incentive for a fund manager to ‘run away’ with our budget since we work with reputable
names as RSB provides transparency and trust. For the fund manager, this will result in larger budget
approvals for that given individual or firm as time goes on.

There will also be reinventions of these funds along with all other financial service models. One is that
we could soon start to see ‘anonymous’ hedge funds, where the individual identities are concealed
but their brands are reputable, verifiable, and public. Just like an immutable blockchain being
released in the wild, we could see portfolios released getting popular whose origins are not traceable
but results famous.

STAKENET VENTURES

A common problem arising amongst treasuries is the oversight. It is difficult to find a model (outside
of delegating core team members themselves) that allows ongoing diligence after a budget is paid.
This causes inefficiencies, delays, and losses for investors. This current structure is also limited to
shorter terms (months vs. years) and is problematic for projects requiring long-term development
and growth.

AVC firm is a bit more dynamic vs a hedge fund as it deals with long-term business development,
equity distribution, and higher risk/ reward ratios. Focusing on development that services the StakeN-
et community, however, will strengthen our long-term position and growth coupled with more tradi-
tional treasury operations. Using equity distribution mechanisms on the blockchain, coupled with
smart contracts, ownership can be distributed accordingly to end users via the RSB burn, passing the
value to the average users.

STAKING AS A SERVICE

Staking services, pools, masternode hosting etc. will easily integrate with our RSB model and will be
the first to arise. Our proof of concept will be our very own xsncoin.io, whereby integration of our API
into the QT wallet, we will not only be able to provide information on the RSB address, but also statis-
tics relating to servers, nodes, and other relevant operations to users and investors directly, in real
time. Imagine having an interface where you can see data on each bonus address, showing you not
only the health and statistics of the given business but also the rewards it is providing to the holders
of the currency as well.

INCENTIVIZED PRIZES

Why is the free market so efficient? It is because individuals are racing to get a prize - profits. They will
put time, energy, and pain to get them. We can use this economic principle and put it on steroids
offering ‘X’ amount from our treasury to whoever solves a given problem, adds a feature, or builds a
service that helps our community. If the prize is big enough, there will be multiple teams competing
against each other, building entire businesses just to obtain the prize alone. We could track the pro-
gress of everyone from within our RSB interface, giving real-time data and statistics as they race
against each other to the finish.

14. XSN ATOMIC SWAPS

Atomic Swapping might be the closest thing to magic we have experienced thus far. It allows any user
on one blockchain to ‘swap’ their assets with a peer they have never met on a completely different
chain, and have that swap be 100% trustless, instant, and with little to no fee involved. It is also the
closest solution in protecting privacy while acquiring and trading assets. In order to use this service, it
requires assets to be “hot” and by nature, all information associated with these transactions are
required public in order for it to work properly. Although Atomic Swaps may not be considered
perfect when it comes to spotting identities, it is a step in the right direction as a peer to peer system
and is much more secure than a centralized point of exchange.

It is not difficult to spot identities in a P2P market, and with that being considered we figure a user
may not want to spend or transact any more than absolutely necessary on these platforms. As XSN
will have a compatible off chain network of its own, its features can be utilized to provide extra value
to this network. This is where our chain comes into play - by instantly ‘Atomic Swapping’ into a XSN
TPoS address, your newly swapped funds will automatically be safe offline and gain interest, without
the need to perform extra steps in sending, receiving, or activation of any kind. Rewards gained from
these addresses can also be exchanged into a different currency of your choice, if you use a privacy
currency (such as Monero) you will have in one step maintained a level of privacy, that up to this point
has required multiple steps, through multiple parties to accomplish.

15. XSN LIGHTNING NETWORK

One of the main objectives of introducing cryptocurrency was to make payment processing faster
and cheaper. However, as mining operations started to become expensive, transaction fees for Bitcoin
also started raising. A version of the technology that is meant to make cryptocurrency payments
faster and cheaper, called Lightning Network, is the second layer to enable off-chain transactions on
Bitcoin and is expected to be a game changer in the evolution of the crypto currency.

Once it is deployed across all nodes, the Network will
speed up transaction processing and decrease their
associated costs on Bitcoin’s blockchain. The Light-
ning Network allows Bitcoin users to open payment
channels between each other. The parties can then
conduct transactions without having to post them to
the Bitcoin blockchain, avoiding delays and costs that
result from recording those transactions each time.
Once the channel is closed, only the resulting balanc-
es are recorded on the blockchain, not the full trans-
action history of the channel, and only then are
Bitcoin fees paid. There is no required time or transac-
tion limit required to close a payment channel, so
they can potentially remain open for months of years

16. XSN TREASURY

As a fully Proof of Stake currency that lacks mining rewards, StakeNet maximizes block rewards and
fees for its staking users and masternode operators. The network can therefore, more comfortably
afford to allocate a certain share of all distributed fees and rewards to a central fund, known as the
treasury. The treasury is a cryptographically sealed public address that holds all funds allocated to it
by the network, whose funds can only be spent on proposals submitted to the network officially via a
dedicated portal. Each proposal can be voted upon democratically by masternode operators propor-
tionally to the stake they hold in the masternode network (i.e 2 masternodes will entitle the operator
to 2 votes). Once a proposal is approved, funds are allocated to it.

The treasury, and its democratic voting nature ensures that the network not only has a chance to

receive project proposals that help develop and propel it further, but that project contractors com-
pete against each other to deliver the highest quality projects on time and under budget.

17. XSN CROSS CHAIN PROOF OF STAKE (CCPOS)

BACKGROUND

The value of blockchain is its concept of immutability. This strength however brings real world com-
plexities difficult to manage in use cases, as blockchain was not conceived to adapt easily and faces
challenges working with rigid models limiting its agility. For a new breakthrough to be adopted, often

a coin must often change its “rules” and undergo what is called a “Hard Fork”.

In a large network this can be very damaging as it requires consensus amongst all nodes to run new
software, possibly fragmenting its community and sometimes changing its history. There is also noth-
ing to stop forks from occurring again and again at any point in the future, diluting a coin’s value and
market capitalization. There may be solutions however, using recently developed technologies and
advancements, in this article we will discuss a few. If we can achieve these goals, it would give teams
a better, smoother model to conduct operations.

Through this mechanism of CCPOS, StakeNet is creating programing protocols that themselves will
interact with the ‘rules’ on completely separate chains other than their own. This ability would allow
communities to utilize new technology, inventions, and advancements ensuring they are able to
adapt and adopt easily as well as remain competitive.

OVERVIEW

An atomic swap is essentially proof—a user is proving he has transferred funds from one account to
another and thus its contract terms are satisfied. A verification mechanism on the other end is observ-
ing making sure the first user does act honestly and is true to his promise. If all is good the contract is
allowed to execute, if not they are able to refute—cancelling the contract. Using this method, a user
could also move funds to himself—proving he owns a stake in the 1st chains currency. This proof
could be broadcasted on chain #2 (and verified using atomic swap functionalities) that our user does
indeed possess a stake in the 1st chain. The second chain’s protocol might then allow for an appropri-
ate response in light of this ‘proof of stake’ This could be in the form of unlocking privileges, rewards,
or access to special features. Ownership on the first chain could even be used as “fuel” for its sister
chains, creating a hierarchy while avoiding fragmentation.

This would increase the origins (1st chain’s) value greatly as any new advancements can be adopted
into the ecosystem, using the stability, infrastructure and community from the original chain. What

would result is an intra-network of blockchains we call “Inter Chain Clusters”.

INTER CHAIN CLUSTER

These Clusters have interdependent traits to one another, giving additional value to users within a
given network. They still would however be able to communicate, sync, and partake in all other
features allowed through those running on a lightning network. If the lightning network is analogous
to an “internet” allowing communication to different blockchains, this would be similar to a‘LAN’—a
group of local chains having special rules relative to one another, but also able to communicate to the
outside world.

Because lightning nodes are custom built to each chain, one could reprogram and construct rules
from scratch with specialized interdependence in mind. So long as the new chains have code to be
both lightning compatible as well as cluster compatible it will allow room for flexibility in all other
aspects of building and programming for experimentation and invention. This will allow new technol-
ogies to be quickly integrated as a framework will exist satisfying all pre requirements needed allow-
ing developers room to operate quickly and freely.

We should stress that this goes radically beyond the concept of |COs being run on the Ethereum chain
for example, as new projects wouldn't be restricted to being token-based solutions on the same
chain. Instead, they’d have their own chains, and subsequent chains for secondary purposes, with
virtually unlimited flexibility. As they'd be ‘tethered’ to our main chain—holders, masternode opera-
tors, and core team members will all benefit.

WHY HAS THIS NOT BEEN DONE?

One of the main limitations of atomic swaps is the user must have two blockchains— his own as well
as that which he intends to interact with in order to verify the terms of his contract are met. He needs
both so he can physically refute if terms are not met or allow it to execute if he sees nothing wrong.
This method causes limitations however as a human is needed for this entire process to function. In
order for cross chain proof of stake to be possible it requires complete autonomy on the part of the
protocol.

In our case utilizing masternode functionalities to both monitor, and verify will solve this issue. Allow-
ing masternodes to contain databases of 3rd party chains, (specifically our sister chains) while watch-
ing for and verifying specific actions allows us to autonomously cross chain communicate via the pro-
tocol. In addition to CCPOS this would also enable an ability for users to “light-swap” (atomic swap
without having to DL an entire 2nd blockchain) directly on our protocol, without the need of a 3rd
party centralized service.

Delegating CCPOS responsibilities to masternodes would also provide an added income stream as
new fees and rewards would exist associated with these cross chain verifications. If a sister chain
increases in popularity and demand, ROI on main chain masternodes would rise as proving your stake
on chain #1 would be the only way to unlock given actions on chain #2— & utilizing our masternodes
would be the only way to accomplish this proof.

MAINTAINING AGILITY
In a world of open source, it can be difficult to protect new innovations from being forked, spun, and

implemented in new and sometimes better models. As we diverge from traditional ownership (pat-
ents, copyrights etc.) we must learn to preserve value in this new environment. No better could this

be done through engineering protocols themselves to respond to original decentralized master
chains. The result would be not centralized control but a hierarchical control (HC) with masternode
owners from an origin chain determining the direction, development, and purpose of the given inter
chain cluster.

Platforms will soon rise eclipsing bitcoin, and ability for chains to adapt and evolve will be critical, as
those that cannot will fade, be replaced and forgotten. We will see chains begin to combine into
greater cohesive bodies where at its core lies a decentralized system growing proportionately with
breakthroughs and advancements in the greater field of cryptocurrency. Rather than combat disrup-
tion we will position ourselves to adopt disruption — our community will secure future value and
exposure to new trends simply by holding our asset, and our masternode owners will also benefit as
their added service in verifying these cross chain proof of stakes would increase fees, rewards, and
overall ROI giving us definitive value moving forward.

18. FUNCTIONALITIES

The technology we are implementing can be applied and disrupt a broad range of industries. TPoS
essentially allows differing degrees of access to a given asset. In our case the owner of XSN will be able
to allow 3rd parties to perform actions with their coins (staking) however they will be limited to this
designated action and nothing else. This could apply to everything from the sharing economy to gen-
eral security. If someone wants to rent an apartment, the owner can allow the customer access into
their front door but deny access to their bedroom door, allow access to drive a car but limit access to
open the hood and tinker with the engine etc.

STAKENET.IO - Online Staking, Hosting and Monitoring Platform

The StakeNet team is building a platform in which users would be able to keep their holdings safe,
stake their major PoS (proof of stake) coins, and trade coins via a decentralized exchange (DEX) all in
one single place. For existing solutions, in order to get staking rewards for your PoS coins, you need to
run the wallet(s) and keep it online 24/7 continuously which most users find it unpleasant. XSN solves
this problem by providing a secure environment to store your coins and stake them at the same time,
so you do not have to keep your computer running.

NORMALIZATION SHOCKWAVE

The StakeNet R&D team is currently reviewing a possible introduction of a "Normalization Shock-
wave". This shockwave will be a multiplier placed on all running proposals across the network to main-
tain their real value. For example, let's assume that a graphic redesign project for a new website for
StakeNet is being lead and has received funding for a total of 1,000 StakeNet coins. A week later, the
price of StakeNet increases by 25% (very common in the cryptocurrency world). The community will
vote on a shockwave multiplier of 0.8 in order to restore the project's real value to 1,000 StakeNet at
the moment of approval. This will also work the other way around; a multiplier above 1 will ensure
that if the price of StakeNet drops below its initial value the project isn't frozen and is brought to com-
pletion.

Mathematically speaking, since all multipliers preceding the most recent one are already factored
into the most recent one, there is no need to keep track of each individual iteration and engage in
complex calculations that could wrongfully inflate or deflate any project's funds. We believe in sim-
plicity of design.

BLOCK EQUALIZER

As Masternodes serve a vital role in the ongoing operation and development of the network, having
too few across the network negatively contributes to its health and resilience. On the other hand,
having too many can hinder future growth. As Masternodes require collateral, having an excessive
amount significantly restricts coin liquidity, which prevents commercial application and adoption
outlook. It also reduces the number of coin-staking users on the network.

It is therefore valuable to create a mechanism that strikes an ideal balance between the two. Block
Equalizer determines the current balance between the fees and rewards earned by Masternode oper-
ators and the stake rewards earned by users as a whole. If the balance is tilted in favor of one of the
sides, it reduces its rewards and increases the rewards earned by the other side. For example, if there
are too many Masternodes and too many rewards are earned by them, as a result, Block Equalizer will
reduce the Masternode share of the block rewards and increase the share users earn by the same
ratio, and vice versa. This will be dynamically and automatically recalculated every N blocks by the

blockchain.

20. XSN COMMUNITY BUILDING STRATEGIES

Some of the mediums we use for community building include but are not limited to:
WORD OF MOUTH MARKETING

It means when you are apprised by someone you trust directly. Having already been in the market for

years, we know that when users are staking or
holding XSN Coin, they are committed to the
cause. As it says that, there is no marketing better
than the word of mouth, we are at a huge advan-
tage because of our already developed network
and this will help us grow in the longer run.

beneficial for both the parties and helps in enhancing acceptability of the coin.

INTENSE DEEP CODING AND EDUCATING PEOPLE OF THE RISKS CONCERNED

Our highly experienced and professional team of developers have ensured that XSNCoin and XSN
Platform is here to stay for longer run. We not only take care of the development end in terms of bug
fixing but ensure that the promises made at our launching are kept.

ATTRACTING AND CONVINCING MERCHANTS

One of the most important aspects for a cryptocurrency is: marketing it so well that stakers and hold-
ers have a place to spend it. We know our target group and have the best strategies in place, to
convince even those who are not aware of the crypto. We already have made concrete steps in this
regard and our community driven services (Discussed earlier in detail) are inspired by this vision. We
aim to get the XSNCoin accepted as a payment solution in online shops to get their attention. We aim
to be bringing merchants the customers and increasing their sales while reducing their payment fees.
The rest is a matter of persistence and we make it as easy as possible to get them started.

Introduction

The position of cryptocurrency in today’s world is growing rapidly: the combined
market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies has increased more than threefold since
early 2016, reaching almost $150 billion in August 2017. According to the latest data,
the current number of unique active users of cryptocurrency wallets is estimated to
be about 6 million. Thus, the application of cryptocurrency becomes an important
ssue.

f cryptocurrency is designed to be a means of payment, then what can you buy
with it right now? There are precedents of people using bitcoins to buy real estate
and conduct other financial transactions, and each notable use of cryptocurrency

becomes an event in the cryptofield and brings society closer
to the widespread use of such currencies.

But can you actually buy something from another person using bitcoins or
“altcoins”?

Even though more and more outlets and merchants are beginning to accept
cryptocurrency as a means of payment, anyone in possession of a sum of bitcoins or
“altcoins” can still not use them in day-to-day financial operations.

The idea of creating a marketplace came to the project team after a crowdfunding
platform where small-scale productions and startups find crowdfunding for the
development of their projects and realization of their own ideas.

In the space of 5 years, Boomstarter has helped fund more than 1,500 projects
that have subsequently become full-fledged, profitable business ventures. That was
when we found out that small-scale productions with real potential have no viable
way of breaking into a global market. Through supervising and studying their work
from inside we realized what impedes them from participating

in global trade.

The main reasons for the failures by scaling:

e Lack of customer's confidence in an unknown seller who offers goods
of unconfirmed quality;

e Impossibility of providing the service at the level of an international company;

e Lack of multilingual twenty-four-hour customer support;

e Lack of skillful ‘package’ of goods and multilingual localization;
° Lack of international marketing knowledge.

“\«~_ for further development and product launch to the international
market.

Building a system of e-commerce business is quite a sophisticated problem. The
company has to spend a lot of resources on creating of a team and channels of
distribution. In addition, one should know how to promote a product in light of
trends and specificity of a particular market.

Issues

Although the e-commerce field is growing rapidly, getting started with selling your
goods and services online is a daunting task.

The business owner has to use his/her resources ineffectively: to spend time on the
online shop management and to conduct advertising campaigns without assistance.

What's worse, of small-scale producers getting into a global market requires consid-
erable investments at the early stage and further monthly expenses for the mainte-
nance of the online shop operations. Besides, the manufacture faces bureaucratic

difficulties and transaction fees when conducting international payments. Few small-
scale productions can meet that kind of financial demand and be ready to face the
risks related to international sales and entering the new markets.

Target audience

Typical small-scale producers usually turn out about 50 product items and work in
the local or regional market. The staff of such a company includes from two to ten
people. Each of them combines several responsibilities and functions inside the com-
pany. Customer support and marketing are often managed by the business owner
or one or two employees.

Small-scale producer issues

The main issues addressed by business owners when getting into the interna-
tional market are as follows:

e Lack of twenty-four-hour multilingual customer support.
Selling your goods internationally means being able to keep the buyer-seller feed-
back line open at all times in order to be able to assist customers in different time
zones — and the lack of live customer support makes communication much less
effective;
Lack of localization.

Small-scale producers are not able to present the translation of product descrip-
tions and features taking into consideration the specificity of various countries
which renders the launch to the international market impossible;

High fees at the existing platforms and various charges of payment systems.
The existing platforms withhold a considerable part of the cost, let alone payment
system and conversion charges, transaction fees and taxes;

Lack of customer’s confidence in an unknown seller.
The customer prefers verified sellers who offer goods of confirmed quality, while
the unknown sellers with no reputation have to compete with them;

Lack of proper “online sales pitch” for items.

Each purchase, especially the one made online, is based on many parameters. The
lack of the product description, parameters, good-quality photos, video overviews
and customer reviews negatively impact sales;

Impossibility of automatization.
In addition to the all of the above issues, the small-scale manufacture owner is not
ready technologically to make the online store completely automatic;

Competition with global corporations.

International corporations have a wide range of tools for marketing high-quality
goods across the globe at their disposal, which small-scale productions do not
have access to, making it impossible for them to go global;

Cash deficiency.
Businesses receive money from sales only after a certain delay, and increasing
sales without factoring this into the equation will sooner or later prove to be an
impossible task.
Online shop customer issues

On the other hand, the list of issues related to the buyer's experience with
small-scale producers is also quite long:

e Goods search.
A great deal of unique goods made by small-scale producers have no adequate
descriptions or photos, which hampers the search of the desired product. Be-
sides, many good-quality items of small-scale production cannot be ordered on-
line at all;

e Lack of proper “online sales pitch”.
Because of the lack of skillful presentation materials the customer cannot get a
full overview of a product and as a result declines the purchase;

e Lack of reliable reviews.
Without any way to confirm the authenticity of reviews posted on custom-made
sites of online stores, customers are unable to form a true-to-life impression
about the product;

° Lack of guarantees.
Many online stores offer goods on an upfront fee basis, but not all customers are
ready to risk sending money to an unfamiliar online shop which can turn out to be
a short-lived website.

leaders in expenditure are China, USA, Great Britain and Japan.

In view of the consumer demand in the e-commerce field, more and more small
and medium companies need the assistance of marketplaces for launching their
products to new markets and attracting new clients.

Still for the majority of small enterprises the barriers to entry are hardly superable
and the marketing budget expenses appear to be an unattainable luxury.
Marketplaces, in their turn, help solve this problem and offer a lot of benefits

both for sellers and for customers:

e Blanket fees of the platform and sale charges eat off a considerable part of the

sellers’ receipts;

e Expenses for the registration and establishment of the enterprise in the country
where the platform is located in. The expenses of this kind are typical for Chinese

marketplaces;

e Applying other formal procedures necessary for the start of trade;
e Additional fees of the payment systems which marketplace works with
(besides acquiring payment systems);

Why do we need the Blockchain?

& Cryptocurrency payment and smart contract implementation.

Purchase payment in Storiga is conducted directly and without any middleman in-
volved, in any convenient currency. The smart contract implementation and the use
of blockchain makes the transactions as safe and fast as possible.

The smart contract transfers the money to the seller's account only when the item
has reached its destination. So the customer pays only after receiving the product,
which increases his or her confidence in the service and makes online shopping
more attractive.

Openness and transparency maintenance:
e Transaction transparency ensured by the blockchain technology;

e Honest customer reviews — only customers who actually bought an item (with
a confirmed transaction) will be able to comment on their customer experience;

e Token holders will get an access to the open-source statistics with real-time publi-
cation of important metrics of business processes and the platform development
dynamics: purchases, the number of active stores and visitors, average receipt
amount etc. This is the simplest and the most open way to monitor the platform
development and forecast the increase of one’s bonuses due to STQ holding;

e Aplatform-wide blockchain-based CPA network that guarantees transaction trans-
parency across all open offers and no holds — any webmaster will be able to see
all purchases made through a referral link as recorded by the blockchain.

Security guarantee:

e Safe purchase system: any customer can get a refund for a low-quality item at
their sole discretion within 14 days* of purchase. This condition is included in
each smart contract, and the money for the purchase will be refunded in cryp-
tocurrency using the current exchange rate (through a cryptocurrency exchange
platform).

Small-scale manufactures may undergo significant structural changes in
consequence of growing amount of orders and margin. Higher workload of
the basic infrastructure will increase their profitability and allow to expand the
production and develop the company. They will also get a competitive advantage
in those regions where the sector they work in is developed poorly for some
reason or another.

Small-scale producers have a small staff (at the average from three to five people)

Storiga supplies all the services necessary for expansion, entirely supplanting
marketing, sales, communication, Support and IT departments. The price is by
orders of magnitude lower than the expenses the entrepreneur would incur
in case of independent full team building.

Placing the goods at the Storiqa platform and paying the annual fee
of 18000 STQ the seller obtains the capacity of an online shop whose
operating expenses amount to $468,000.

The main factor which impedes the majority of small-scale producers from
getting into the international market is a high financial entry barrier. It appears
due to the necessity of building additional teams inside the project, whose
responsibilities previously were often carried out by other employees (handling
of rare (due to small amount) conflicts or formation of lease contract for a
local billboard does not require the employment of additional staff). However,
with the company amendment the employees become overloaded and fail to
manage the increased amount of problems. At the same time the majority of

companies cannot afford fund raising aimed at project development, and this

problem stands in the way of business expansion.

Storiga allows companies to solve the issue of non-core activities related to
product promotion and to concentrate on the main goal, i.e. efficient increase

of production volume and expenditure reduction due to the growing amount.
@® 8+ efficient and ready-to-use tools for successful sales, analysis, and customer
feedback:

e Advanced Customer Analysis Tools
Storiqa offers the mechanisms to constantly gather, analyze, and process
customer data. The key metrics will allow sellers to promptly adapt to any
changes in demand, since Storiga makes tracking customers and adjusting
your current business model a simple and elegant experience.

e Customer Feedback That Works

Storiga offers a set of tools for effective buyer-seller communication. The
main reason of refusing a purchase is the necessity to see/touch the product
or, in other words, learn more about its features. Today's customer wants to
learn all the ins and outs of their purchase from the manufacturer directly,
get involved in creating the unique product tailored to their wants and needs,
and receive up-to-date information about any campaigns and offers straight
from the source. Additionally, 30% of all customers prefer to place orders
and ask any questions about their future purchase by phone. The integrated
telephony allows to receive feedback calls from clients in two clicks, saving
and playback of recorded calls, and monitoring of the performance of their
call managers. Storiga’s customer support tools make it possible to get your
customer feedback lines up and running, and increase sales through direct
interaction with your clients.

e Integrated Marketing Tools

We help our clients attract new customers for increased sales growth
through easy-to-use integration with the largest partner networks, as well as
by offering a wide variety of tools to track customer experience in order to
make each and every store more client-oriented. Furthermore, Storiga is pre-
configured to work with many popular advertising platforms. Advertising and
promotional expenses are automatically aggregated by our platform, which
makes Storiga incredibly useful for entrepreneurs.
© Comprehensive support from the Storiqa team
Business owners can always get in touch with the platform developers using our
24/7 support service, while any customer-related issues can and will be resolved
with the help of Storiga arbitration.

@ Items can be sold for cryptocurrency or any fiat currency alike
Sellers receive payment in the currency of their choosing, including cryptocur-
rency.

@ Storiqa Community Services
Storiga is a community of helpful people! You can get in touch with the commu-
nity to request description (with translations), photos and video and text reviews
for the items you sell, using the platform's tokens as a reward. Crowdsourcing
is the foundation of the Storiqa community - our flexible system will let sellers
choose the exact combination of community services or a full community pack-
age for their store. In addition, requesting presentation content for your items
will mark them as verified, showing your customers that everything you sell was

tested and approved by the likes of them.

© Affiliate Marketing: Referral offers for reviewers

n addition, we also add an option to earn rewards through spotlighting an item:
bloggers, reviewers and other people with an audience can review goods sold
through Storiga and earn tokens through referral links for each item bought.
According to an inPowered sponsored Nielsen research, more often than not
readers put their trust in reviews, test drives, reviewer articles and opinions of
those who already owned and tried the item they want to buy.

The research poll showed that:

* 85% customers decide on a purchase after studying “live” reviews;

° 67% are more likely to buy an item recommended by an expert in the field;

e 69% put their trust into detailed reviews.

These figures are more or less accurate for all online sale categories, from beau-
ty products to phones and consumer electronics. And another important note

to take from this analysis: customers see reviews published on third-party sites
as more trustworthy than in-store posted reviews.
On the one hand, quality reviews for all items in stores help small-scale pro-
ducers increase their online sales and earn the trust of their customers; on the
other hand, there's a great number of video reviewers looking for affiliate offers
to develop their channels and boost viewership (since only 3 reviewers out of
100 enjoy marketing revenues of any kind and as much as 50% of viewership
traffic). Storiga brings sellers and reviewers together. Reviewers can choose any
item available through Storiga and receive it for free in return for a review - in
this way, things you sell will be deeply integrated into the reviewer's content and
way of presentation, increasing your revenue tenfold compared to conventional
advertising!

© Guaranteed influx of loyal customers
Offering your goods for purchase using cryptocurrencies and STQ tokens will
make your store accessible to a large audience of cryptocurrency holders; and,
since cryptocurrencies and tokens are somewhat limited in their use, there
will be a guaranteed customer base that will seek to exchange them for goods
through Storiga.

@ Factoring data using platform-wide store rating
Storiga will form a platform-wide store rating based on a number of factors, such
as delivery speed, quality of items and customer reviews. We will be able to use
this rating to supply our clients with the factoring data that will help them elimi-
nate cash deficiency as a problem.

@ Loyalty program builder based on the proper CPA network
We offer sellers a tool for creating loyalty programs by selling their goods at a
discount or giving them to the community via CPA networks, for example for
a review or a video overview. The platform will also provide the presence of
world-famous bloggers whom the Storiga participants can send product promo-
tions offers to, and the promoted product sales interest.

@ Free test of the platform effectiveness
We offer our clients a 60-day free trial. In this period the company can carry out
test placements of its products and ascertain the efficiency of the syste.

Why do buyers need Storigqa?

@ Buying what you need from anywhere in the world
Our platform will host millions of unique, tailor-made items created by small-
scale manufacturers that you will not be able to buy in any large-scale online
store.
@ Any item can be bought for cryptocurrency or STQ tokens with minimal fees, while
real-world currencies still remain relevant and valid.

© Increased cashback when paying with STQ tokens, as well as discounts for pur-
chases made with the tokens.

® Convenient and simple search for the goods you need
Storiga offers an extensive catalog of items sold in stores across the platform
with fine-tuned filters and categories, making finding the things you want to buy
a simple experience.

© Guaranteed quality
Storiga isn’t just another catchy name: the last two letters, QA, stand for Quality
Assurance, and we mean it. We assume the responsibility of ensuring high qual-
ity service, and guarantee that the seller will send the buyer the exact item as
described and outlined in the product description.

@® Protecting customer interests and Storiqa arbitration
We guarantee the high quality of items offered through Storiga. If an item is
damaged during shipping, the buyer can request arbitration through Storiqa
and request a full or partial refund (using the current exchange rate for crypto-
currency-paid orders) after a review. If the refunded order was paid with STQ to-
kens, you will be refunded the exact amount of tokens regardless of the current
exchange rate.

@ Safe and secure smart contract deals
When a transaction has been made, the seller can be sure that the buyer will
receive their item(s) when and only when the it arrives at the destination. At the
very moment that the seller sends the package, the buyer receives a tracking
code, which will allow them to track their order real-time. The smart contract en-
sures that the money goes to the seller's account only after the item has reached
its destination. Failing that, the buyer will be eligible for a refund within 14 days*.

@ Honest reviews
The smart contract records the interaction between the buyer and the seller,
ensuring all reviews come from people who actually bought the item.

* — or depending on local laws.
Platform Operation Principles

After the project launch store owners and buyers will get access to the basic func-

tions. The seller will be able to offer their items through the general catalogue divid-
ing them into relevant categories as well as create an autonomous online shop.

The seller can customize a discount system (by percent or value). Once the manda-

tory fields on the main page (the store name, brief and full descriptions, warranty
liabilities, delivery options and return policy, a logo, and a cover) and the catalogue

(items with descriptions, prices, and covers) are completed, your store will be availa-

ble for the first orders.

Storiqa rates for sellers

Storiga offers three rate plans and each of the three grants particular advantages
while using the platform. After the project launch all the stores will be working at the
Basic rate (1 STQ per 1 item per 24h). This rate plan includes all the basic functions
of the marketplace: an online shop with a catalogue, hosting, discount system and
24/7 customer support. In future we are planning to offer E-commerce (2 STQ per 1
item per 24h) and Premium (3 STQ per 1 item per 24h) rate plans. The E-commerce

25
rate plan will grant access to online card payments while purchasing the Premium
rate plan will give the seller convenient communication tools (Voice over IP, chat,
callback function and mailout), promotion instruments (enabling advertizing goods),
offering items through the Storiqa catalogue (it has color, size and price filters which
make the search convenient and efficient). The funds spent by the seller during the
previous period are calculated on the 1st day of the next month and the said sum in
STQ is charged off the seller's account. Ifthere are not enough tokens on the account,
they are automatically purchased through the integrated exchange customization
program by charging a corresponding sum of money from a bank card.

Storiqa Prospects.

In compliance with the current e-commerce development trends, payments on
Storiga will be made through smart-contract deals, which will result in the safest
transactions (the seller receives the money only after the item is delivered to its final
destination). We will introduce mobile apps for Android and iOS for quick and easy
shopping, a multi-currency wallet with the option to pay with cryptocurrency which
will make it unnecessary to follow the fiat money rate. It will be possible to make a
one-click purchase from any part of the world without any middleman involved.

STQ tokens

STQ tokens are issued for internal and external payments of the Storiga system
and also are the only payment instrument when you need to pay fees or pay for
marketplace services. STQ token are deeply integrated into the system to ensure
maximum trade flow — as the number of agents using the system grows, the value
of any cryptocurrency usually increases.

Use of STQ tokens

Goods placement fee.

Every month of items hosted in the marketplace shall be paid for with STQ tokens by
each store. At the moment of the project launch the fee is going to be 10 times lower
than placement offered by our competitors and will always remain low because the
nominal fee size will decrease with the increase in the STQ tokens rate.

However, a user does not have to have any tokens or be an expert on cryptocur-
rency exchange — they can pay the fee using their bank card or a payment service,
and the platform will automatically buy tokens with this money and will pay the fee.
The absolute purchase of STQ tokens every time a customer uses the platform is ex-
tremely important, because it ensures quotes liquidity for STQ First Purchasers and
permanent demand for tokens on the part of stores, which is the basic principle of
the increase in token quotes.

There will also be demand on the part of buyers as numerous stores will offer a big-
ger cash back and special prices to their clients that pay for goods with STQ tokens.

However, this system won't show considerable surplus as the buyers will be ex-
pectedly using earned STQ tokens in fiat money transactions with their contractors.
Therefore, this method will raise the liquidity for STQ First Purchasers but the influ-
ence on the market rate will be insignificant.

Promotion services.

Storiga will offer online shops a wide range of services (prioritizing in search results,
rating systems and appearance on the main page) allowing to attract more buyers.
All these services can be paid for with STQ tokens.

27
Referral programs and rewards.
The platform members will be able to add

itionally earn STQ tokens by taking part in

referral programs and getting awards for CPA offers.

Internal transactions of the members.

th tokens, the buyer can count on a big-

ger cash back and better offers. It’s important to mention that all the transactions

Transmission of the project development
to the STQ token rate

The need to pay fees and additional bonuses to those paying with tokens
grants the demand for tokens, which, on one hand, gives STQ First Purchasers
an opportunity to leave the project and at the same time has positive influence on
market quotes, as the only sellers of the STQ tokens will be the STQ First Purchasers.

1] |

Commission demand of stores.

Supply of tokens is possible only on the part
of the STQ First Purchasers

|!

The value of STQ tokens, like any other currency, will be determined by people's
willingness to accept them as the payment for their goods and services. Exchange
liquidity will allow STQ to develop on external websites. In addition to this, partner
projects will be able to pay with STQ tokens, making their transactions faster and
more transparent and also succeeding in marketing and promotion because the
system is popular and trendy.

Therefore, the token rate is correlated with the Storiqa platform mon-

@) ey turnover, its developments as a project on the system level. The
more sellers and buyers, deals and activity on the platform, the more
profit is gained by all the members. The placement fee is charged in
tokens, which the sellers have to buy, either themselves or indirectly
through STQ First Purchasers on exchange market. All this results in
the increase in the STQ token circulation.

It should be mentioned that the prices of the platform are adaptive — if the
token value rises, the size of the fee for hosting goods and services of promot-
ing a store within the platform decreases in face value of the STQ token and is
calculated according to the current token rate.

The platform will not buy or sell tokens on day-to-day basis, leaving this activity to
users. The platform fund will be permanently growing through collecting fees, but
these tokens shall not be sold in the exchange market. Their future purpose will be
determined upon analyzing the project development during its first years. In the

29
event of favorable business activity the said tokens can be used to finance the fur-
ther development of the system.

Cryptocurrency exchange listing

Upon finishing the Token Sale campaign the tokens can be easily bought or sold on
numerous cryptocurrency exchange markets. The number of exchange markets will
grow with the increase in the platform trade turnover and the users’ demand from
different countries.

There it will be possible to exchange STQ tokens for any of fluid cryptocurrency (BTC,
ETH).

Token Sale

Token Sale First Price $0.003

Total Supply no more than Hard Cap

Token Sale has two main goals:

e Adoption of STQ token;

e Raising funds for developing and promoting the Storiga platform.

The distribution will be carried out through a smart contract. Raised funds will be used

to launch the platform, integrate the token and finance promotion and marketing.

Depending on the raised sum, we can execute our project on different levels. 30
Soft Cap — $5 000 000
Hard Cap — $25 000 000

The Token Sale run ends when the Hard Cap threshold is reached.

15% of emission is reserved for the team and partners, a share will be 3% each
and will be unlocked as the project reaches the following token capitalization levels:
Token Sale campaign end, $100M, $250M, $500M, $1000M. The process will be
Escrow-controlled. As a result, it brings the STQ value interests of Token holders and
the team together.

period for launch on the Asian market, and the second one — after another 9-
months period to get introduced to the North American market);

M 15% — team;

™ 3% — to bounty rewards;

M 2% — to advisory board;

™ 60% — The main part of the tokens is distributed through the Token Sale.

After the Token Sale run all the further centralized token distributions will be carried
out at the expense of the fund which is replenished with fee payments. The price

31
will be determined according to the market quotes. Also, it will be taken into account
that additional sale creates oversupply and therefore the risk of the decrease in
market quotes. The distribution method must completely mitigate this risk in order
to protect the rights of the STQ First Purchasers (for example, through distributing
the tokens over a longer period of time).

Become a Campaign Member

To become a member of our STQ First Purchasers, you will need to purchase STQ
tokens by making an ETH transaction to our smart contract address. We accept ETH
transactions made from wallets ONLY. Please note that you should NOT make the
transaction using ERC20-incompatible wallets or cryptocurrency exchange accounts,
as that may potentially lead to you losing control over the tokens you would otherwise
have gained.

Sports and esports investment
mostly comes from media
corporations, corporate sponsors
and independent, wealthy financiers.
As such, the average fan has no
ability to participate in decision-
making events for the organizations
they follow, though this demand

exists. Chiliz fueled platofrms

- specifically a Chiliz-powered,
tokenized fan voting platform

such as Socios.com - fills this gap.
This affords fans some degree of
decision making influence, while
offering a new direct revenue stream
for sports and esports organizations.

Express Disclaimer:

The Socios.com Platform as well as the Fan Tokens fall outside the scope of this
White Paper - they are mentioned in this White Paper by way of reference only
and are strictly not regulated by the contents hereof.

Risk Factors:

The following is a non-exhaustive disclosure of principal risk factors which

are considered to be material by the Company in connection with the Private
Placement Event, and the acquisition, holding and/or use of Chiliz as well, to the
extent rendered application, the use of the Socios.com Platform at any moment

in time. Participants should consider these risk factors alongside all other
information provided in the White Paper and are advised to consult with their own
professional advisers (including their financial, accounting, legal, tax, technical

or other advisers and experts) before deciding to obtain Chiliz. In addition,
Participants should be aware that the risks described herein may combine and
thus intensify one another.

The Company believes that the following risk factors may even affect its own
business, as well as the external valuation of Chiliz (which external valuation is
beyond the scope and purpose of the reason behind the Socios.com Platform and
the Company's Business). Most of these risk factors are contingencies which may
or may not occur and the Company is not in a position to predict the likelihood of
such contingency occurring.

By acquiring, holding and using Chiliz, the Participant expressly acknowledges
and assumes the following risks:

General Suitability of token acquisition

The acquisition of Chiliz from the Company is only suitable for financially
sophisticated persons who are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of

O1 Considerations 8

such an acquisition, or other persons who have been professionally advised with
regard to token acquisition and who have sufficient financial resources to be able
to bear any losses that may arise therefrom (which may be equal to the whole
amount spent in connection with the token acquisition). Such an acquisition
should not be seen as an investment or a financial asset.

Risk of losing access to Chiliz due to loss of Private key/s, Custodial Error or
Participant Error

A Wallet is necessary to acquire, hold and dispose of Chiliz. The Participant
hereby understands that he is responsible for setting up the Wallet with a third-
party provider to hold Chiliz and he is responsible for implementing reasonable
measures for securing the Wallet. Accordingly, loss of requisite private key/s
associated with the Wallet holding Chiliz will result in loss of such Chiliz and
any other cryptocurrencies and/or tokens held within. Moreover, any third party
that gains access to such private key/s, including by gaining access to login
credentials of the Wallet that the Participant uses, may be able to misappropriate
the Participant’s Chiliz. Any errors or malfunctions caused by or otherwise
related to the Wallet that the Participant chooses to receive and hold Chiliz
including the Participant's own failure to properly maintain or use such wallet or
caused as a result of the choice of third party provider for the Wallet, may also
result in the loss of Chiliz Additionally, the Participant's failure to follow precisely
the procedures set forth in the Terms for acquiring and receiving Chiliz including
but not limited to, the provision of the wrong Wallet address for receiving Chiliz
may also result in the loss of his Chiliz.

Risk of Mining Attacks

As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens based on the Ethereum
protocol, (ERC20 tokens) Chiliz are susceptible to attacks by miners in the
course of validating Chiliz transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, including,
but not limited, to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, and
selfish-mining attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Socios.
com Platform and/or Chiliz, including but not limited to, accurate execution and
recording of transactions involving Chiliz.
Risks

Risk of Hacking and Security weakness

Hackers or other groups or organisations may attempt to interfere with Chiliz
in a number of ways, including, but not limited to denial of service attacks,
Sybil attacks, spoofing, smurfing, malware attacks, or consensus-based
attacks, and any such similar events which could have an impact on Chiliz, the
Socios.com Platform and the Services the Company may offer from time to
time.

Risk of Security weakness in the Smart Contract, Website and Chiliz Source
Code or any associates software and/or Infrastructure

There is a risk that the Smart Contract, Website, the Socios.com Platform

and Chiliz may unintentionally include weaknesses or bugs in the source code
interfering with the use of or causing the loss of Chiliz; the source code of the
Website is open and could be updated, amended, altered or modified from
time to time.

The Company is unable to foresee or guarantee the precise result of an
update, amendment, alteration or modification. As a result, any update,
amendment, alteration or modification could lead to an unexpected or
unintended outcome that adversely affects Chiliz and/or the Website. As a
result, Chiliz may be lost.

Risk of no Listing or low/no Liquidity

Chiliz are intended to be used solely for the Socios.com Platform and the
Company will not support or otherwise facilitate any secondary trading on an
exchange or the secondary market or the external valuation of Chiliz, which are
all beyond the scope and purpose of the Socios.com Platform. This restricts
the contemplated intended use of Chiliz only to the Socios.com Platform and
could therefore create illiquidity risk with respect to Chiliz that the Participant
owns. Even though there are currently online services available which enable
exchange of cryptographic tokens with other such tokens or even enable

the exchange of cryptographic tokens for fiat money, there are no warranties
and/or guarantees that Chiliz will be made available for exchange with

other cryptographic tokens and/or fiat money, and no guarantees are given
whatsoever with regard to the capacity and/or volume of such exchange/s.

O1 Considerations 9

It shall be explicitly cautioned that such exchange, if any, might be subject to
poorly-understood regulatory oversight, and the Company does not give any
warranties in regard to any exchange services providers. Users including the
Participant, if applicable, might be exposed to fraud and failure affecting those
exchanges. In any case, it is not the Company’s aim to enable exchange of
Chiliz for other cryptographic tokens or for fiat currency and it shall therefore
not commit to any endeavours to list Chiliz on such exchanges or any
secondary markets.

Risks of an eventual unfavourable fluctuation of ETH or Chiliz’ value

The Socios.com Platform is intended to be financially self-sufficient and self-
financing after the Private Placement Event and the Company commits to
have no specific interest in the market value of Chiliz. Nevertheless, if the
value of BTC, ETH and/or Chiliz fluctuates, the Company may not be able to
fund development to the extent necessary, or may not be able to develop or
maintain the Socios.com Platform in the manner that it intended. In addition
to the usual market forces, there are several potential events which could
exacerbate the risk of unfavourable fluctuation in the value of ETH or Chiliz
including another DAO-like attack on the Ethereum network, or significant
security incidents or market irregularities at one or more of the major
cryptocurrency exchanges.

Risk of Malfunction in the Ethereum Network or any other Blockchain and of
Competing Platforms

It is possible that Chiliz are interacting with malfunctions in an unfavourable
way, including but not limited to one that results in the loss of Chiliz or prevent
their use on the Socios.com Platform. It is possible that alternative platforms
could be established that utilise the same open source code and protocol
underlying the Socios.com Platform and attempt to facilitate services that are
materially similar to the Socios.com Platform. The Socios.com Platform may
compete with these alternatives, which could negatively impact and Socios.
com Platform, including the utility of Chiliz for use of the Socios.com Platform
Risks

Risk of Uninsured Losses

Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions, Chiliz
are uninsured unless the Participant specifically obtains private insurance to
insure them. Thus, in the event of loss of Chiliz or loss of Chiliz’s value, there
is no public insurer, such as the Investor Compensation Scheme or private
insurance arranged by the Company to offer recourse to the Participant.

Risk associated with uncertain Regulations and enforcement actions

The regulatory status of tokens in general, Initial Token or Coin Offerings,
Private Placement Event and distributed ledger technology is unclear or
unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether
regulatory authorities may apply existing regulation with respect to such
technology and its applications, including the Socios.com Platform and
the Chiliz. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether legislatures or
regulatory agencies may implement regulatory actions or changes to law
and regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications,
including the Socios.com Platform and the tokens.

Regulatory actions or changes to law and regulation could negatively impact
Chiliz and the Socios.com Platform in various ways, including, but not limited
to, a determination that the acquisition, holding and use or disposal and
transfer of Chiliz constitutes a regulated instrument that require registration
or licensing of those instruments or some or all of the parties involved in the
acquisition, contribution, sale and delivery thereof. The Company may cease
operations or interrupt the Private Placement Event in a jurisdiction in the
event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to
operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable or no longer viable to
obtain the necessary regulatory approval/s to operate in such jurisdiction or to
provide the Socios.com Platform.

Risk arising from Taxation

The tax characterization of Chiliz is uncertain. The Participant must seek

his own tax advice in connection with purchasing Chiliz, which may result in
adverse tax consequences to him, including withholding taxes, income taxes
and tax reporting requirements.

O1 Considerations 10

Risk of insufficient interest in Chiliz and the Socios.com Platform

It is possible that Chiliz and the Socios.com Platform will no longer be used by
a large number of individuals, companies and other entities or that there will
be limited interest in the use of Chiliz and the Socios.com Platform. Such a
lack of use or interest could negatively impact the development of the Socios.
com Platform and therefore the potential utility of Chiliz.

Internet Transmission Risks

There are risks associated with using Chiliz including, but not limited to, the
failure of hardware, software, and Internet connections, or other technologies
on which the Socios.com Platform or the use of Chiliz relies. Such failures
may result in disruptions in communication, errors, distortions or delays when
using Chiliz and the Socios.com Platform or the Website.

Risk of Dissolution of the Company

It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited
to, a decrease in Chiliz’s utility, the failure of commercial relationships, or
intellectual property ownership challenges, unfavourable market conditions
and added compliance and regulatory obligations, the use of the Socios.com
Platform may no longer be viable to be offered or the Company may need to
cease trading and be dissolved and liquidated.

Risk arising from Lack of Governance Rights

Since Chiliz do not represent or confer any ownership right or stake, share or
security or equivalent rights, intellectual property rights or any other form of
participation relating to the Company, all decisions involving the Company
will be made by Company at their sole discretion, including, but not limited
to, decisions to transfer more Chiliz for use, to sell or liquidate the Company.
These decisions could adversely affect the utility of that the Participant holds.
Regulatory Risks and Market Risks

The Company and by operation of the Socios.com Platform, are subject
to a variety of domestic and/or EU and international laws, regulation and
directives, including those with respect to privacy and data protection,
consumer protection, data security, and others. These laws, regulations and
41.1 directives, and the interpretation or application of these laws, regulations
and directives, could change. In addition, new laws, regulations or directives
affecting the Company, the Socios.com Platform and Chiliz could be enacted,
which could impact the utility of Chiliz and their use on the Socios.com
. Platform. Additionally, the Participants are subject to industry specific laws
Risks and regulations or licensing requirements.

If any of the Parties fails to comply with any of these licensing requirements
or other applicable laws or regulations, or if such laws and regulations or
licensing requirements become more stringent or are otherwise expanded,

it could adversely impact Chiliz and the Socios.com Platform, including the
Chiliz’ utility on the Socios.com Platform The Participant hereby accepts the
risk that in some countries Chiliz might be considered, now or in the future, a
Security Token. In this case the Company gives no representations, warranties
or guarantees that the Utility Tokens are not considered to be Security Tokens
in all countries. The Participant hereby accepts to be solely responsible of

the legal, financial and any other risks connected to Chiliz as a security in his
country and to be the only responsible to check if the holding, using and the
disposal of Chiliz is legal in your country.

Also, changes in laws, regulations and directives governing the Company's
operations may adversely affect their business and consequently the Socios.
com Platform. Any change in the Company's tax status, or in taxation
legislation in Malta or elsewhere, could affect the value of its financial
holdings, its business and the Company's ability to achieve its business
objective and continual commitment to the development of the Socios.com
Platform.

Other Inherent Risks

The Participant understands and accepts the inherent risks associated with
Chiliz, to the extent not covered elsewhere in the Terms, including, but not
limited to, risks associated with (a) money laundering; (b) fraud; (c) exploitation
for illegal purposes; and (d) any other unanticipated risks.

O1 Considerations 11

Unanticipated Risks

Cryptographic tokens such as Chiliz as well as blockchain are a new and
untested technology. In addition to the risks included in the Chiliz Documents
there are other risks associated with the Participant's acquisition, holding

and use of Chiliz , including some that the Company cannot or may not
anticipate. Such risks may further materialise as unanticipated variations or
combinations of the risks discussed in the Chiliz Documents.

The Participant hereby represents and warrants that he will take sole
responsibility for any restrictions and risks associated with the holding or use

of Chiliz. If any of the risks, mentioned in the Terms are unacceptable or the
Participant is not in the position to understand, the Participant should not acquire,
hold or use Chiliz.

THE CHILIZ

2.1 What is the Chiliz & the
Socios.com platform?

2.2 Why develop the Chiliz & the
Socios.com platform?

Socios.com,
the platform
Chiliz powers

Chiliz, powering Socios.com, gives sports and esports
fans the ability to crowd-manage their favorite teams,
games, leagues and events. By 2020, we anticipate

a sports & esports landscape that is not only shaped

by what games, teams and leagues draw the highest
audiences, but by those who can most effectively activate
and monetise that audience by putting their fan-base in
the driving seat. It’s called radical fan engagement:

A universal sports and esports ‘crowd-control’ engine
capable of giving fans voting rights to guide their some
of their favourite teams’ management and strategy
decisions. Any league, any team and any game, realised
with blockchain technology. With Chiliz powering the
Socios.com platform, fans can become influencers of
any competitive entity. In turn, teams, leagues & events,
from any corner of the sports & esports world can then
monetise the fan demand for these voting rights.

O02 The Chiliz ecosystem

Why develop
Chiliz& the
Socios.com
platform?

Our motivation: To turn the world’s billions of sports, esports
and gaming fans from spectators into influencers.

With Chiliz tokens powering the Socios.com platform our vision
is to turn 2.2+ billion gamers and 380+ million esports fans,
as well as the billions-strong community of football fans, from

spectators into team-connected influencers and decision makers.

The global sports market continues to grow year over year, and
the esports market in specific is expected to experience 32%
annual growth over the next 2-3 years.

Exploration to try to improve fan engagement in both sports and
esports is ongoing, as with both verticals, monetising fans via
direct team connection - outside of game broadcasts and live
events - continues to represent challenges.

Our vision embraces both cryptocurrency and blockchain backed
fan platforms as the most effective tools to empower sports’

and esports’ active fans and transform them from passive
spectators into active influencers, who help guide the teams and
organizations they love to follow.

PROBLEM & SOLUTION

3.1. The Opportunity

3.2 The Innovation

The Opportunity

Fans can only watch. They can’t make decisions or influence the
organizations they love

The current sports and esports environment offers - for the
most part - only transactional ‘contact’ for fans. They pay for
licensed products & watch their favourite line-ups compete in their
favourite games. However, this is a passive endeavour as the fans
have no influence over their favourite teams or players. While the
appetite to ‘activate’ fans as influencers exists, current exploration
into direct fan engagement, for example the ‘Fan Voice’ element of
F1 or the digital FanBoost engagement of Formula E, has not left
the realm of novelty.

Historically this has meant that unless you create your own team,
there are almost no systems in place for influencing team decisions
and there is no way to transition from fan to active participant.
Gaining this voice through direct investment in a specific team

is not an option for the vast majority of sports organisations. And
even if it were, the barriers to entry for an average sports fan - time,
funding, talent acquisition ability - are immense to the point of
being insurmountable.

O3 Problem & Solution

The Innovation

A platform where fans get a direct Vote in their favorite sports
organizations, connect and help fund new sports and esports
entities

The Socios.com platform, powered by the Chiliz token - a

team crowd-management system that empowers fans to take a
meaningful, active hand in guiding various decision making and
influencer events for their favourite professional sports and esports
teams. This is made possible via the novel application of a scalable,
blockchain-based Fan Token purchasing and utility infrastructure;
brought to life through the secure, trustless deployment of
tokenized voting rights and executed via smart contracts on the
Socios.com platform.

This Chiliz-fueled blockchain solution turns team management
into an entertainment proposition in its own right, gamifying voting
rights into a trading & re-trading experience. Every fan's voting
decision will directly affect real-world sports and esports teams,

as well as any other partnered organizations. Socios.com’s fan-
controlled teams can operate in both existing sports & esports
infrastructures - competing independently in conventional events
such as The Premiere League, La Liga, and etc. for football or
Dreamhack, ESL and etc. for esports (as conceptual examples
only) - or in new emerging sports entertainment environments.

whichever organisation they've
chosen to support.

* Please note, these are conceptual examples.
Real-world decision making / voting topics for
teams & leagues will vary depending on the
specific title in which they are competing.

Here are some general examples:

O4 Platform Introduction

European Football

Some of the most valuable sports franchises such as FC Barcelona, Real Madrid,
FC Porto & SL Benfica are owned & partly managed by ‘Socios’ - groups of tens
of thousands of club supporters who actively vote to elect their teams’ board
members and leaders. No single ‘Socio’ can have monopolistic voting power and
as aresult, everyone has a hand in guiding top level management decisions.

The NFL

The Green Bay Packers are the only
community-owned team in the NFL - with
360,584 current stockholders, none of
whom are allowed to own more than 4% of
the team's 5m+ shares at any one time.

FAN TOREN

Top tier football clubs including Paris Saint-Germain & Juventus will officially become the first
teams to be ‘tokenized’ on Socios.com

As it's first practical user-ready application, the Socios.com platform will create a crowd-voting
economy for the Football sports vertical. To kick-start this, the platform has finalized and announced
multi-year partnerships with Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus as its first 2 cornerstone clubs.
Additional top tier clubs are due to be on-boarded in the near term as well.

As the official home of the Paris Saint-Germain & Juventus Official Fan Tokens, both clubs have
followed a format which will serve as Socios.com’s blueprint for on-boarding moving forward. Clubs will
off-load a predetermined level of influence power to their fans - to be decided by the clubs themselves -
with the Socios.com platform generating a set supply of Fan Tokens in exchange.

Fans purchase these Fan Tokens and use the platform to interact with on-demand surveys opened by
clubs. Anyone who has at least 1 Fan Token is eligible to vote, and every incremental ‘voice’ attached to
each Fan Token counts equally.

The fans speak, the clubs listen.

O6 Socios.com Platform: Features 33

The team-specific engines that run every decision in the Socios.com platform

All sports and esports teams - independent or league-tied - operating in the Socios.com platform will debut with a specified, finite
number of Fan Tokens tied to concrete voting rights. Fans who obtain voting rights by trading Chiliz tokens for Fan Tokens, gain a
decision-making right for that team. Each vote is executed as a group of smart contracts, wherein fans leverage their ownership of Fan
Tokens to ‘send’ them to various answers in a given pole. Once a certain engagement threshold is met, all voting results become valid,
with all votes and vote results stored in Socios.com’s side blockchain for transparency.

Maintaining Team Management Integrity

Every team operating on the Socios.com platform will run their own semi-autonomous organizations - implementing democratic rules to
poll FanToken holders about every team-related decision. These semi-autonomous organizations consist of smart contracts executed on
the Socios.com side blockchain, guaranteeing integrity by ensuring that only Fan Token holders can participate and therefore influence
it proportionally to the number of Fan Tokens they own. Blockchain-managed votes are publicly auditable, ensuring that neither the
Socios.com platform nor the organisations fuelled by it, can manipulate voting results or ignore fan crowd-guidance.

Offerings*

“Fan Token Offerings, as well
as Fan Tokens fall outside
the scope of this White
Paper — they are mentioned
in this White Paper by way
of reference only and are
Strictly not regulated by the
contents hereof.

O6 Socios.com Platform: Features 34

A democratic solution for fans to purchase first-offer Fan Tokens from newly introduced organizations on Socios.com

When a new organization goes live on Socios.com, their supply

of Fan Tokens is offered for purchase by fans on a first come, first
served basis as a fixed price point. Only after Fan Tokens are in
the hands of fans, can they be listed or re-listed on Socios.com’s
shared marketplace. This fixed-price ‘order line’ is in place to
ensure that the first chance to purchase any given Fan Tokens is a
transparent and fair experience for users.

How Fan Token Offerings Work

Together with Socios.com, each new team on-boarded to the
platform decides on an initial Chiliz-pegged value for their Fan
Tokens. This is a fixed, base price (in $CHZ) at which all fans can
publicly purchase specific Fan Tokens on first release.

Buying accessibility for these first-run Fan Tokens functions as a
virtual line. Fans pre-order a set amount of tokens before release,
with orders fulfilled in the order in which they’re placed.

Fan Token Offerings run under volume consideration as well.

This means that single user has a capped amount of Fan Tokens
which they can pre-order for any team. This may fluctuate on an
organization-by-organization basis, but the end goal of capping
remains the same - to ensure that no single user is able to buy up
a monopoly of Fan Tokens. These user by user caps for ownership
are maintained even after a new organization's Fan Token Offering
period expires and their Fan Tokens go live on the Socios.com
marketplace.
Buying &
Selling
Fan Tokens

O6 Socios.com Platform: Features 35

A gamified marketplace where fans acquire, sell & grow their ‘Fan Token Portfolio’

Fans who are in control of 1 or more Fan Tokens on Socios.com
gain access to the Socios.com marketplace. Here fans can
auction off the voting rights (Fan Tokens) they hold. This dynamic,
gamified system allows users to leverage their ownership positions
to exchange Fan Tokens for Chiliz at dynamic rates. What this
means:

Users are free to list their Fan Tokens at any price they wish -

for example 20 Chiliz for a specific Fan Token - but that doesn’t
guarantee they'll be sold. For any given team’s marketplace, only
the cheapest Fan Token price is visible to buyers. Once that token
is purchased, the next cheapest price becomes visible and acts as
that Fan Token’s current public value. Each Fan Token price point
in the Socios.com shared marketplace is updated in real-time, so
where and when users decide to buy or sell Fan Tokens becomes a
strategic consideration - similarly to a normal market or exchange.

With regard to selling, fans who auction off their Fan Tokens can
use their accrued Chiliz to diversify the Fan Tokens they hold
across teams or other entities, or to keep building their voting
stewardship in a single team.

A Gamified Economy & Business Model: The Socios.com
marketplace ensures that Chiliz tokens have real utility. Traded ina
sub environment, the acquisition of voting rights in a fan's favourite
teams becomes a meta-game in itself. Trading micro-fees taken by
the platform also represent a sustainable business model to fuel
the Socios.com platform as a whole.

O7 Technology & Values 37

Transparency and auditability: Core ethos for Chiliz & Socios.com

Our commitments both to future users of the Socios.com
platform and the organisations fueled by the Chiliz token are
clear:

For our users: To be the currency and platform which together
act as a decision-making engine of the fans, giving them a way
to meaningfully influence their favourite teams with complete
integrity.

For our partner organisations: To create and share revenue
generated via the Socios.com platform in a fair & transparent way.

Trust in our currency and the platforms and products its made

to power is important - both for our users and our partners - but
we understand that trust alone is not enough when it comes to
ensuring that voting rights will be exercised fairly and that revenue
will be accounted for accurately. As a technological foundation,
blockchain is the de-facto choice to do so in an eloquent manner.

To ensure integrity, we run our own permissioned instance of the
Ethereum blockchain. This permissioned sidechain is the core
of Socios.com. It hosts every team, league, game title or other
organisation who connects with the platform, together with

each organisation's crowd voting mechanisms run as a Semi-
autonomous organization on this blockchain.

Running our own permissioned sidechain will drastically reduce
transaction costs by allowing the use of a Proof of Authority

(PoA) consensus algorithm to confirm each new block of the
permissioned chain - with each block storing polling/ decision
results - instead of necessitating the use of Proof of Work (PoW)
consensus. Other than being a scalability solution, this system also
ensure transparency as Socios.com’s PoA sidechain will be publicly
auditable.
~
N

Auditability

On the permissioned sidechain:

Everything occurring on the Socios.com platform in terms of voting
& trading is stored in an auditable, permanent manner via public
ledger on our permissioned blockchain.

On the main Ethereum blockchain:

Everything that occurs on the Socios.com platform in terms of
chilliZ ERC20 transactions - new accruement of Fan Tokens
converted from Chiliz (6CHZ) tokens and Socios.com account
balance exchanges as part of the platforms other service features -
will be stored in an auditable, permanent manner via public ledger
on the main Ethereum blockchain.

O7 Technology & Values 38

The Socios.com platform will serve as an oracle connecting our
permissioned sidechain to the main Ethereum blockchain:

Chiliz (BCHZ) Tokens will be emitted on the main Ethereum
blockchain, while partner-specific Fan Tokens will be emitted on
our permissioned sidechain. This means that on a functional level
the Socios.com platform itself serves as the only bridge which
enables the exchange of Chiliz tokens and Fan Tokens (and vice
versa).

The Socios.com platform's public ledgers, which together chronicle
a full history of platform-wide transactions, can be audited by
anyone, namely the fans who entrust us to give them a legitimate
set of voting rights.
Utilizing the
Ethereum
Protocol & the
ERC20 Token
Standard

What is Ethereum?
In the words of the founders:

"Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts:
applications that run exactly as programmed without any
possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party
interference.

These apps run on a custom built blockchain, an enormously
powerful shared global infrastructure that can move value around
and represent the ownership of property.

This enables developers to create markets, store registries of debts
or promises, move funds in accordance with instructions given
long in the past (like a will or a futures contract) and many other
things that have not been invented yet, all without a middleman or
counterparty risk.

The project was bootstrapped via an ether presale in August 2014
by fans all around the world. It is developed by the Ethereum
Foundation, a Swiss non-profit, with contributions from great
minds across the globe."

-www.ethereum.org

O7 Technology & Values

What is the ERC 20 Token Standard?

ERC20 is one of many different protocol standards on
the Ethereum network for issuing tokens. "ERC20" itself
simply means ‘Ethereum Request for Comment 20",
with the number 20 serving as a unique identifier of this
specific standard.

For a token to be considered ERC20 compliant, it needs
to feature this standard's necessary smart contract ‘rule’
- or function - inclusions. There's 6 mandatory functions
and an additional 3 optional functions which dicate if a
token is ERC20 compliant or not. You can learn more
about what these are in specific terms here.

In terms of top-line scope, the central benefits of
compliancy with ERC20 standards for Chiliz lies in the
popularity of the standard type itself, wherein its integrity
as atech and protocal standard are well documented.
The proliferation of ERC20 standard has also streamlined
exchangability and liquidity for these token types .

Why Ethereum?

O7 Technology & Values AO

Ten reasons the Socios.com permissioned sidechain is based on Ethereum

1. We believe in the spirit of open source development, having
found inspiration from innovations created by open source
communities for the last 15 years.

2. Ethereum provides a complete toolkit for developers to build
Apps, Smart Contract and other blockchain based solutions.

3. Ethereum and Solidity - its smart contract scripting language is
supported by a very well-established and active community.

4. Compared to other blockchains that have not delivered on use-
case promises, Ethereum is a proven technology running live
applications by the thousands.

5. Ethereum comes with a Turing complete smart contract
scripting language.

6. Ethereum is a mature ecosystem where tools like Parity, Truffle
or Open Zeppelin continue to push quality and security upwards.

7. Ethereum’s vast choice of consensus algorithms (including
Proof of Authority) allows any chain topology, including
permissioned chains.

8. Ethereum has much higher performance when deployed on
permissioned chains.

9. Ethereum is ‘future proof when considering its roadmap
(Metropolis and Serenity phases), which paves the way for things
like Proof of Stake, Sharding or Plasma chains.

10. With communities - including the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance
- rallying around the environment, Ethereum benefits from the
consensus-confidence of it’s diversely focused active adopters.

team” fans and casual global fans alike. Whether fans want
to leverage their token driven influence rights to help guide

a single team, or want to interact with multiple teams across
different sports, Socios.com is your gateway to do it.

1. Introduction

The financial crisis turned the world upside down. It shattered trust
in legacy institutions and shaped a whole generation of young peop-
le. In the meantime, Bitcoin captured the hearts and minds of those
same people. It piqued their interest in saving, investing and perso-
nal finance again. And yet investing is still a pain. Investing in 2019
feels a lot like investing in 2009. You have to put up with poor user
experience, unnecessary bureaucracy and high entry costs.

Our mission is to tear down those barriers and make investing in
digital assets as easy as ordering a pizza or a taxi.

Bitpanda is Europe‘s leading platform for digital assets. Around 1
million users can easily and securely buy, sell and hold Bitcoin as
well as more than 25 crypto assets including digitised gold and
silver. Based in Vienna, Austria, we employ over 100 talented people
from over 30 countries. The new Bitpanda headquarters is located
in the heart of Vienna and comprises around 3,000 square meters to
have enough space to grow. In April 2019, Bitpanda received a PSD2
payment service provider license from the Austrian financial market
authority (FMA) in accordance with European law.

Our guiding principle has been from the beginning, to deliver the
simplest User-Experience (UX) combined with the highest security
standards. This allowed us to continuously grow since the compa-
ny‘s foundation in 2014 and become well recognised within the Eu-
ropean crypto-community. Bitpanda developed a strong reputation
for being an easy-to-use, highly secure and trustworthy platform.

This vision paper introduces the Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) of the
Bitpanda Ecosystem Token (BEST). BEST has been created based on
our vision of Bitpanda and the needs of the Bitpanda community and
beyond. BEST presents a significant opportunity for both existing
and future Bitpanda users. Bitpanda intends to sell up to 500 million
BEST tokens.

This document outlines our vision of Bitpanda, the Bitpanda eco-
system and all the details on BEST.

We invite you to be part of our vision through
participating in BEST!

2.1 The state of investing

Investing needs to be reinvented.

Investing in 2019 feels a lot like investing in 2009. As a user, you still
have to deal with poor user experience, a lot of bureaucracy, out-
dated infrastructures, lousy advice from bank advisors, high entry
costs and basically the same old stuff you are used to, repackaged
in an app.

The digital generation simply demands more. Moreover, while being
the largest generation to date, there are also three major trends
happening connected to their global aggregated net worth:

1. First, the age group from 18 to 34 is about to enter their
prime earning years, which means more liquidity and mo-
ney to invest.

2. Second, being self-employed is one of the fundamental
aspirations for this generation. 54% plan to start their
own business while 27% are already self-employed.

3. Third, they are about to inherit massive wealth from their
baby boomer parents. Both potentially means further ac-
celeration of net worth.

However, more net worth and liquidity don’t solve existing prob-
lems.

Investing needs to be reinvented. The whole industry has to
restructure itself to survive.

While this new generation of investors wants to invest and save
money, they don’t want their parent’s investment advisors and out-
dated products anymore. They want to reach their financial goals in
a more transparent, self-determined way. They also want to invest
where and whenever they are. Almost 90% of them check their
smartphone within the first 15 minutes of waking up.

Now it’s up to us to give them the right tools and products.

2.2 Bitpanda’s vision

Easy, safe and trustworthy access to digital assets.

Bitpanda is on a mission. Our goal is to tear down barriers and make
investing in digital assets as easy as ordering a pizza or a taxi. We are
rethinking and reinventing investing. We are applying the three key
learnings from cryptocurrencies to the traditional world of investing:
transferability, availability and divisibility.

1. Bitcoin and blockchain technology showed us that borders do
not matter anymore for digital assets. The goal is to connect the
financial world in a way that the internet did with information.
Lower the barriers, make it fair and let everyone participate.

2. Cryptocurrencies also showed that people want to be able to
trade whenever they want. No opening hours, no closed trading.
Instead, 24/7, 365 days a year availability.

3. Also, the digitisation of assets also allows a so far unprece-
dented possibility of divisibility. For example, 1 Bitcoin consists
of 100 million Satoshis (the smallest Bitcoin unit, think ‘cents’),
so the digitisation of physical assets like gold allows us to trade,
store and send really small amounts. This takes away entry bar-
riers and lowers the minimum investment amounts.

At Bitpanda, we are firm believers in the innovative power of digital
assets and blockchain technology. This belief is at the core of our
mission: to be the key driving force in the ongoing fintech revolution
by providing easy-to-use, safe and trustworthy access to digital as-
sets for both new and experienced users.

Bitpanda will expand its current platform to transition from the lea-
ding crypto asset broker to the leading digital investment platform.
Our goal is to offer the same advantages and convenience of investing
in cryptocurrencies (no or very short waiting times; 24/7 accessibility;
exchangeability between different assets) to several new asset clas-
ses. We already launched Bitpanda Metals, with which we are revolu-
tionising precious metals trading by digitising physical gold and silver.

Going forward we will leverage blockchain technology so you will be
able to invest even small amounts in any asset class, participate in
gains and spend fractions buying goods - at any time.

Around the Bitpanda platform, a strong ecosystem will be established.
Starting with the Bitpanda Global Exchange, the ecosystem will provi-
de additional value to users by introducing new products and services.
The Bitpanda Global Exchange is 100% in-house developed and will
provide a highly liquid marketplace for crypto assets starting summer
2019. We aim to bring all digital asset classes to the Bitpanda Global
Exchange to enable trading for all of them.

The Bitpanda Ecosystem Token (BEST) offers the growing communi-
ty of around 1 million Bitpanda users* a wide range of rewards and
benefits for use on Bitpanda products and services. Bitpanda users
holding BEST will enjoy up to 25% fee reduction on Bitpanda transac-
tions, gain access to the Bitpanda Launchpad, which will be available
later, and get exclusive access to upcoming features and rewards.

BEST presents a major opportunity for existing Bitpanda users and tho-
se who wish to use Bitpanda‘s platform and services in the future.

2.3 How to achieve the vision

Driven by our passionate founders Eric Demuth (CEO), Paul Klanschek
(CEO) and Christian Trummer (CTO) we believe that our simplification
of investing in crypto assets in combination with technology can be
leveraged to other asset classes besides crypto assets. We developed
digitised precious metals such as Gold and Silver to show that any
asset can be made easy-to-invest-in the same way that crypto assets
are.

We are already working on the digitisation of additional asset classes
to offer them directly on our platform. This will enable you, as a user,
to easily invest in all major asset classes directly on the Bitpanda
platform and use all our services that are available for cryptocurren-
cies, including Savings and Swap.

The Bitpanda platform is in the centre of a strong ecosystem and its
three cornerstones: (1) Bitpanda Global Exchange, (2) Bitpanda Pay-
ments and (3) third party services. Bitpanda will make digitised assets
tradeable for professional traders via the Bitpanda Global Exchange.
All digital assets will also be spendable for everyday use, such as
buying groceries via Bitpanda Payments. Additional services and pro-
ducts will be offered in cooperation with third parties by using
Bitpanda’s open API architecture.

*Please note, that you have to be a registered Bitpanda user in or-
der to benefit from the BEST advantages on our Bitpanda systems.

2.4 Bitpanda platform

The Bitpanda digital investment platform is Bitpanda’s existing easy-
to-use online platform offering retail customers the opportunity to
buy, sell and hold digital assets. It is offered as a web client (website)
as well as a mobile application for Android (Android App) and will be
offered for iOS. The iOS App is currently under development and will
be finalised in the next few months. Through a high quality user ex-
perience (UX) users do not need to worry about any storage or other
technical challenges for digitised assets. The unique proposition of
the broker is the offering of innovative products on digitised assets,
e.g:

* Swap: Interchange every digital asset instantly
* Savings Plan: Enables easy set-up for automated, regular savings

«And many more to come

2.5 Bitpanda Global Exchange

The Bitpanda Exchange has been developed in-house by our dedicated
exchange team of 15 highly skilled people. Its state of the art platform will
make all digital assets tradeable on the Bitpanda Global Exchange. Further-
more, it will also act as an intermediary to ensure supply and demand for
the Bitpanda platform. Targeting professional traders, the exchange offers
professional trading solutions, price matching capabilities and fully au-
tomated clearing, settlement and netting processes. The Bitpanda Global
Exchange enables traders to trade crypto assets and other digital assets at
competitive costs. Additionally, the Bitpanda platform will be able to trade
on the exchange within its own value chain and sustain liquidity.

2.6 Bitpanda Launchpad

To enable companies to acquire capital as well as to offer unique
investment opportunities to Bitpanda users (e.g. investments in Real
Estate) through an Initial Exchange Offering (IEO), Bitpanda will de-
velop the Bitpanda Launchpad. The Bitpanda Launchpad will be a
user-friendly process to guide investment opportunities and com-
panies through a simple issuing process and successful launching
of their individual token offering. Bitpanda will provide hands-on
consultancy for full spectrum IEO (Initial Exchange Offering) creation
and launch needs. This service will enable companies to launch their
token offering with a combined listing on Bitpanda Global Exchange
and direct access to a large user group on Bitpanda. Bitpanda users
will get direct access to invest in these IEOs on the Bitpanda digital
investment platform.

2.7 Bitpanda Payments

Bitpanda Payments is a fully regulated Payment Service Provider of
the Financial Market Authority of Austria. It opens digital assets to
payment transactions and is the link between today‘s existing pay-
ment infrastructure and the new world of digital assets. Users will be
able to pay with any digital asset at an existing point of sale. Through
offering transaction features within Bitpanda, users will be able to pay
e.g. bills or for groceries with any digital asset.

2.8 Technology

Driven by our vision to provide the highest quality user experience, we
have built a highly scalable and open platform architecture on which
all Bitpanda services are provided. We launched the new Bitpanda
platform in Q2/2018 and have continuously been developing it since.
The Bitpanda Global Exchange is based on the same technical princip-
les and is optimised for high-performance trading activities.

Developing technology at Bitpanda follows our three
technology principles:

1. State-of-the-art code - we are using leading open-source frame-
works to continuously develop scalable code for the platform. This
enables us to always have control over our whole code basis and
helps us to design it to best suit the needs of our users.

2. Security as a paradigm - The Bitpanda architecture enables us

to have highly secure cold storage facilities for all digital assets
offered. This utilises innovative cold wallet technology and full
hardware security solutions to enable users to securely store their
digital assets.

3. Based on Blockchain - A dedicated team of Blockchain enthusiasts
are working on connecting and integrating different blockchain
technologies on our platform. This enables us to deliver a variety
of crypto assets and makes us experts in Blockchain technology.

2.9 KYC & AML

Bitpanda fulfils financial service industry standards for KYC (Know
Your Customer) and AML (Anti Money Laundering) procedures and pro-
cesses according to Austrian and European law standards. Furthermo-
re, applicable guidelines and recommendations by the Financial Mar-
ket Authority of Austria have been implemented. Due to the specific
business area, custom safety precautions are implemented according
to Bitpanda’s business model. These aim to identify, prevent and eli-
minate money laundering and fraud cases. Moreover, Bitpanda screens
all customers concerning various other aspects which are not legally
required, but crucial for fraud or crime prevention. Bitpanda is fully
compliant with laws and regulations within the EU as well as Austria.
To sum up, Bitpanda is and will be in-line with applicable regulations
and will fulfil the 5th EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive.

2.10 Team

The Bitpanda team consists of more than 100 highly talented indivi-
duals from 31 nationalities. More than half of the employees are best
in class software and blockchain developers, while the other half are
experienced professionals in their individual fields. To comply with
future demand on the regulatory side, Bitpanda has also recruited
professionals from the FMA (Financial Market Authority of Austria),
leading law firms, the chamber of commerce, leading banks and
former entrepreneurs. They are all based in the new Bitpanda
headquarters in the heart of Vienna.

All employees share the vision and are driven by the idea of shaping
the future of the financial services industry. Bitpanda fosters an
innovative corporate culture where new ideas are always embraced
and achievements are immediately recognised. Bitpanda is growing
rapidly and expanding its team. All job listings can be found on the
Bitpanda website.

Paul Klanschek, CEO

Paul Klanschek first heard of Bitcoin back in 2010 and
has been fascinated by the implications of blockchain
technology on the financial sector and other industries
ever since. He successfully finished his Masters at the
WU Wien in banking and finance. Paul is well estab-
lished within the global crypto community and was
involved at popular cryptocurrency projects like NXT,
Waves, Lisk, Komodo, and more. Furthermore, Paul is
actively shaping the regulatory and political opinion on
crypto assets through his appointment to the Fintech
Advisory Council of the Ministry of Finance. Paul was
nominated on the “Forbes 30 under 30” list of the
most influential people under 30 years old.

Eric Demuth, CEO

Eric Demuth is an entrepreneur with an eSports
background. Whilst active in the financial industry in
London and Vienna since 2009, he also founded his
first company. Frustrated by how hard it was to buy
and sell crypto assets like Bitcoin, he co-founded
Bitpanda. Before all this, he travelled the world on
Hapag-Lloyd container ships while working as a ship
mechanic, followed by economic studies at the Vienna
University of Economics and Business and the London
School of Economics & Political Science (LSE). Eric ac-
tively shapes the world-wide crypto community as an

opinion leader in several fields.

Christian Trummer, CTO

Christian Trummer is a software developer and entre-
preneur. After founding three software companies and
being involved in the crypto community since 2012, he
co-founded Bitpanda. As the CTO, he oversees all as-
pects of development. Christian is a respected expert
in his field and well known within the European crypto
development community. Christian ensures a state of
the art technology stack as well as the highest stan-

dards within the development staff.
2.11 Pantos

Pantos is an initiative conceived by the team behind Bitpanda. It is
researched and developed in close collaboration with the TU Wien.
As the first multi-blockchain token system, Pantos aims to bring
blockchain projects closer together, improve communication bet-
ween developers, researchers and users, and set innovative stan-
dards for cross-chain token transfers.

Under the framework of the Austrian national initiative for Open
Innovation, we aim to encourage cooperation between various
projects in the crypto economy. In its first year, the Pantos project
has successfully finished the initial research for Token Atomic Swap
Technology (TAST). The Distributed Systems Group at the TU Wien
has published four Technical White Papers and developed the TAST
research prototype (DeXTT: Deterministic Cross-Blockchain Token
Transfers), which is fully documented and available on GitHub. This
prototype demonstrates how the concepts and approaches we have
developed and described in theory can be implemented in practice.
In upcoming research, the team will further simplify the approach
presented in our latest paper, and we want to extend the functiona-
lity we have developed so far to enable additional, exciting features.
For instance, we would like to enable smart contract invocations
across blockchains. The basis we have developed so far seems very
promising in this regard.

Pantos’ goal is to serve as a lighthouse project in an increasingly
fragmented blockchain space. With multiple blockchains serving all
kinds of different purposes, Pantos is seeking to allow these pro-
jects to talk to one another in a standardised way. This will speed
up innovation by creating a link between blockchains which can
then scale together. Living up to their reputation as highly esteemed
partners of innovation-oriented enterprises, the TU Wien provides
us with dedicated research staff for a joint project entitled ‘Token
Atomic Swap Technologies’ (TAST). The project is supervised by Dr.
Stefan Schulte, Assistant Professor for Industrial Cyber-Physical
Systems at the TU Wien. The core aim of TAST is the introduction of
atomic swap technologies into the Pantos Project by the Distributed
Systems Group (DSG) of the TU Wien. Based on insights gained from
this project, prototypes of on-chain atomic swaps will be built to
demonstrate the mass market suitability.

The key difference between Pantos and BEST is that Pantos is a
scientific research project, which aims to solve one of the key
technical barriers in the crypto and digital asset space: interoperabi-
lity between blockchains. BEST, on the other hand, is an ecosystem

token for the expanding Bitpanda ecosystem, which aims to be highly
usable, very attractive as an investment and which will come with a
lot of direct benefits for Bitpanda users.

While the scope and features of Pantos and BEST are not the same,
we aim to bring the technology developed within the Pantos project to
BEST and the whole Bitpanda ecosystem. We will incorporate Pantos
technology as soon as it’s production ready. For example, IEOs perfor-
med on the Bitpanda Launchpad could use Pantos technology in the
future.

2.12 Excursus: digital assets

Digital assets will create a completely new market within the financial
services industry and are the backbone of Bitpanda‘s vision. Digital as-
sets aim to revolutionise how assets are traded, such as real estate or
stocks, and provide access to a broad customer base. The main value
is derived from the utility of using tokens as a substitute for paper
deeds, proof of ownership and contracts. The advantages of digital as-
sets are derived from their characteristics of digital transferability, di-
rect divisibility, a variable fee structure and a 24/7 market place. This
enables users to invest small amounts into fractions of digital assets
around the clock. People investing just €10 get the same performance
as people investing €10.000. Casual investors get the same low fee
treatment as wealthy investors used to get in the past.

To become a digital asset platform, one of the main tasks is to digiti-
se the underlying assets and ensure that both technical and regula-
tory requirements are fully met. The first digital assets were derived
from digital currencies, of which more than 25 are already tradeable
on the Bitpanda platform, e.g. (BTC, ETH, MIOTA, PAN, ...). Additionally
stablecoins (e.g. USDT) and four fiat currencies (EUR, GBP, USD, CHF)
have been digitised and are tradeable on the platform. As of May 2019,
precious metals such as Gold and Silver are digitised and tradeable at
Bitpanda.

3. Bitpanda Ecosystem
Token

3.1 Overview

BEST - Bitpanda Ecosystem Token will be issued by Bitpanda through
an Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) on the Bitpanda platform (www.
bitpanda.com/best). BEST will be issued on the Ethereum Blockchain
as an ERC20 token. An amount of 1 billion BEST will be created, ne-
ver to be increased. As part of the Initial Exchange Offering a maxi-
mum of 500,000,000 BEST will be offered.

Directly after the IEO, BEST will be listed and tradeable on the Bit-
panda Global Exchange against the available fiat currencies as well
as Bitcoin (BTC). Afterwards, BEST will be added to Bitpanda’s digital
investment platform as well.

3.2 Value of BEST for Bitpanda users

Bitpanda users owning and using BEST will get the most out of the
Bitpanda ecosystem by using and holding tokens of BEST.

Bitpanda users will benefit by getting (1) discounts when paying fees
on Bitpanda with BEST (as outlined in 3.4), (2) perks based on certain
amounts of holding BEST (3) access to the future Bitpanda Launch-
pad and (4) access to additional future products.

3.2.1 Fee discounts

Bitpanda will offer certain discounts for users paying their Bitpanda
fees with BEST (within the whole Bitpanda ecosystem). This can be
for example trading fees, listing fees or other fees. These discounts
are applicable to all Bitpanda products such as the Bitpanda plat-

form, the Bitpanda Global Exchange or Bitpanda Payments (as out-

lined in 3.4).

Minimum BEST value for fees

When a Bitpanda user pays fees on Bitpanda in BEST, the value of
BEST is either its current market value or, if the market value is lower
than the applicable Minimum BEST value for fees (e.g. 0.12 EUR in year
1), an equivalent of the Minimum BEST value for fees (e.g. 0.12 EUR in
year 1). This ensures that BEST always has a value of at least the Mini-
mum BEST value for fees when paying fees on Bitpanda. Furthermore
the Minimum BEST value for fees is addition to the fee discounts. This
means that 1 BEST has a Minimum value for fees of 0.12 EUR on
Bitpanda in year 1, plus users get an additional 25% discount for pay-
ing fees in the Bitpanda ecosystem.

Please note that this minimum value exclusively applies for Bitpanda
users and Bitpanda services. Bitpanda does not guarantee any value of
BEST outside the Bitpanda ecosystem.

The Minimum BEST value for fees increases in the first 5 years over
time by 10% each year.

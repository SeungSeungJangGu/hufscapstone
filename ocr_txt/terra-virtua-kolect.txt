~ WELCOME TO TERRA VIRTUA"

VR hardware is dominating and disrupting the entertainment
industries. Predicted to grow to $200bn+ over the next 5
years, the VR industry will become ubiquitous and prime

for consumer hubs and platforms. Terra Virtua” will offer

a unique Netflix-style subscription service to access VR
content across games, eSports, movies, live events and
more. Such a model is a major differentiator from traditional
games product stores such as Steam which provides
outright purchase of each and every game/app.

A brand new cryptocurrency, the TERRA token coin (ticker TVT’) Box

will work as the currency within the platform allowing consumers . aa rae
access to the content. The coin will also facilitate VR developers

access to zones within Terra Virtua to host their own content that

Partnerships with Gaming Developers, eSports Platforms,
Entertainment Media, Music Event Broadcasters and more

consumers all benefiting from the TERRA cryptocurrency.

As the platform evolves there will be additional opportunities
such as in-game and user-generated content to buy along

headset but still wants to interact with Terra Virtua, they simply
open their app.

Via the app, Players will browse the marketplace for in-game
boosters or add-ons, be pushed new and engaging content, special
offers and can add shortcuts to new experiences they may want to
try later in Terra Virtua. Players can update their VFlect and can also
interact with other players’ Vflects via the app.

The app will announce new attractions and offer more information
(trailers, etc]. It will enable you to bookmark your favourite
experiences so that you can navigate quicker when you visit Terra
Virtua. You can store your achievements, rank, status for different
games and display leaderboards if relevant. The app acts asa
messaging and meeting system between the visitor and their friends
and will also allow interaction directly with their Vflect in fun single

The eSports market, like VR is set for significant growth which
brings another highly-sought market to the Terra Virtua

value proposition. Newzoo has forecasted esports revenue to
grow to $1.5b by 2020 with brand investment doubling by this
point. Terra Virtua is designed to broadcast not only VR based
eSports but also all types of eSports through the unique
perspective of a VR headset.

TERRA VIRTUA CURRENCY-TECHNOLOGY

Terra Virtua’s identity and gameplay data storage will be based on a
blockchain-secured network. Player accounts and the most important
game data (e.g. ownership of valuable items) are stored and protected
with an encrypted name/value store added and continuously updated
directly into the Terra Virtua” blockchain.

Blockchain-based timestamps will also be used, so if disputes arise ina
game channel analogous to “closing” a Bitcoin payment channel, they can
be resolved by referring back to the record of events immutably recorded
on this blockchain and tracked by the timestamp. By mixing the time-
stamping property of blockchain technology we've been able to
develop a fraudproof protocol that ensures the occurring data can
never be lost or manipulated for any Terra Virtua participants.

Based on this proven technology, our blockchain will
implement game accounts and tradable in-game items
in a way where you attach Terra Virtua assets to an
encrypted, secure blockchain. This ensures that

heir ownership is securely tracked, and it enables
rustless trades - no central middleman required -

or exchanging TERRA [TVT] or exchanging items.

This works by transferring both the sold item and

WHITE PAPER
TERRA VIRTUA CURRENCY-TECHNOLOGY

the corresponding payment in TERRA or between the two participants of a trade
in a single transaction and governed by a smart, self executing contracts.

This transaction needs to be verified by both parties, so that either both
transfers happen or none. This prevents fraud where just a payment is

made and the Item isn’t transferred, or vice versa.

Gamers will get more for their money on our platform. Game developers
will incentivize gamers to use TERRA through in-game coupons and
rewards. Terra Virtua” TERRA holders will be able to earn additional
discounts when purchasing in-game content.

Our platform payment gateway allows gamers many more options for

payment. Google and Apple only allow deposits from credit cards; the app plans
to allow the use of credit cards, Bitcoin, Ether, TERRA, and various local payment
methods.

Unlike Google, Apple and Steam that have strict deposit limit amounts,
our platform will allow for unlimited deposits and withdrawals.

Terra Virtua” is a platform offering consumers access to high
quality, entertaining and compelling content, including:

e Self-developed: A Terra Virtua-commissioned studio creating at
least 5 exclusive games for launch. These will include Space Jump,
Fish Evolution, Jet Man, OMG and Escape Series: Museum Heist.

¢ Incentivised third-party development - we will offer targeted
developers a Terra Virtua zone upon which they will operate their
game and then own outright.

¢ Paid third-party development: A significant proportion of the money
raised via the ICO will enable us to either fund ongoing developments
we have identified as being desirable for the platform, or license
popular existing games to be adapted for Terra Virtua.

e User generated content: Users will be able to purchase their own zone in
Terra Virtua using Terra, and use our dedicated tools to create their own
games, experiences or virtual-goods stores.

¢ Unincentivised Third Party development. Interactive content
will be created by developers paying for zones to showcase their
experiences.

Terra Virtua’ will have its own proprietary API (Application Program Interface] allowing developers to easily
adapt their content for use in Terra Virtua. Compatible with all major dedicated VR systems for launch including
HTC Vive and Oculus Rift, support will evolve for smartphones and consoles such as Google Daydream and
Playstation VR.

For developers/publishers the platform offers a supplemental revenue stream which will not conflict or
compromise the traditional ‘store-based’ business that is currently the sole option.

The key benefits below have garnered an overwhelmingly positive response from game developers:
e Fast payments vs 45/60 days from Google, Apple, Steam...

e Anew additional revenue stream to current channels

e Terra Virtua technology allows for bureaucracy-free, fast integration of developers’ content

e In-game assets can be sold securely using tokens. This single currency, valid across games, Is a first; players
can trade the content on the Terra Virtua marketplace or even cash them out on crypto exchanges.

WHITE PAPER PAGE 34
~ INITIAL COIN OFFERING

Terra Virtua” plans to issue TERRA (TV7), a utility token that will be tracked on a public blockchain. To buy/
sell zones or purchase Special Items in the Terra Virtua Ecosystem, customers will pay in TVT. The token
will be initially tracked on the Ethereum blockchain using an ERC20 smart contract. When a sufficiently
viable sidechain or colour coin scheme is available on a more secure public blockchain we will transfer the
value there.

The value proposition to content developers is that they can fully capitalize on the economic interactions between
their in-game experiences and users. To allow those economic interactions, the platform must allow three things to
be traded: in-game currency, goods, and services.

Terra Virtua will integrate a core system that allows global, instant, and cost-effective payments between any two
users on the internet. Cryptocurrencies allow for trustless payment channels to be established between parties, with
low-trust hub-and-spoke systems already possible.

To foster the exchange of virtual goods, economic incentives will be in place to ensure the continued creation and
distribution of avatars, items, etc. Smart Contracts will facilitate the protection and payment for 3rd party content,
ensuring that IP ownership will be securely assigned to the content creator.

- THE COMPANY

The Management Team behind Terra Virtua” is comprised of highly-experienced individuals with an
individual track record of success in video game development, publishing, VR, AR, Blockchain and
entertainment-related business. With the resources of a 30+ strong development studio, a working
prototype is already available.

As content will determine the success of this venture, Terra Virtua is developing not only a number of initial
attractions for its platform but also a suite of tools to allow 3rd-party developers easy integration of their own VR/
MR games and attractions. Because of the association of key management members, we expect to garner significant
support for this platform in the development community.

Although the company is self-sufficient in order to develop and launch, we are looking to raise funds via this ICO in
order to have additional resources to:

e Assist 3rd-party developers with funding resource to create other new content for Terra Virtua
e For marketing and general awareness of the platform

e Expand and accelerate our own development resource and create even more attractions of our own for launch

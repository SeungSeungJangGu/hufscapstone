1.1 Structural Problem of Existing Food Market

Modern food value chain has longer and more complicated structure, not like in the past, Process from producer
to food manufacturer, distribution, and consumers became more complicated than ever. As a result, from the
perspective of manufacturer who have been disconnected from consumers due to distribution channel and
marketing, it is difficult to reflect actual needs in food planning and manufacturing process, From the perspective
of supplier, putting a lot of cost into infrastructure investment and material, it is painful to manufacture without

knowing accurate needs of customers.

Company ROA _ O_O _” Consumer
Consumption of food is expressed more diversely. Modern food is not only to just simply resolve hunger, but
is consumed as one of the cultures. Consumers encounter new food through various food contents broadcasting,
learn various recipes through recipes of every kind, and even consume other people's action of eating through
food porn contents. Various consumer needs occur during these processes, but it is not easier than ever for the
information to be exchanged with producer or food manufacturer.

Asymmetric information, from both sides of supplier and consumer, occurs. Supplier cannot understand
the sudden consumption increase of a specific food. When customer wants to consume food he / she encountered

through broadcasting or contents, it takes a long time for the food to be available in the market.

1.2 Era of Food Profile
(The Rise and Value of Consumer-centered Historical Data with Blockchain Technology)

As Blockchain technology started from Bitcoin and smart contract of Ethereum was combined full scale in 2013,
new approach to solve various problems across society became available. Hintchain will utilize representative
technologies of smart contract and Blockchain technology to solve food industry problems mentioned earlier.
Hintchain will structuralize individual food data of consumers, and provide it to suppliers to match needs of both sides.

Hintchain plans to analyze individual's food data of consumers and inversely provide to suppliers, from traditional
food value chain structure of supplier providing based on market prediction. Through this, Supplier can resolve

issue of excess and deficiency of supply and customers can consume food they want when they want.

Data Structured Smart Contract

The Food Protocol Hintchain White Paper

2, Mission

As everyone has different taste in food, individualized solution is necessary. Individual food data must be
collected in individual unit and structuralized, However, current food related data is distributed over not only

individuals but also various service platform businesses.
What if customers can directly manage their own diet data and personal history?

This is to structuralize food preference, eating habit, personal history, and others as food profile, and store as
data block. Stored data can be connected to supplier through Blockchain with consent from the individual.
Also, data from Blockchain can be provided back to customers as customized food solution, individually specialized
through analysis solution of Hintchain, Through this process, supplier can secure profit and efficient production, and
customers can manage reward of value and analyzed individual food profile. One-way structure from supplier to

customer in the past will be restructured as both-way structure based on food profile through Blockchain technology.
We propose 3 missions as below, utilizing Blockchain technology.

1. Build personal food profile containing data of what food industry customers see, eat, and purchase, and

data of personal history consists of series of food behavior of individuals.

2. Allow customer to have control over all data of his/her own behavior and consumption related to food,

and eating habit. Provide compensation and data utilization if consented.

3. Help customers with matter of choice during food consumption process through analysis of 'habit' and ‘desire'

based on food profile. Provide a window of possible demand prediction based on food profile to companies.

In order to achieve these missions, we propose Hintchain platform. Hintchain platform is a business protocol that
ecosystem participation partners will use together and we will do our best for data centric food industry innovation
by cooperating with various partners, Hintchain team will comply with regulations of Hintchain and create Blockchain

platform not only used in Asia, but in global food market, with partners that will grow the platform together.
The Food Protocol Hintchain White Paper

3, Food Profile

The core of Hintchain platform is (personal) food profile. Food profile is data block to restructure food
industry to be consumer centric.

Food profile is data block that individualized data of customer’s food related (1) body-identity, (2) taste,
(3) habit-behavior, Customers can recover his / her data ownership by directly managing the data, They can

gain benefits as below by using food profile.

A. Analysis of own food profile

Food profile is customized data set analyzed reflecting characteristic of individuals. Therefore, if own food profile
can be linked with services, use of service and discovery of products that are more suitable to the one will be available.
This data set, depending on individual's activity, will be continuously updated and have value as customized
information of higher level.
B. Reward acquisition

Reward can be acquired through inputting data that is necessary for food profile, Until now, data on food
consumption and preference of consumers has not been properly managed or analyzed. They were distributed
on various service platforms, but did not have any value as data. Through Hintchain, value can be given to these

data. Data with value can be utilized, and customers will be granted with reward for it.

3.1 Standards of Food Profile

Food profile includes the whole data such as body information, taste, and preference of an individual. This
refers not only health information inputted by an individual, but also all data Hintchain can structuralize such as

food contents and products consumed online. Data standards are categorized as below.

- Identity & health condition data: Health information such as height, weight, history, and nutritional status.
- Three dimensional data across the diet information including basic meal of customer and others must be loaded on
food profile. For individual components necessary for food profile, Hintchain team will continue studying and

developing with academic and industrial experts and food profile professional advisory group.
- Taste data : For food recommendation, taste information such as data of usual food consumption, and actual diet
review is needed. Also, for convenience, diet and lifestyle information such as preferred receipt, meal pattern,

actual meal time, and place are required.
3.2 Components of Food Profile

3.2.1 Hint ID
Data block with health information and identity that distinguish individuals (on-chain)

Hint ID is a distinct identification value to compose food profile and each customer is given one Hint ID.
When customers register to service of Hintchain protocol, they input basic personal information such as gender and
age. This personal information is inputted into hash function with temporary code by Hintchain and converted into
hash value called Hint ID. Information of body and health is also converted into hash value with the basic personal

information, encrypted, and stored in Hint ID.

Hint ID creation process

f_hash (Distinct value by Hintchain Ox2BD2--- + Coded age 12cd.. + Coded gender 8k23c:::)
= Hash_ID #21k32---

This Hint ID plays a role of identifier that connects health data and taste data of food profile with individuals of
customers. Through Hint ID, various data can be linked with individual's profile. If there is no distinct identification
value, we cannot know if various data is linked with individual’s profile.

In other words, Hint ID, depending on identity each customer creates, can understand customer's diet information

in three dimensions by managing food data synthetically.

@ 3.2.2 Hint IQ
Data block with personal taste information and quantitative numerical score (on-chain)

Hint IQ is data block of quantitative numerical score using algorithm to quantify information of taste and
eating habit. It quantifies and records data block by systematizing food data created by customers in various
services of Hintchain protocol.

Hint |Q categorizes customer's various input data into standards of health, taste and others. It re-divides

these into more detailed standards such as salty, sweet, allergy, and vegetarian preference. Here, Food Meta DB

is used as core DB for categorizing process.
3.2.2.1 Input DB : Input data by customers that is required for Food IQ calculation

Input DB (database) is a bundle and history of data inputted by customers. It is consisted of purchase,

behavior, and review data.

(1) Purchase data

This refers to customer's purchase history data of food related products. The purpose of purchase data is to
monitor series of the flow of in what context the purchase was made. Therefore, instead of analyzing purchase
data fragmentarily, it should be recorded with various situational data through linking with behavior data mentioned
previously. Customer's purchase data is a core data used to predict further actions based on customer's routine

and provide better service.

(2) Behavior data

This refers to data that customers leave in food contents community. Many customers leave behavior data
before and after purchasing products. Behavior data includes various activities such as contents creation, voting,
sharing, and scrap. By analyzing this behavior data, we can understand customer's three dimensional behaviors
and predict potential desire.

For example, if a customer who purchases junk food every day, recently shares health related contents,
we can predict his / her desire towards healthy food service. In food market where customer's taste rapidly
changes, collection of behavior data will greatly contribute in market trend prediction and increase of

efficiency.

(3) Review Data

This refers to review data in contents community that customers left on food they consumed. Review (on
food product, restaurants, and services) data is important in the fields where individuals’ reviews are divided
subjectively, like food industry. Not only detailed review data about food, but also diet data on what was
consumed can be considered as review data. Accumulated log data, different perspective than purchase
history, can be a component to understand and predict customers more three dimensionally through analyzing

diet pattern.
3.2.2.2. Output DB : Classification data and numerical value actually stored in Food 1Q
Based on input DB, Food IQ categorizes taste data and health data and quantifies quantitatively. For example,

customer's liking of spiciness is defined as 10 and if a customer frequently purchases spicy food product,

score of 9 is given. It is classified as below.
(1) Health data
Health data is to know health information of customer. Information such as BMI, medical history, and
nutrition status is available, so we can learn about food that he/she cannot consume and consumed nutrient

during a specific period.

(2) Taste data
Taste data is to know taste and food consumption habit of customer. We can learn about taste, diet, simplicity

(meal consumption time), purchase pattern, and preferred nationality of food.

3.2.3 Hint Score
Data block to calculate correlation between each food profile and food service (off-chain)

Hint Score is data block to calculate and store correlation between each food profile and food service. It is an
element used to recommend optimized service to customers. This data must be continuously recalculated as
new food service or product occurs, it has attributes of temporary data. Therefore, it is meaningless to store

all data on Blockchain network, so it is stored in off block chain.
Process of recommendation service based on Hint Score is as grounds mentioned below.

(1) Compare and decided on correlation between product and Hint IQ (food profile) and understand in numeric
value how suitable the product is to user’s food profile. Then save calculated Hint Score. Method is as follows.
Take metadata of the product and send inquiry to Food Meta DB. Calculate basic Hint Score of the product,
compare, and decide on Hint IQ of food profile. Calculate suitability of the product, then finally calculate and

store Hint Score of suitability between customer and the product.

(2) From the process of (1), take Hint Score, suitability score of each product, based on several product
information. In the order of highest suitability score, the products will be recommended to customers. Detailed

recommendation method or numbers can be changed in app of food profile.

(3) If customer’s food profile has been updated through various behaviors and reviews, Hint Score of each
product will be recalculated. In other words, even product that was recommended to customer before was

encountered, new recommendation based on customer's changed tendency is provided.
The Food Protocol Hintchain White Paper

3.2.4. Food Meta DB - Official database of original form information of food

Food Meta DB is database of metadata standardized basic attribute of food. According to food engineering
and food and nutrition, food composes database of ‘ingredient’ centric data. Food Meta DB is standardized
database of information such as nutrition, content, calories of each ingredient, and categories of taste and
food type. It is used to quantify customer's input data into Food |Q, and is an essential element used to calculate

correlation with service as Food Score.

3.3 Operating Method

Composition of food profile starts from when Hint ID is given to customers participating Hintchain ecosystem.
Various input data of customer linked and accumulated on Hint ID is quantified and stored in Hint 1Q through
data analyzing algorithm. Created food profile can be used and accessed to data block after proper verification
of an app of Hintchain protocol. However, Hintchain will provide 2 service API mentioned in below for enterprise

participants of ecosystem to actively apply food profile to their services.

(1) Hint ID based login service and various API
To freely apply to own service through Hint ID based login service and API, food profile layers will be abstracted

and provided. Enterprise participants can access each data value (Food IQ) of food profile through this API.

(2) Hint Score API

Hint Score API, that provides suitable service to customer by automatically calculating correlation between
food profile and relevant service, will be provided. Enterprise participants can understand customers more
three dimensionally through Hint ID based login service and various API, and deploy efficient service and

business through Hint Score API.

4, Architecture

Hintchain is composed of 3 layers: Data layer, platform layer, and application layer.

Application Layer

All application service programs and businesses

Platform Layer off-chain

Platform database and various data access API
Discovery API of Hintchain

Data Layer on-chain

Hintchain data storage / Hintchain smart contract
Hint ID & Hint IQ

4.1 Data Layer (On-chain)

Data layer is data network of Hintchain to store food profile data, and is a layer to perform data access using
Blockchain technology. Data layer is the most important layer of Hintchain and it operates token economy and

builds food profile using Blockchain technology.

For Hint ID, Hint 1Q, and input DB, core data block of building food profile, hash value of contents and
commerce data, not the whole data, are included in Blockchain network, For contents / commerce data, it is
stored in the database of platform layer due to capacity issue, and uses the latest encryption technology for

security maintenance.

Data layers are divided into the following :
4.1.1 Data storage of Hintchain

Data storage of Hintchain is a virtual database in Blockchain network that includes food profile created in
Hintchain. Data storage grants high reliability to individual food profile and stores safely using Blockchain
technology. This food profile, only with consent from individual, receives personal information protection
management and high level of security of selective inquiry and use through API of platform layer that connects

data layer.
4.1.2 Hintchain Smart Contract

Hintchain smart contract helps utilization and issuance of Hint power and Hint token. Smart contract
becomes basis of regulation for platform ecosystem participants to work token economy based and utilize

for ecosystem activation.

4.2 Platform Layer (Off-chain)

Platform layer is a layer that connects application layer and data layer of Hintchain. It collects various data not
included in Blockchain network in encrypted storage and provides in database format. It also provides various

functions to build service on Hintchain in API format.
4.2.1 Platform Database

Hintchain minimizes data stored in Blockchain network other than smart contract and food profile to increase
scalability and use speed and reduce platform operational cost. Platform database stores data of activities in

ecosystem of users with food profile and metadata value of relevant data.

Platform database can be classified into three depending on storage data type and we plan to build it

using decentralized storage.

(1) Contents community database

Contents community database is a space for storage of contents in community. It builds data field that
contents community applications can record and inquire contents data itself, and allows other applications to
utilize this data. Data stored in relevant field includes metadata such as contents type and attribute, and data

of various formats such as video, photo, and music applicable for the actual contents.
(2) Solution usage behavior database

Metadata such as purchased products of Hintchain customers, basic attribute information, and additional
information and related solution information that other ecosystem participants can reference in future are
stored in relevant field. Based on this data, holistic food solution use behavior (purchase of ingredients,

product purchase, restaurant information, diet management service, and etc.) is provided.

(3) Food information dictionary database (Food Meta DB)
Food information is base metadata that shows what attributes compose relevant food contents (product or
solution in commerce or O20). Various atypical database structures such as suitability between relevant food and

situation and relation with other food occur. Up until now, food related industry professionals have been building

this information into different structures. Hintchain will build common food information dictionary database and,

enhance, and standardize. Participants who contribute in this food information dictionary will be rewarded.
4.2.2 API of Hintchain

Hintchain provides 5 types of API in platform layer that solution service businesses who are participating in
ecosystem can use. In future, Hintchain will open interface of relevant API to public to create environment
where Hintchain participants can freely take parts. Hintchain will build ecosystem with various participants,

and focus on protocol development, the core regulation of ecosystem.

(1) Food discovery API

This is API that allows enterprise participants to find customers satisfying specific conditions based on
food profile. Also, food profile discovery API provides context based recommendation API that provides solution
suitable for specific business context of ecosystem participants. For example, there are targets that require
fulfill ment of special conditions such as customers wanting food solution in a very busy situation and customers
requiring food service relevant for specific health condition. Through this API base, enterprise participants can
easily spot target customers and quickly test products. This allows reduction of overall overhead in food industry

and efficient business.

(2) Solution discovery API (Hint Score API for on/offline commerce player)

Solution discovery API is for developers or commerce enterprise participants who want to find and provide
appropriate solution to specific customers. It is one of Hint Score API mentioned previously in food profile
field. It is API that calculates correlation score based on correlation between food profile, product, and service,
and finds appropriate service based on the calculation.

Solution discovery API also does not stop at simple search and exploration API, but provides business contex

S
recommendation API. For example, it can find commerce and O20 service provider applicable for specific
situation. Then, it can build provided service to user or other enterprise participants as relevant API based,

and utilize potential of Hintchain ecosystem.

(3) Contents discovery API (Hint Score API for content player)

Contents discovery API is for developers / enterprise participants who want to build contents community
service on Hintchain platform. This is one of Hint Score API mentioned previously in food profile field. It operates
by calculating correlation score based on correlation between food profile and contents and searching relevant
contents based on the calculation.

This API also provides context based recommendation API that ecosystem participants can utilize. For example,
enterprise participant can collect contents of high relevance to own food ingredient product, and expose
with own solution. Contents discovery API will be able to maximize service / business utilization of many

contents linked in Hintchain.

(4) Hint ID Login API

Hintchain provides login service in API form for various ecosystem participants to smoothly use food profile
based service. Through this, food profile data input and utilization can be easier.

Hint ID applied services can easily use abundant functions that Hintchain provides as protocol, and better

understand customers with food profile base.

(5) Wallet API

Wallet API supports various wallet app to support Hint protocol. It supports customers to manage Hintchain

and payment function. It also supports management functions for customers to consent or allow information

exposure on purchase data that is part of food profile.
4.3 Application Layer

All solutions that manage and utilize food profile through Hintchain are included here. Applications of all
from running on mobile, app, and web are also included here. These applications can access data within platform
through platform layer. By using API provided in platform layer, various applications that can be linked with
Hintchain can be easily developed and commercialized. Representative useful applications that can be developed

of Hintchain base are as follows.

- Food contents community that rewards participants and producer

@)
- Individualized food commerce service
- Individualized food 020 service

- Food profile based diet management service

4.4 Component and Technical Consideration of Hintchain Platform

Hintchain is developed EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) based. From perspective of time, cost, versatility,
and reliability, implementing EVM based is more efficient than composing own Blockchain network. Hintchain
being developed as EVM based means that it can be operated not only on Ethereum (ETH), but also on various
Blockchain platforms such as Quantum (QTUM) supporting EVM or EOS. Hintchain will select Blockchain
platform for its operation by analyzing market situation and technical completeness of Blockchain platforms.
If there is no platform suitable for Hintchain implementation among existing Blockchain platforms or if it is

estimated that own mainnet implementation is more efficient, we will internally develop our own mainnet.

data accumulation. Hint Power reward is classified as contents community reward, purchase reward, and body

data registration reward. How to receive Hint Power reward is as follows.
5.2.1 Contents community reward

Review data and behavior data are accumulated through contents activity in community. Hence, basic unit
of reward is contents. Power amount provided for individual contents reward is composed of sum of power
amount of contents creator and reaction towards the contents (contents consumers’ share/recommendation
and etc.). Total power amount provided during certain period is fixed. Power provided as reward is given in
differential distribution based on contents contribution scores. Calculation is done biweekly (may be changed).
Aggregated contribution scores for the first calculation will have half life of 3 months starting from creation
date (may be changed). Scores on activities such as share/recommendation after half life will be reflected

during final score calculation

Power Amount Calculation Formula Provided through Contents Reward

* Power amount provided through contents reward = (ContentPoint 2/5" ContentPoint 2 )
*ContentPoint , : Contents ‘a’ contribution score

* ContentPoint , = CreatorPoint , + £4 (a) ViewerPoint ,

* CreatorPoint , : Power retention amount of contents creator

* (a) ViewerPoint, : Share / recommendation amount on contents ‘a’

5.2.2 Purchase reward

Purchase data is accumulated every time customer purchases product or service on on/offline commerce.

Hence, basic unit of reward is purchasing activity.

5.2.3 Personal information and body data of individual food profile registration reward

It is possible to automatically update food profile on Blockchain network through user log analysis of
community and commerce activities, However, individual body data must go through the process of direct input.
To induce such action, Hint Power of proper level is rewarded. Overall quality improvement of food profile

can be achieved through this.
The Food Protocol Hintchain White Paper

6, Value Proposition

6.1 Consumer (Customer)

Customer is a core participant of Hintchain who consumes food related contents, purchase, and use related

precuts. They benefit from grounds mentioned below.

(1) Customer can easily receive food product and service corresponding to own food profile. Companies
participating in Hintchain provide in the most suitable way set for situation and purpose the customer wants.

Through taste, objective, and history of food profile, minimize unnecessarily wasted time and cost.

(2) If not satisfied with food service recommendation suitable for food profile, customer can search, compare
and decide relevant food product and service through reliable review contents and minimize trial and error.

Food contents community of Hintchain provides reliable reviews through curating of community members.

(3) Customer can be rewarded through updating food profile data, and purchase food product with cheaper
price through this reward. Up until now, marketing companies such as advertisement fee took all consumer

information and did not return the benefit back to customers, but now it is given back as proper reward.
6.2 Food Related Companies

Food related companies include food production, commerce, and O20. They provide food products or
services, and will benefit from grounds mentioned below as core participants of Hintchain paid with cryptocurrency
or legal tender.
(1) Efficient targeting business deployment through food profile is available. By using food profile, companies

can directly provide prepared products to target consumers. Unnecessary marketing cost or distribution cost

can be saved. Also, by sampling partial users of target users, quick product / service test can be deployed.

@)
The Food Protocol Hintchain White Paper

(2) Sensing of overall process of consumer behavior cycle through food profile is available. Aside from fragmentally
understanding consumers through purchase data, overall process of 1) what consumers look for, 2) what
process do they go through to make purchasing decision, 3) what review do they leave after purchase, and
4) what diet pattern they actually form, can be detected through food profile. Furthermore, based on data
insight, relationship building through close communication with community becomes possible through
communication with customers on food contents community or sponsor food reviewer or contents creator.
Understanding consumers and communicating with them based on trust are beneficial for brand strengthening

of food companies.

(3) Fast calculation period of product sales can be secured. Due to the nature of food with short expiry date,

if food companies can secure quick circulation of products, efficiency will increase. Charge of sales process

can be saved as there is no intermediary like payment agency.

7, Partner

All participants of Hintchain contribute in creation of food profile, which is a core operational entry of
ecosystem. Therefore, it is important to secure enterprise participants who can provide data for food profile
creation as ecosystem partner, Partner can be divided by composition data of food profile : 1) Food Meta DB

partner, 2) purchase data partner, 3) behavior / review data partner, and 4) other partners.

7.1 Food Meta DB Partner

Food Meta DB partner refers to partner to reinforce Food Meta DB data, and partner to provide food
engineering / food and nutrition based algorithm. Food Meta DB partner enhances data of existing food, ingredients,
and nutrition, and executes continuous updates by adding newly created data. Companies with food nutrition DB
and ingredients DB, research facilities, food engineering research institute, and data analyst can participate as
food dictionary DB partners. By providing analysis algorithm based on food engineering, they can help processing
accumulated raw data in Food Meta DB to be meaningful data for food profile composition.

- Secure Strategy -

Hintchain supports data accumulation and algorithm research by paying Hint Token for providing data and
algorithm, Also, we will grant access to Food Meta DB to support shared research and development of partners
to accelerate. As Hintchain ecosystem expands, data that Food Meta DB partners can research increases, it will be

a driving force for partners to continuously contribute.

7.2 Behavior / Review Data Partner

Behavior / review data partners will provide behavior / review data that will be base for individual taste
information in food profile. Partners who operate food related community such as service or review/comments
of recipe and restaurant recommendation and food information, and cooking information can participate as
behavior / review data partners, Partners apply Hintchain protocol to own service and provide service space

where customers receive Hint Power as reward from Hintchain.
- Secure Strategy -
Hintchain will secure Haemuk Namnyeo, Misik Namnyeo, and Foodiest as first partners. First step is to apply
food profile and token economy to successfully operate.
At the same time, dAPP will be supported by paying Hint Token to other Hintchain protocol partners already secured.
This cost is designed as ecosystem activation on token metrics. Hint Token payment is not only for initial stage, but
there will be additional payment in future depending on whether Hintchain protocol is continuously updated,

if protocol regulations are complied, and if service is activated, for protocol expansion and activation acceleration.

7.3 Purchase Data Partner

Purchase data partner provides purchase history data that customer's taste continued to actual purchase
on food profile. Purchase data partner is an important partner to provide data to confirm how Hintchain
customers’ food taste and consumption desire are continued to actual purchase.

Distribution and production companies of food ingredient, processed food, and convenience food including
meal kit and HMR can be purchase data partners. Offline commerce enterprises such as coffee shop, bakery,
and restaurants can join as purchase data partners as well. Also, O20 enterprises that connect offline commerce
enterprises with online / mobile can become partners.

- Secure Strategy -

Users of Hintchain are potential purchasing customers to purchase data partners. Relevant partners can secure
delicate target marketing experience through food profile, and increase order conversion rate, repurchase rate, and
long-term Life Time Value (LTV). Instead of inefficient marketing conducted in existing on/offline, food profile based
delicate target marketing and contact service across lifecycle of customers can be provided. So, companies can

reduce marketing and distribution cost, and focuses on providing optimized food product and service to customers.

7.4 Other Partners

Partners who produce or retain food porn, cooking show, and magazines can join Hintchain. They play a role
of uploading contents of good quality to community services participating in ecosystem.
- Inflow Strategy -

Contents provider of good quality can receive Hint Power as reward of contents. A lot of food companies
aiming for differentiated product production and distribution based on food profile are already participating
in Hintchain ecosystem. They can create business model with synergy effect with contents providers.

Hintchain can provide environment for this business deployment.

8, Token Generation Event

Hintchain issues Hint Token (HINT) for Hintchain development and Hintchain based ecosystem creation. Those

who want to sponsor Hintchain can participate in Token Generation Even (TGE) through cryptocurrency transfer,

Token exchange rate applicable for event participants and details of the event will be announced through

official website (hintchain.io).

8.1 Token Allocation Plan

Total number of token issuance is planned to be a billion. 50% of issuance planed token will be provided
to TGE participants. 20% of total issuance to ecosystem participants for ecosystem activation, 10% of total
issuance to Hintchain team that most contributed in ecosystem creation such as Hintchain development and
operation, 5% of total to initial external contributors like advisors, and 15% as reserved token for reserve

fund purpose will be allocated.

Enterprise participants can aim for business efficiency by using solution of Hintchain preferentially through

participating in TGE.

Hard Cap achievement will be decided based on the price of Cryptocurrency at the point of TGE completion.

If Hard Cap is achieved before Main TGE, Main TGE may not be executed.

TGE decides on Hard Cap achievement by cumulative sum of each sale with Cryptocurrency/USD(or USDT)
market price based. If Hard Cap is achieved before Main TGE, Main TGE may not be conducted.

If Soft Cap is not reached, cryptocurrency used for even participation will be returned. If Hard Cap is achieved,
any TGE participation after that point will be restored and cryptocurrency used for participation will be returned
to participants, Soft Cap and Hard Cap will depend on market price volatility of cryptocurrency used in TGE
(Ethereum) and there could be cases of not collecting enough funds or collecting funds more than needed.

To prevent this, Hintchain project will calculate each Soft / Hard Cap in flat currency, USD.

8.2 TGE Participation Process

Hintchain TGE is composed through ERC-20 regulations based Ethereum Smart Contract.

In accordance with this, participants will transfer Ethereum deposited in own electronic wallet to designated
electronic wallet by Hintchain team and later Hint Token will be trasnfered to participants’ own wallet, Participants
will acquire through the method of automatic transfer of Hint Token to above electronic wallet. Other TGE

participation process and method details will be additionally announced to participants through official website.

Secured fund from TGE will be used for Hintchain development and related ecosystem creation. Allocation

of this fund may be adjusted for actual activation of Hintchain protocol in future.
Below is a detailed description of where each funding is used.
8.3.1 Platform Research Development 30%

Hintchain is food profile based Blockchain platform to build food ecosystem, and continuously requires

below 3 platform R&D and technology enhancement.

(1) Research on standardization and structuralization of data
In order to build food profile, a process of standardizing mixed atypical food data is necessary. In other words,
analysis and research of standardizing and structuralizing various data such as food Meta DB like ingredients

and component of food information, personal profile, and log data of eating habit must be continued.

(2) Application algorithm study such as big data based analysis and recommendation

As food taste data is enhanced, analysis and application scope of big data rapidly increases. There are various
big data analysis and algorithm, but algorithm research focused on food field is lacking. Hintchain will apply
existing various algorithm (such as machine learning) to standardized data, test, and build independent

analytic system.
(3) Common platform and API development enhancement
Hintchain, as base protocol platform, will develop various API required by ecosystem participants to enhance

and achieve service / business, and provide as common platform if necessary.
8.3.2 Operation and Commercialization 20%

To operate Hintchain, besides technical operation of the platform, various contributions from participants
of ecosystem operations, users, are needed. We plan to use fund for this participation. In order to achieve business

model proposed by Hintchain with partners, work in grounds mentioned below may be necessary.

- Activation of food profile collection with token economy application
- Business process consultation for Hintchain protocol application to commerce platform

- Legal / financial / business consultation for Hintchain platform and participating partners
8.3.3 Partnership and Base Business Infrastructure Building 20%

To build partnership, certain fund of investment form is required. This is not only used as business deployment
cost necessary to create value chain together with partner, but also needed to build on/offline business
infrastructure required by partners. Hintchain will build food profile based total solution across value chain
through building on / offline infrastructure.

8.3.4 Marketing 20%

For food market, users of existing platform have tendency of not moving easily until feeling certain usefulness.
Therefore, Hintchain must secure above certain level of reliability as new platform, and conduct marketing in
initial market entry state until users can feel usefulness and satisfaction above certain level.

Marketing here does not refer to simple paid advertisement or promotion, but refers to inclusive ecosystem
marketing such as support fund for ecosystem initial participants to make enough viral.

8.3.5 Reserve Fund 10%

In order to be prepared for unexpected variables or business changes, 10% has been secured as reserve fund.

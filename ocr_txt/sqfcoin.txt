Real Estate is the largest asset class in the world with a
combined estimated value of 3.5 times the Global GDP,
ABS TRA CT investing in Real Estate has many advantages over

investing in stocks, bonds or mutual funds. It is also

considered the best way to build wealth over time. The

most notable benefits of investing in Real Estate and Real
Estate-based financial products includes: A predictable cash flow and ability to generate passive
income, an improvable asset with the ability to appreciate, and an array of benefits surrounding
leverage capabilities and mounting tax advantages. However, Real Estate investment transactions
remain frozen in time, conducted in the same manner as they have been since the late 1900’s. Using
outdated and archaic infrastructure, paper-based processes, and multiple third-party intermediaries,
the Real Estate sector has internalized significant structural inefficiencies over time. These
traditional practices create unnecessary friction in transactions, impacting value and liquidity, while
market participants previously had no option but to tolerate the complex regulations and processes
associated with a Real Estate transaction.

SQF Coin aims to connect and combine the modern digital asset economy, the power of Real Estate
and the security of blockchain technology and its benefits. Process driven friction in private markets
present challenges to liquidity, speed, record keeping, accuracy, and market efficiency. In the
traditional Real Estate landscape, investors must deal with the complexities of assets and investor
management, lengthy ownership transfers, regulatory investor compliance, expensive business
operations, maintenance of cash and dividend flow, security against fraudulent transactions, and the
obstacle of liquidity complications. SQF Coin platform provides a comprehensive improvement
solution to each of these areas and more as the future of the digital economy continues to infiltrate
more and more aspects of the world economy.

SQF Coin, an open and decentralized Real Estate marketplace, creates transparency, accessibility and
liquidity for all Real Estate investors in the Globe. Underpinned by blockchain technology, SQF Coin is
a one-of-a-kind investment platform that creates an open fully digital platform accessible Globally,
unlocking Real Estate investment available before only to a selected few. With the introduction of
the fractionalization of the underlying Real Estate asset. SQF Coin aspires to become a worldwide,
interconnected and open Real Estate community.

SQF Coin brings Real Estate investment to the blockchain and aggregates Real Estate online through
three basic functions.

INVESTMENT PLATFORM - Enables fractional
ownership of investment in Real Estate.

DIGITALIZATION - SQF Coin works as an
intermediary between a token-owning individual
and a piece of Real Estate property.

BLOCKCHAIN - Enables ownership interest of the
property by tokenizing it to unique ERC-20 tokens
(“SQF Coin”) on the Ethereum blockchain.

BLOCKCHAIN

Tec h Blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, which

are linked using cryptography. The following statement

Ove rvi ew gives an explanation that summarizes key properties of
the technology: “Blockchain is a method of storage and
synchronization of data between parties who naturally do
not trust each other”. It clearly points out to the most
appropriate applications of blockchain—those that
require guaranteed decision making and ledger
management.

As a starting point, it is critical to understand that there is not just one, but many different
blockchain networks with varying functionality and purposes. Examples include general
programming platforms like Ethereum, which can be used for almost any business or transactional
purpose. To get a better understanding of that structure and blockchain’s value proposition, we
decided to simplify the protocol as much as possible and divide it into its core interacting
technological elements:

- Database

- Peer-to-peer network

- Consensus formation

- Crypto token

- Virtual machine (Ethereum)

Database

The basic component of the technology is the actual immutable blockchain database, which serves
as a back-end office of the blockchain network. The blockchain database synchronizes data between
and amongst multiple users. It can be imagined as a spreadsheet that is regularly updated and
duplicated thousands of times across a network of computers. The actual database consists of data
blocks that are linked to each other. After a certain interval, a new block of data is created and
connected to the previous block. That block includes all historical data plus the new information on
transactions that occurred within that time interval. Blockchain, however, is designed to be an
“append-only” structure. Once it is confirmed on blockchain, all the data is irreversible and
transparent for all users. A user can only add more data, in the form of additional blocks. All previous
data is permanently stored and cannot be altered. For example, if blockchain records a wallet
balance, a new transaction will change the balance that is recorded. However, the pre-transaction
balance also remains on the blockchain permanently. That database can be created in a public
(permission-less) or a private (permissioned) form. Private blockchains behave in the same way as
public ones, except that they require users’ identities to be validated against a list of authorized
members. While public blockchains allow for full transparency, private blockchains ensure that only
parties who have validated their identity to the satisfaction of the administrators are transacting.
Like the evolution of the Internet that began on private Intranets, permissioned blockchains will give
way to the public blockchains if they successfully achieve scalability.

SQF Coin |_|
Peer-to-Peer Network

The next element is the peer-to-peer network on which that database is built on. A peer-to-peer
network is a system where every user is simultaneously a user and a host. That means that there is
no centralized authority that controls who has access. Therefore, blockchain is called a decentralized
network or DAP. Anyone can download a (public) blockchain onto their own computer and become
part of the network by installing an online wallet that functions like a bank account. As a result,
every connected computer on the network has a complete or partial copy. Every transaction on
blockchain is permanently recorded and transparent for all participants, but the individual
participant’s information can only be decrypted through each user’s private key (or digital access
code) making the data secure. In some ways, the rise of blockchain technology can be seen as the
evolution of the peer-to-peer networks from the early 2000s, which were mostly piracy-driven and
ultimately hit a wall as people started to prefer organized and, therefore, centralized architectures.
Thereafter, open peer-to-peer internet networks were replaced by closed single database models
controlled by companies like Facebook or Google with nearly unlimited access to capital. Blockchain
networks have similar open-source peer-to-peer structures. However, blockchain’s token model
creates new ownership models.

Consensus Formation Networks

The third element is the consensus formation algorithm or the process in which the users collectively
come to a decision about what event and when an event occurred that should be recorded in the
data blocks. The current method to reach that consensus is called proof-of-work. It is a probabilistic
solution to address the “Byzantine Generals’ Problem”, which is the problem to reach consensus for
a distributed system that does not have a central authority. In its current format, the connected
network of computers competes with each other to add a new block to the database and get a
reward in the form of the respective cryptocurrency. This prevents any one user from getting too
much power and potentially manipulating the data. This consensus mechanism allows the

blockchain to be a distributed network.

However, the proof-of-work process uses an immense amount of energy due to the raw computing
power necessary to complete each data entry. Therefore, it is not sustainable on the increasingly
large scale that blockchains operate on. As a result, blockchain developers are working on moving to
a process called proof-of-stake, which would pre-determine who gets to add a new block to the
database.

Cryptographic Token

The fourth element is the cryptographic token. We use the term token, rather than cryptocurrency,
to emphasize that the technology is not necessarily aiming to disrupt existing currencies. Much of
the public interest has been directed towards the significance of cryptocurrencies in replacing
traditional currencies, but their primary function is to reward and to incentivize users to keep
building the blockchain network. Cryptocurrencies and tokens are related but separate concepts. All
cryptocurrencies are cryptographic tokens, but not all tokens are cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies
like Bitcoin do not have another use case other than being a medium of exchange, while most of the
blockchain tokens are not meant to be real currencies. A token can be either classified as

SQF Coin |_|

Utility Tokens: represent tokens that provide access to a company's product or service. Utility
tokens are not designed as investments, but only to provide owners with an actual functionality of a
decentralized network. As an Example, FileCoin, raised $257 million by selling tokens that provide
users with access to its decentralized cloud storage platform.

Security Tokens: represent tokens whose value is tied to an outside, tradable asset like equity,
debt, derivatives or Real Estate. These tokens are bought by investors with the anticipation of future
profits.

On a technical level, tokens differ between blockchain ‘native tokens’ - like Ether for Ethereum
blockchain - that are implemented in the core process of blockchain and ‘non-native tokens’. The
native tokens are necessary for blockchain to function, as each exchange that occurs on blockchain is
metered by those tokens. However, there are several different types of tokens even within the same
blockchain platform. These are non-native tokens that sit on top of the blockchain network and are
non-essential. Non-native tokens can represent anything from a salary to an employee badge, to
equity in a blockchain project working on a business application. Therefore, the tokens also differ in
underlying value, utility and legal status.

Ethereum (Virtual Machine)

Ethereum as a digital platform, which allowed for blockchain to become an engine for different
business applications on its own blockchain. This is due to its so-called virtual machine feature that
enables decentralized applications or even fully decentralized autonomous organizations to be built
on top of and powered by blockchain. It is easiest to imagine this as the software combining all the
computing power of the network and its consensus mechanism to allow users to build applications
on top of the protocol layer. Essentially, the blockchain’s protocol powers an application layer that
allows anyone to create and trade their own network token for any blockchain-based business. It
lets users automate any direct interaction between peers or facilitate group interactions across a
network.

These automated transactions are called smart contracts. The key feature of a smart contract is that
it has “programmable” execution; effectively replacing third-party intermediaries. That is, a written
code automatically executes a transaction depending on various conditions, like a computer
function. These smart contracts give blockchain technology the ability to grow beyond a
decentralized database of cryptocurrency transactions and can fuel any type of value transfer. To
visualize blockchain, we created a simplified “sketch” overview below.

REAL ESTATE MARKET OVERVIEW

Situation Overview

Research and surveys from institutions such as the World Economic Forum (WEF), predict that up to
10% of the global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will be stored and transacted with the help of
blockchain technology by 2025-27. Having this tipping point in mind, we ran a market simulation to
determine the potential market size of a global tokenized market using a conservative approach.
Tokens and tokenization can be viewed at four conceptually different levels: The need for
digitization of assets arose alongside the emergence of computing machinery and data transmission
networks. Existing tools for asset management and trading are either not sufficiently automated, not
reliable enough, or require complete trust from users. This greatly limits the potential of market
turnover of goods and services, resulting in an overly low liquidity and interoperability. Before
jumping into details of tokenization, we must clarify the terminology.

Blockchain Enabled Marketplaces
Driving Liquidity

Today, the exchange of Real Estate assets suffers from highly limiting trade restrictions and
illiquidity. In short, there are significant trade frictions starting with sellers and buyers not being able
to find each other. Subsequently, each trade requires a significant amount of underwriting and legal

documentation. Ownership can include various security distinctions that carry significant transfer
prohibitions. Any limited partnership investment, and even the trade of an investment property
deeded to two people, may be considered a regulated security offering, making trade activity highly
manual and costly. To account for the lack of liquidity, the value of private securities is generally
discounted (the “illiquidity discount”), preventing issuers from capturing the full value of the
underlying asset. The tokenization of illiquid assets like Real Estate can potentially reduce trade
frictions. Once these asset- backed tokens are created, a market for trading the tokens could
possibly reduce the estimated 20%-30% illiquidity discount common to many traditional private
securities. Considering only the $13T U.S. Real Estate Market, there is huge potential for Real Estate
investors. The key takeaway is that even just a small decrease of that illiquidity discount achieved via
freely tradeable asset-backed tokens, would potentially represent billions of dollars in unlocked
value.

Real Estate Market

Real Estate market makes up a significant economic global segment both in terms of asset base as
well as transactional activity. The investment market for Real Estate, while immense, has been
dominated by a relatively closed network of firms and organizations able to shoulder big, chunky,
illiquid investments. It is also hindered by a significant amount of transactional friction and opacity.
While there have been improvements in the digital age — especially as it relates to information flow
and transaction set up and completion — we are only at the initial few steps in terms of digitization.
There is still a significant amount of improvement that can be made in Real Estate when it comes to
the use of digital technology and the representation of physical assets in digital forms. This
advancement will be driven largely by the digital securitization of Real Estate properties (also known
as “tokenization”) and improved transaction processing that make it easier to buy and sell properties
and/or shares of properties, and record and perfect property transactions. The future of Real Estate

SQF Coin |_|
13

is one where purchases and investments become much more liquid, much more available, and far
more easily documented and managed. These changes will be driven largely by blockchain
technologies. These technologies include decentralized and immutable transaction ledgers, asset
tokenization, and owner entity and land title registries and, as a result, the benefits will open up
markets for new investors and let a greater number of parties manage ownership, liquidity, and risk
much more effectively.

Potential Benefits of Blockchain Infrastructure to Real Estate.

As previously mentioned, the range and impact of benefits increases as blockchain adoption
becomes more widespread and more supported with updated regulations. The core, or “layer one”,
benefits granted by tokenized securities are marginal in comparison to the benefits of the full
blockchain infrastructure. These benefits also apply to investors, resulting in a better investment
experience, others directly affect the possibility for investors to access new opportunities, customize
in a more granular way their investment portfolio, and an overall reduction on the discount rate.
Access can be improved by lowering the transaction cost, lowering investment minimums, and
allowing international investments. Granular customization is the result of single asset tokenization.
Lower discount rates are the result of lower risk premiums due to greater information transparency,
higher expected liquidity, and improved portfolio management (as a result of granularity).

How Can Blockchain Help Real Estate Operators

Given its size, lack of digital infrastructure, transaction complexities, and illiquidity, the Real Estate
industry stands to greatly benefit from blockchain’s value proposition of helping digitize and
exchange assets in a decentralized and secure manner. Blockchain’s inherent trust mechanism can
be a compelling concept for reshaping businesses and transactions that are traditionally bogged
down by inefficiencies. As such, the $200T+ Real Estate asset class Worldwide- from landlords to
service providers, to data providers and others - needs to pay careful attention to this emerging
technology and develop a strong understanding of the potential changes that could take place in the
market. Blockchain is the technological foundation to create and trade security-law-compliant
representations of traditional private assets. On the SQF Coin platform SQF tokens represent
ownership claims of private securities on blockchain. SQF tokens allow asset owners to easily
convert the rights of individual properties onto the blockchain network, subdivide the asset into
individual parcels and create tradeable fractional ownership of property rights.

SQF Coin |_|

Asset tokenization is an area of explosive growth for the
blockchain industry. Today, blockchain’s application to
securities issuance and trading is well underway, and
the benefits of its application to many types of
securities is becoming better understood. When one
says “blockchain” or “tokenization”, many people tend to think about cryptocurrency and token
sales, which makes headlines almost every day now. But this is only the hype version of the story.

SQF Coin maximizes the strategic value of their assets having already understood the role of
blockchain in achieving security and interoperability of their IT systems.

Once or twice every decade, the IT marketplace experiences a major innovation that shakes the
entire data management infrastructure. In recent years, the emergence of cryptocurrencies
provided an example of how a financial system can be made robust in a completely hostile
environment—fully anonymous, permissionless, distributed, and without any security
administrators, firewalls or physical security. Many ideas can be borrowed from that scenario and
applied to the much more friendly environment of real asset management. The idea of digitization of
all assets and application of programmable logic to the operations with them is very prominent and
is getting more and more traction. Tokenization brings guaranteed trust to the processes in the
accounting system and increases the value of assets.

The two expressions “a tokenized title to an asset” and “a tokenized asset” are to be used
interchangeably.

The Big Idea Behind Tokenization

Tokenization is the process of digital transformation of asset accounting and management systems.
It has nothing to do with the creation of virtual currencies. Tokenized assets are always issued by a
certain business whose role is to perform registration of users, processing of transactions and
custodial services. These activities are performed according to the local regulations. Tokenization
implies that accounts are managed using cryptographic keys, which results in direct account
management instead of mere execution of orders. Tokenization makes accounting systems more
secure than traditional database records which makes them transparent, expandable and scalable.
Tokenization implies that a blockchain based ledger is the primary source of information. For
business, the main benefit is increased liquidity as a result of transaction improvement and
technology advancement. From the IT operations perspective, the main benefit is the reduction of
TCO of the ecosystem and greater interoperability. Tokenization is an evolutionary step in the
transition of accounting from paper to an entirely digital form.

Tokenized Securities

Securities are defined in the U.S. securities law of 1933 passed in the wake of the great market crash
1929. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates and enforces federal securities law in the
US. Additionally, each state has its own securities regulator who enforces securities sold or persons
who sell them within each state.

The term “security” means any note, stock, treasury stock, security future, bond, debenture,
evidence of indebtedness, certificate of interest or participation in any profit sharing agreement,
collateral-trust certificate, preorganization certificate or subscription, transferable share, investment
contract, voting-trust certificate, certificate of deposit for a security, fractional undivided interest in
oil, gas, or other mineral rights, any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege on any security, certificate
of deposit, or group or index of securities (including any interest therein or based on the value
thereof), or any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege entered into on a national securities exchange
relating to foreign currency, or, in general, any interest or instrument commonly known as a
“security”, or any certificate of interest or participation in, temporary or interim certificate for,
receipt for, guarantee of, or warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing.”

Tokens

For our purposes, a token is defined as a blockchain-based, digital representation of an asset. A
token is an accounting unit used to represent user’s balance in a digital accounting system which
allows proving ownership of a corresponding asset.

Tokenization

Tokenization is a process of transformation of asset accounting and management in which the
ownership of an asset is represented by a digital token.

SQF Coin |_|
16

Security Tokens

Security Tokens on the other hand are digital, blockchain-based representations of securities. They
share the same legal constructs as traditional securities but often enable additional technical
features (such as automatic payments, transparent ownership history, and immutable ownership
record) by virtue of being on the blockchain. To date, in the U.S., The Federal Trade Commission
(FTC), IRS, and Security Exchange Commission (SEC), have provided some guidance around the status
of digitally represented assets, but ambiguity remains.

Figure 4 Potential Benefits of Tokenization

Fractionalization

For assets that traditionally have large upfront capital requirements, tokenization lowers the barriers
to entry for investment by enabling interests in the asset to be more readily divided across a wider
pool of investors, democratizing access to the asset. Fractional ownership is securely managed by a
digital register of members on blockchain. New financial products could be distributed to a wider
pool of investors at a lower per unit cost, with a fee structure inclusive of an access premium for the
previously inaccessible investment opportunity.

Customizability

Tokenization enables exposure to individual Real Estate assets. Consequently, instead of investing in
the whole sector, portfolios can be customized down to single buildings.

SQF Coin |_|
17

Liquidity
Tokenization enables liquidity by enabling the secure transfer of shares between investors, with
every transaction reflected on the digital wallets of members. With regulatory regimes worldwide

embracing the technology and establishing frameworks for the regulation of digital securities
exchanges, global public market liquidity for tokenized securities is also well on its way.

Automation

Smart contracts are programmable actions on the blockchain that facilitate the automation of
processes such as compliance checks, investor whitelisting, and post-issuance matters including
paying dividends and distributions. Smart contracts also enable the programming of tokens with
unique qualities, so that characteristics of each share class and customizable fee structures could be
created for tokenized assets at a relatively low operational cost.

Cost Efficiency

By removing certain intermediaries and increasing efficiency of processes, costs in general can be
lowered. This has been the case with many other tech advances as reduction of inefficiencies are
deflationary in nature, consequently resulting in an end consumer that will pay less as the
inefficiencies are removed from the systems.

Settlement Time

Tokens can settle in minutes or hours (depending on the underlying blockchain)

This unlocks the capital that is tied in the market which currently settles at T+3/T+2

Transactions in tokenized products can be settled almost instantly, unlike the days or weeks that it
can sometimes take to settle traditional financial transactions.

Data Transparency

Blockchain as a distributed ledger technology is known for its immutability and resistance to cyber-
attacks, as data is distributed across a network of participating nodes as opposed to a single
centralized database. While transaction information is made trackable and visible on blockchain,
data anonymity of blockchain transactions are preserved by cryptographic hashes. Secure and visible
recordkeeping on blockchain can increase transparency to the underlying data. Especially for
complex derivative products, the ability to clearly link a security to its underlying value.

Structured Products

Additional value can be realized once assets are tokenized, and this process enables the creation of
additional layered financial products such as an array of assets and derivatives. Since the underlying
is tokenized, creating complex products becomes simpler through coded smart contracts.

SQF Coin |_|

Flexibility

The above-mentioned elements enable flexibility in investment: fractionalization enables flexible
portfolio construction and diversification; operational efficiency and reduced settlement time that
allows faster transfer of investment interests; and data transparency brings updated information for
investment analysis in real time.

Why is Security Tokenization Applied to Real Estate?

Some of the current features of Real Estate make it particularly attractive for tokenization. In
general, a single Real Estate transaction is characterized by a large private market investment, in an
opaque data environment. This leads to an investment ecosystem that is rife with slow transaction
and settlement processes that include many intermediaries (agents, sellers, buyers, financers,
insurers, among others), redundant verification processes, and redundant information registered in
isolated databases and registries. SQF Coin not only provide investors with the ability to liquidate
their investments real-time at lower cost (both direct cost and price slippage), but also allows the
investment vehicle to maintain less cash and higher investment rates.

By using SQF Coin, an investor can choose to invest in a specific fraction of a property, on a fixed
portfolio of properties or on a managed portfolio of properties. Some of the potential benefits
particular to this model of Real Estate investing are savings from eliminating intermediaries and the
possibility of investing in specific properties with a high rate of returns allowing the investor to
customize their investment portfolio. An alternative approach to solving the informational and
structural challenges of CRE investment is leveraging blockchain technology to issue a token
representing a financial instrument that invests in Real Estate. To date, the most common procedure
is to tokenize all or a portion of shares in a SPV that owns all or a portion of a property. The shares of
the SPV are held by a custodian who oversees the initial creation of the tokens. Tokens are then sold
to investors (to date, only accredited investors) who in the future would be able to trade them
according to applicable regulations. In this setting, the issuer would have complete transparency as
to the ownership of each token at any point in time. Information, payments, and requests for votes
could be transmitted to all token holders simultaneously through their blockchain address. Investors
would be able to achieve greater diversification and customizability simply by purchasing property-
specific tokens. Issuers could create different tokens for different assets pertaining to Real Estate
investing (ownership of the land, use rights, infrastructure, cash-flows from leases, etc). The issuer
could also create different classes within each type of token, for example, senior tokens on fixed
lease payments and junior tokens for the variable component of commercial leases. The waterfall of
payments can be hard coded into the token’s contracts, providing both a layer of transparency at
creation and compliance and verification upon each payment.

SOF Coin Legally Tokenizing the Property
In order to legally tokenize a property within the SQF Coin
P | atform framework, a short series of steps are required to bridge the gap

between ownership of a distinct real property and the digital
tokens on the Ethereum blockchain that represent that property.

In the SQF Coin platform each property is a discrete property asset. Each property is split into digital
token units based on the square foot measure of that property, or SQF tokens. Ownership of any or
all of the SQF tokens of a particular property gives ownership interest and certain governing rights.
Each of the units of a portfolio is represented by a single unique digital token, or SQF Token, on the
Ethereum blockchain. These digital tokens each have a Unique Identification Number (UIN) that is
found both in the metadata of the token, and in the Certificate of Formation of SQF Coin.

The deed is the legal document showing who owns the real property, for the real property asset
once acquired is held by the General Partner Company. The General partner is the recorded title
holder of the real property. The deed is recorded in the county where the property is located and
thus ownership of the property by the General Partner Company becomes a matter of public record.
Along with the recording of the deed, an affidavit is filed stating that the property listed and
described in the deed is owned by the General Partner Company, which has membership interest
split with its Limited Partner, each with a distinct Universal Identification Number (UIN) and with
each UIN reflected in the affidavit. The affidavit is a redundant mechanism for linking ownership of
the deed to the membership interests of the Partners.

SQF Coin General Partner and Property Management

SQF Coin has its own limited partnership Operating Agreement and each property transacted will be
governed through a General Partnership agreement. The Operating Agreement is an internal
document of SQF Coin that defines the governance and operation of the General Partnership and
SQF Coin (Limited Partner) and the relationships between partners, limited partners and the various
Token holders. The General Partner Company (Solstice Venture Properties) sets the specific terms
and conditions which define the partnership operation in relation to the property and the members
of the partnership, SQF Token holders.

A primary objective of the Partnership Agreement is the significant management of the properties to
be held by the General Partner Company, while sharing ownership rights with the SQF Token
holders. Under the General Partnership Agreement, the authority to manage the day-today
operations of the real property assets owned by the partnership. The purpose of this operating
structure is to limit and shield the responsibility of SQF Token holders with the underlying asset. The
General Partner Company will keep the obligations to give maintenance of assets held, crucial
decisions such as the intent to sell, restore, remodel, or rebuild the property, or deal with any other
unforeseen circumstances that are required. The General Partner Agreement gives quorum to the
General Partner to take decisions and execute on behalf of the Token holders.

Property Management structure

For portfolio properties being held for rent, SQF Token holders are not able to manage the
properties they have an interest in as a traditional landlord. It is unrealistic to expect numerous
token holders from across the world to coordinate complex day to day property management
decisions. A specific type or arrangement is required in order to make the upkeep and rental
collection smooth, so the value of the investment is preserved. Consequently, the General Partner
Company (SVP) is necessary in order to upkeep the property and manage all landlord
responsibilities. The Limited partner, SQF Coin holders, are paid a portion of the rent collected from
the tenant via smart contract obligations built in the blockchain. The General Partner Company
allows for minimum necessary involvement of the SQF Token owners. This management and
ownership structure will ensure and safeguard the future of all units being held in the portfolio. This
careful relationship also ensures that any liabilities arising from the portfolio of properties are not
passed to SQF Token holders.

SQF Tokens are electronic, cryptographic, digital tokens to be
issued as Ethereum-based smart contracts on the Ethereum
Abo ut Blockchain. The protocol, or code, for the SQF Token smart
contracts has been designed based on the open-source ERC-
20 standard. SQF Tokens are effectively a digital membership
SQF To ke n S interest backed by the underlying value of the Real Estate

asset being held. Each SQF Token represents a membership

interest in a particular property made available on the SQF
Coin platform. For each introduced SQF Coin platform property, there will be a limited number of
tokens contained inside the SQF Coin Smart contract that is unique to each portfolio owned
property. While all SQF Coins are equal, they are not fungible. Each SQF Coin has a designated
universal identification number, or UIN, that is required for linking the SQF Coin to ownership of the
membership interest in the Real Estate made available in the platform. The distinct UINs will be
listed in the certificate of formation of SQF Coin, which will be updated and amended to reflect the
acquisition of the SQF Tokens by the token holders in each property and posted on the Ethereum
blockchain. This will allow anyone to search the Ethereum blockchain to identify the Ethereum
digital wallets that own any or all the SQF Token interests in any SQF Coin.

The SQF Token

The governing currency on the SQF Coin platform is the SQF Token. SQF Token is a utility token
designed to enable participants to utilize the decentralized platform. SQF Token will consolidate Real
Estate assets in a global way by connecting Real Estate investment funds and the platform. SQF Coin
embraces decentralization by leveraging the Ethereum blockchain and utilizes smart contracts to
allow investors in the platform to connect in a simple and secure way.

The SQT token is ERC20 compliant token, meaning it follows a common list of rules within the
Ethereum blockchain and is therefore built in the core operating system on the SQF Coin platform.

Investors can transact by interchanging SQF Coins via the SQF Token smart contracts, which will
facilitate access to key functions, namely:

- Creation of new Real Estate listings
- Investment in Real Estate targeted opportunities
- Distribution of Real Estate income

The token is limited by design. Demand for SQF Coins will therefore be driven by the volume of
transactions going through the platform. We anticipate that, as SQF Coin grows and connects more
Real Estate opportunities with the platform, demand for the SQF Coins will increase substantially.
The token will be tradable via crypto exchanges, letting traders and enthusiasts acquire the token
when they are bullish about the success of SQF Coin.

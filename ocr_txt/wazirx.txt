O1 Introduction

© Crytocurrency wallet

There are 44 Million

holders
cryptocurrency wallet

users around the globe. © Global population

Do you realise that they constitute barely 0.6% of the world population? It’s
because there’s a massive obstacle in cryptocurrency’s path towards global

adoption.

Billions of people around the globe are unable to participate in the
cryptocurrency revolution today because of Fiat <> Cryptocurrency conversion
difficulty. People in developing and underdeveloped nations form a huge chunk
of the global population, and face regulatory uncertainty, banking delays and
issues in buying or selling of cryptocurrencies with fiat. Moreover, available fiat

on-ramp options have several issues:

High fiat deposit and/or withdrawal fees
2-5 days to process withdrawal

Custody of fiat funds

The next phase of cryptocurrency adoption happens when the world’s

Fiat <> Cryptocurrency problem is solved for the masses. WazirX will bridge this
global fiat - cryptocurrency gap for the world with our one-of-a-kind solution -

WazirX Peer-to-Peer (P2P).

WazirX has already solved this problem for 1 Billion people!

We launched the world’s first auto-matching P2P engine in India when the
Indian central bank banned banks from dealing with cryptocurrency
businesses, and exchanges started shutting shops. As of today, WazirX P2P is
the go-to method to deposit and withdraw INR in India, and growing steadily.

We don’t plan to stop with India. We'll take P2P to more developing and
underdeveloped countries and provide them with a simple fiat on-ramp

solution that they deserve. What sets us apart:

Instant and auto-matching engine
Low fees
Available 24x7

No custody of fiat funds

We're happy to share that we’re not alone in this mission. WazirX has been
acquired by Binance. It will continue operating as an independent brand of

Binance with a focus on P2P.

In this whitepaper, we'll explain:

The impact of our acquisition
Role of WazirX P2P in the Binance and global cryptocurrency ecosystem

Our product roadmap in detail
This document also introduces WRX, a utility token backed by WazirX, and its
role in the ecosystem. We launched WRX tokens to involve our community in
helping us build out WazirX, and reward them accordingly for contributing to
our success. This helps us stay true to the ethos of cryptocurrency and
blockchain - to share the rewards of WazirX’s success with our early adopters

and supporters.

Introduction to WazirX

We launched WazirX trading platform in March, 2018. The word “Wazir” is
another name for the “queen” piece in chess. It's the strongest piece, and it can
play any move. We launched WazirX initially for Indians, with the aim to provide
the most powerful queen piece of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, a solid

product that offers:

World-class UX
Transparent communication

The most powerful cryptocurrency trading software you deserve

At the time of launch, we distributed WRX tokens to our early users to give
them an opportunity to be part of our success. We want to ensure that when

we list WRX, our community will benefit the most.

WazirxX P2P

Shortly after WazirX launch, the Indian central bank (Reserve Bank of India)

imposed a blanket ban on banks from dealing with cryptocurrency exchanges
and businesses. It was a huge setback for the Indian cryptocurrency industry

with many exchanges shutting shop. Not wavering from our mission, our team

innovated and created WazirX P2P which is the world’s first auto-matching P2P

engine.

Traditionally, peer-to-peer systems are classified listings where you need to go

through the following steps to purchase cryptocurrencies with fiat money:

@ Scroll through each order listing

@ Analyse each order volume, price, and payment method to figure if it aligns

with your requirements

@ Choose multiple orders depending on your trade size

e Figure out the legitimacy of each trader before you deal with them

We call these traditional P2P systems as P2P 1.0 as it’s cumbersome and not

beginner-friendly.

Since its inception, WazirxX P2P has been a game changer in the Indian
cryptocurrency ecosystem. In 2018, when traditional P2P options launched in
India, WazirxX P2P emerged as the top choice for users. Multiple P2P trade
matches happen every minute, and 90% of P2P trades complete within 10

minutes. P2P is growing at a rate of over 9.5% every month.

Total P2P trades: 1.3 Million

Average execution time taken: 15 minutes

We're proud to say that today, WazirX P2P is the cheapest, fastest, simplest and
go-to method for fiat <> cryptocurrency conversion in India. With its
tremendous success in India, we’re confident that WazirX P2P can solve the fiat

<> cryptocurrency conversion problem globally for many more countries.
Smart Token Fund (STF)

At WazirX, our mission is to involve everyone in the blockchain revolution. We

know which token to trade or how to trade. It’s a simplified community-driven
initiative where cryptocurrency enthusiasts can find expert traders, and let
them grow their cryptocurrency portfolio on WazirX. We have an existing
community of pro traders who can trade with the funds of new entrants and in

Acquisition by Binance

After 20 months of building India’s biggest and the most trusted
cryptocurrency exchange, we have been acquired by Binance. Founded by
Changpeng Zhao and Yi He, Binance is the world’s leading cryptocurrency
exchange. Binance’s vision is to increase the freedom of money globally and
significantly improve lives around the world. We at WazirX also share this

mission with Binance.
O02 WazirX Roadmap

With a population of over 1 Billion, the Indian market is a sleeping giant. With our
tried and tested P2P technology, strong product and team, WazirX is already a
market leader in the Indian cryptocurrency ecosystem. On the other hand,
Binance has a massive brand reputation and community presence all around

the world.

WazirX’s acquisition by Binance is another step towards making cryptocurrency
accessible to everyone in the world, and achieving our mission of involving
everyone into the blockchain revolution. Together, we'll be able to maximise
cryptocurrency adoption not only in India, but every developing nation where

fiat on-ramps have to be built.

WazirX will remain an independent brand of Binance. We'll have more resources
and community access to further our cause for cryptocurrency in India and
globally. We'll also take WazirX P2P to more countries and solve the fiat <>

cryptocurrency conversion issue.

WazirX will revolutionise the P2P segment the way

Binance has revolutionised crypto-to-crypto segment.
Phase 1: P2P into Binance Ecosystem

Now that we’re part of the Binance family, we'll be able to tap into Binance’s
user-base and provide them with a fiat on-ramp solution. In Quarter 1 of 2020,
WazirX P2P will be integrated into the Binance fiat gateway. This will allow the

Indian users on Binance to deposit and withdraw INR directly from within the

app.

Next, we'll enable P2P for existing Binance users across multiple countries to
help them deposit and withdraw their respective fiat currencies from within

Binance.

Phase 2: Fiat on-ramps & Partnerships

Fiat on-ramps
We intend to launch fiat on-ramps for multiple developing and underdeveloped

countries where there are regulatory uncertainties and banking delays.
Partnerships

There are several cryptocurrency wallets, exchanges, and DeFi apps
that don’t have a fiat on-ramp. There’s no easy way for such apps
to onboard new users, and this, in turn, obstructs their user growth.
We're confident that WazirX P2P will bridge this gap. We'll partner
with these platforms and integrate WazirX P2P to provide a
seamless on-ramp to these platforms. WRX token has a crucial role

to play in our mission.

O3 Introdution to WRX

WazirX’s native token, WRX is the utility token forming the backbone of the
WazirX ecosystem. WRX token will be based on Binance blockchain. Its total
supply is 1 Billion. The token holders will be rewarded with various benefits on
the trading exchange, and in our future projects - whether or not detailed within

this white paper.

Allocation of WazirX tokens:

% WRX Tokens Where?

10% 100,000,000 IEO Public Sale

5% 50,000,000 Private Sale

30% 300,000,000 Foundation

20% 200,000,000 Product & Marketing
20% 200,000,000 Partnership & Ecosystem
11.10% 11,000,000 WRX Airdrop

3.9% 39,000,000 WRX Mining
WRX Value

Some benefits for WRX token holders include but are not limited to:
50% Trading Fee Discount: We'll offer a 50% trading fee discount to the people
who pay fees using WRX tokens. We plan to run this program for 4 years in the

following manner:

Year 1: 50% trading fee discount
Year 2: 25% trading fee discount
Year 3: 12.5% trading fee discount

Year 4: 6.25% trading fee discount

WRX mining: Users in each country will be able to mine, unlock, and earn WRX

tokens by performing P2P trades

Token airdrop: Applicable when different companies agree to provide tokens to
WazirX users in return for listing on WazirX or as a way to be promoted to all
WazirX users. In such cases, we'll distribute such airdrops based on the amount

of WRX you hold.

Listing fee: There might be fees for listing tokens on WazirX, and you can pay

the same using WRX tokens.

Margin fee: If you do margin trading on WazirX, there may be a fee or interest on

the borrowed amount. You can pay the same using WRX tokens.

Voting power: The token holders will also get the power to vote in listings, or

future feature releases.
WRX Burning Value

Every quarter, we'll burn WRX tokens based on the trading volume on our
crypto-to-crypto platform until we destroy 10% of WRX. We'll eventually burn
100M WRX tokens. As we launch fiat on-ramps to more countries, WRX tokens

will have an integral role to play in the same.

IEO

WRX IEO will be done on Binance Launchpad. Our token sale on Binance
Launchpad will not only help us expand P2P to more countries faster, but also
give us further access to resources and support from across the Binance

ecosystem.

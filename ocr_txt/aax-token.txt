Executive Summary

As the crypto industry strides forward across technology, utility and regulation, the role of
exchanges is vital in driving traction and participation.

AAX has raised the standards for integrity, security, and performance, delivering a trusted
environment for retail and institutional investors alike - establishing a next generation digital
assets exchange where crypto meets global finance.

Powered by London Stock Exchange Group’s LSEG Technology, AAX offers spot, futures and
over-the-counter trading across 50+ crypto-to-crypto pairs, perpetual contracts, and fiat on
and off ramps.

Over the coming months we will roll out new financial products that offer unique ways of
engaging crypto and crossover markets, and AAX’s native exchange token, AAB, will provide
access to these markets, and enable token holders to take part in the growth of the industry.

Serving as a bridge between crypto and global finance, AAB is a form of digital umami that
brings that hard-to-define, but distinct extra dimension to trading with AAX. The token offers:

= A multi-tiered discount scheme

Settling trading fees with AAB is rewarded with a 20% discount, and a further discount is
granted in proportion to how much AAB clients hold relative to their overall portfolio.

= Optimized wealth management

AAB will be used in special promotions that make lending, borrowing, staking, and saving,
even more attractive.

= Platform upgrades

AAB can be used to unlock exclusive services and facilities, trading bots and trading signals,
and other premium offerings.

» Pioneer program

AAB will be the key token to gain access to AAX’s pioneering financial products and
programs, including index derivatives, tokenized commodities, security tokens, and social
trading schemes.

A total of 50 million AAB will be gradually released to the market, with 20% made available for
public sale in a series of discounted flash sale rounds.

To purchase AAB at a discount, traders will have to subscribe. Over the course of two rounds,
starting from the 14th of April, 2020, 1 million AAB will be offered at a 50% discount. Based on
a lucky draw, half of all buyers will get their deposits back and keep their AAB for free.

Join us in our journey to unlock the potential of digital assets.
An Institutional-Grade Platform,
For Everyone

Gearing up for Mass Adoption

It was right after Bitcoin reached its all-time high, with the onset of
the ‘crypto winter’, that we saw an opportunity.

We observed that the crypto industry was passing its adolescent
phase and heading into maturity. This would manifest itself in
greater participation in the markets, not just from retail, but also
from institutional investors.

The fall of Bitcoin, in 2018, would give rise to a next generation of
crypto exchange, and the comeback of crypto would usher in a new
age for finance, changing the way value is generated and shared, for
everyone.

We saw a future where tokenization would give rise to a full spectrum
of digital assets, connecting crypto with global markets, allowing for
a borderless flow of capital across economies.

Crypto Market Gold Market
$800 billion (2017) $8 trilion

But we cannot take such progress for granted.

Issues around security, lack of transparency, technology, market
manipulation, pose serious obstacles to growth.

If institutional players don’t trust us, they won’t trade with us.

This is why we've built an exchange that raises the standards for
integrity, security and performance; one that stands up to
regulatory scrutiny, is accessible to the masses, and fulfills the
requirements of institutional market participants as well.

Such an exchange would be able to offer the same degree of
professionalism and sophistication displayed by the world’s major
capital markets.

From Billions to Trillions

Crypto’s $800 billion dollar market cap at the end of 2017 was an
impressive achievement, but it gave only a glimpse of what’s
possible.

What happens when tokenization allows this industry to tap into the
$8 trillion dollar gold market, or the world’s $80 trillion dollar stock
markets? The type of growth we’re looking at as an industry should
not be underestimated.

Stock Market
$80 trilion

Over the past few years, crypto exchanges have done incredibly
important work around market infrastructure and channeling capital
into the industry, but now, as we approach the emergence of more
crypto markets, crossover markets and alternative forms of engaging
global finance, exchanges will need to step up their game.

and institutional investors, we operate spot,

utures and over-the-counter markets across 50+ crypto spot pairs,

iat-to-crypto on and off ramps.

This year, 2020, we are launching our native exchange token AAB -
built to serve as a bridge between crypto and global finance.

To further attrac

capital into the digital asset world, we will roll

out a set of unique financial instruments, and expand on tokenized
commodities, perpetual contracts, options, indices, altcoins and

security tokens.

Building the Exchange of Choice

In our technology strategy, we settle for nothing but the best.

We've developed a proprietary wallet system which uniquely enables
investors to trade across spot, futures and over-the-counter markets,
drawing from one single balance.

We've also adopted well-established, proven technologies, such as
LSEG Technology. It is this blending of systems that runs through our
entire technology stack. It is what makes AAX the strongest, fastest,
and most reliable exchange in the industry to date.
LSEG Technology is delighted

to have successfully deployed

our world class matching engine
capabilities at AAX. This is the first
time that Millennium Exchange
has been deployed in the cloud,
bringing its scalability, flexibility,
reliability and seamless direct
market access to AAX.

Ann Neidenbach
ClO, LSEG Technology

Pioneering Performance

AAX is powered by LSEG Technology’s Millennium Exchange
matching engine. This is the same matching engine that is at the
heart of London Stock Exchange, Oslo Stock Exchange, and Borsa
Italiana.

Upgraded to operate 24/7 and facilitate digitals assets trading,
this proven technology is capable of handling institutional
volumes with ultra-low latency.

In our current setup, orders are executed with latencies as low

as 90 microseconds and sub-millisecond averages. When the
need is there, the matching engine can be reconfigured, enabling
AAX to perform on equal footing with the world’s top 10 capital
markets in terms of speed and sophistication.

GOms — <900 ms

Ultra Low Latency Average process time per order

AAX is also a pioneer by virtue of being the first to ever deploy
Millennium Exchange in a cloud computing environment.
Operating our platform on Amazon Web Services, rather than in
a dedicated data centre, gives us maximum uptime, commercial
flexibility and recoverability.

Security Is Always Top Of Mind

To offer the highest level of security to our clients, AAX has
worked closely together with Kroll, a leading global provider
of risk solutions that has advised governments, intelligence
agencies and financial institutions for over 45 years.

AAX is compliant with CCSS, a wid

authorization systems, AAX also implements a stringent multi-
level employee verification system in compliance with CCSS as
well as relevant data protection and privacy ordinances.
Integrity Pays Off, a Thousand-fold

In traditional financial markets, clean capital, transparency and
fairness are taken for granted. This may not always be true for
cryptocurrency exchanges.

Part of the work needed to change this entails implementing
best practices gleaned from regulated markets. It also requires
some bespoke measures that take into account blockchain’s
unique features.

To ensure a high degree of market integrity, key measures
include:

thorough identity verification procedures
specialized market surveillance
Articulation of a shared set of rules
Proper infrastructure

Education

Having a clean pool of liquidity starts with having thorough

Furthermore, Elliptic supports AAX in monitoring on-chain
capital flows to keep the exchange in check with the latest
regulations.

ntegrity also rests on the underlying systems. Our matching
engine, Millennium Exchange, is MiFID Il compliant. It supports
he work of offering a level playing field.

We also believe that all investors, retail and institutional,
deserve fair markets, where prices are real and volumes are
real. To this end, we are partnered with Solidus Labs to provide
state of the art market surveillance. This helps to ensure
that our market is free from wash trading and abnormal price
movements; ensuring that all of our clients’ trading activities
are protected.

Other measures we've taken include the implementation
of robust pre-trade risk checks, as well as proper auto-
liquidation mechanisms in our futures markets.

The Key to Growth is Trust

Together, performance, security and integrity are what make our
exchange trustworthy. This is not only an attractive factor for
retail traders but also a decisive one for institutional investors.

To that end, AAX is the first crypto exchange to ever join London
Stock Exchange Group’s trusted ‘Partner Platform’. This
purpose-built network enables AAX to expand its services and
reach institutional clients throughout Europe, North America and
Asia.

t offers LSEG’s connected client community of 800+ investment
irms, sell-side brokerages, and data and technology vendors,

he ability to access AAX directly, simplifying and accelerating the
institutional on-boarding process.

Our goal? To open the crypto markets up to the far greater, far
deeper pools of liquidity that hedge funds, family offices, pension
funds, and other institutional investors can bring to the table,
and turn a billion dollar, to a trillion dollar industry.
Building Products Without Limitations

Our Live Products

We are constantly on the lookout for top-quality cryptocurrencies,
and now already offer more than 50 crypto-to-crypto trading pairs.

AAX also offers perpetual futures contracts for major cryptocurrency
pairs with BTC and USDT as the primary settlement currencies.
Contracts can be traded with up to 100x leverage, with sophisticated
auto-liquidation mechanisms and an Insurance Fund in place to
protect market participants.

Lastly, we make it as easy as possible for new investors to purchase
and sell crypto for fiat. Our over-the-counter platform hosts
institutional-grade liquidity providers, offering a simple way for our
clients to move in and out of crypto.

Where Crypto Meets Global Finance

In anticipation of a maturing and expanding market, AAX has plans in
place to develop and list innovative financial instruments and digital
assets. The goal is not just to develop new ways of engaging the
crypto markets, but also to integrate crypto with existing markets.

This includes the creation of special indices, but also listing tokenized
commodities enabling investors to trade Bitcoin against, say, oil, gold,
coffee, or even salmon. Here’s what’s coming:

As we roll out these new features and products, AAB will provide
access to new markets and will enable token holders share in the
growth of the exchange.
AAX Token (AAB)

More than a token, AAB is an integral part of AAX, providing special benefits to
users, and a means to be part of the growth of the exchange.

It is built to serve as a bridge between digital and traditional assets, retail and
professional traders, takers and market makers, the exchange and its partners,
and it will be deeply integrated with AAX’s upcoming products expansion.

We like to think of AAB as digital umami - it adds that extra touch, that next-level
flavor, that hard-to-define dimension - the missing piece that makes everything
taste slightly better.

In total, 50 million AAB is to be issued as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum
blockchain, and it willinitially be valued at 1 USDT each.
AAB: Utility & Access

Multi-tiered Discount Scheme

AAB is the primary currency for settling up to
100% of all trading fees on AAX.

Baseline Discount
Trading fees settled in AAB are discounted at 20%

Porfolio Discount

For any percentage of a client’s portfolio allocated
to AAB, a corresponding percentage is added to
the client’s overall discount, up toa maximum
discount of 50%

Clients can opt out of using AAB to settle

their trading fees

i. Opting out means forfeiting the ‘Baseline
Discount’;

ii, Clients can still enjoy the ‘Portfolio Discount’
up to amaximum of 50%

Optimized Wealth Management

AAB will be used to drive promotions across
lending, borrowing, and other features.

Lending
Adding 10% of AAB on top of the total loan
collateral, will be rewarded with 1% extra interest
on the total loan collateral

Borrowing
Clients who opt in to pay interest on loans with
AAB will enjoy a 20% discount

Platform Upgrades

Clients can use AAB to unlock special features and
tools to optimize the trading experience;

Use AAB to unlock trading bots and trading
signals

AAB can be used to gain access to exclusive
services and facilities, including increased API
access rates, and FIX connectivity.

Clients who hold more than 100,000 USD worth of
AAB can enjoy:

i. Higher withdrawal and internal transfer limits;

ii. Early notifications around product upgrades,
events, and promotions;

iii. Discounted custody services

Pioneer Program

AAB can be used to purchase social trading
subscriptions to copytrade high-performing
traders, as well as low-performing that can be
copied in the reverse, with leverage;

AAB is the only trading fee payment currency for
engaging unique financial instruments, including
index derivatives, a selection of tokenized
commodities, and security tokens.

Daily Coinburns

Built for aggressive price action, AAB will benefit from daily buybacks and
coinburns funded by 100% of all trading fees earned by AAX on its futures
markets. Any AAB bought back from the market will be permanently destroyed
and auditable on the blockchain. This process will continue until 50% of the total
supply of AAB is destroyed.

To give an idea of what this implies:

AAX currently ranks 39th on contractmarketcap.com, between ErisX (51st) and
Bakkt (36th). If we take the top 10 crypto derivatives exchanges by daily trade
volume, we can see that daily volumes range between $1bn and $11.5bn on
average.

Even if AAX were to secure a place at the lower end of the top 10, generating
between $1bn to $3.5bn a day, with maker and taker fees averaging out to 0.05%,
AAX’s buybacks and coinburns would still mean the destruction of $250k to
$875k worth of AAB per day.

With AAX, we expect to generate $500m daily trade volumes by the end of

2020, break into the top 10 in 2021, with an average volume of $1.5bn, and then
onwards to $4.5bn in 2022. There is no doubt that AAX’s daily buyburns will
stimulate significant price action and present token holders with an opportunity
to grow with AAX.

warranties, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose (except only to the
extent prohibited under applicable law with any legally required warranty period to
the shorter of thirty days from first use or the minimum period required). Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company does not warrant that the subscription
process for AAX Token will be uninterrupted or error-free.

You acknowledge and agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by any Applicable
Laws, the disclaimers of liability contained herein apply to any and all damages or
injury whatsoever caused by or related to use of, or inability to use AAB or the use

of or inability to use, or purchase of, or inability to subscribe to AAB, or arising out

of any interaction with the smart contract implemented in relation to AAB.

nature, potential value, suitability, and appropriateness of any risks related to the

including but not limited to restrictions on the use or possession of AAB whic
could impede or limit their existence, permissibility of their use and possession
and their value. This may result in registration or licensing requirements for AAB

such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory
approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.

services within the platform or the Company itself will be made by the Company at

utility of any AAX Token you own, including their utility for obtaining services.

Any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of the Ethereum protocol may have
a material adverse effect on AAB. Moreover, advances in cryptography, or technical
advances such as the development of quantum computing, could present risks to

the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins the Ethereum protocol;

such exchanges may be relatively new and subject to little or no regulatory
oversight, making them more susceptible to fraud or manipulation. Furthermore,
any external exchange value ascribed to AAB by third parties, denominated ina
digital or fiat currency, may be extremely volatile which may result in the potential
for permanent and total loss of value of the AAX Token, should the market for AAX
Token disappear.

measures on the AAX Platform and AAX Wallet, AAX Token may still be the target
of malicious cyberattacks or may contain exploitable flaws in its underlying code,
which may result in security breaches and the loss or theft of AAX Token. The
Company can provide no assurances that the creating, transfer or storage of AAX
Token will be uninterrupted or fully secure.

unanticipated risks associated with your subscription, possession and use of AAB
may materialize such as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks
discussed in these Terms and the Whitepaper.

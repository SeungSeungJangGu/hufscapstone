Abstract

The current state of the cryptocurrency market comprises numerous participants viz. Investors, traders,
lenders, borrowers, and arbitrageurs among others. They exchange hands to the tune of billion dollars
worth of digital assets in custodial & non-custodial markets.

Niche markets like decentralized finance, popularly known as DeFi, have presented users with limitless
opportunities and a plethora of choices. The advent of open finance enabled by millions of lines of code
has the potential to self regulate, design new regulation, build community governed regulatory
approaches across the otherwise most centrally regulated industry in the modern world. It has the
potential to empower a billion lives with better access to financial products of choice.

DeFi protocols & products have evolved over the incumbent ethereum blockchain and are ready for
expansion. While the inherent problems of the ethereum network are a great barrier to adoption &
scalability, there's a dire need to instill sophistication in the existing digital assets markets to elevate it
to a level at par with traditional markets. Market participants lack imagination when it comes to trading
the time value of assets. Incentives in the form of interest rates derive motivation for the deployment of
unutilized assets. The efficient utilization of time value of assets leads to wealth creation in markets
whilst value transfer between participants who seek (borrower) and who gives (lender).

Presently, most digital assets are mispriced and carry high volatility over a longer time frame. Hence,
holding digital assets with depleting principal value is demotivating. Therefore, users seek new
incentives & frameworks to offset the losses and cope up with higher transaction costs and complexity.

In this paper, we introduce a decentralized system for the frictionless borrowing of digital assets on
layer 2 networks to tackle the shortcomings of existing systems, making money markets efficient, and

creating higher-yield bearing opportunities.
Introduction

EasyFi is a universal layer 2 lending protocol built for DeFi focused on scalability, composability, and
adoption. It has been designed as an open network infrastructure to run on public networks to facilitate
an end to end lending & borrowing of digital assets and related financial products.

Freedom to create new financial products and customize existing ones paves the way for permissionless
innovation. ‘Proof of Reputation’ contracts establish creditworthiness and promote greater efficiency
and transparency for better lending & borrowing opportunities. Non-custodial contracts allow seamless
on-chain & off-chain transactions of digital assets across markets and participants while retaining
custody with the original owner.

The network design is ethereum compatible and blockchain agnostic allowing instant settlement of
assets over different blockchain networks while retaining custody with the asset owner's network. The
cross-chain framework allows lending & borrowing across a spectrum of global markets including
private platforms and permissionless public networks. The network is secured by proof of stake
mechanism, governed through participating voters to achieve consensus among network participants.

We believe this technology can be transformational for the lending ecosystem while retaining higher
efficiency, lower transaction costs, lower dependency & greater transparency.
Problems & Motivation

01. High cost & slow speed of transactions

02

03

04

The incumbent ethereum network is a vast ecosystem that offers great resources and eases to
build. But it comes at a cost which is increasing by the day. High gas fees or transaction costs are
a huge barrier to mass adoption and scalability. Latency, low throughput, higher block completion
time makes network accessibility difficult. Provided the magnanimous challenge ethereum faces,
currently, it is therefore important to build alternatives and curtail dependency.

High collateralization ratio

Currently, most DeFi users need to lock 150-200% of assets to avail loans which are predominantly
used for trading and accessing leverage across different protocols. While it adds to the cost of a
loan, it also presents a great barrier to market expansion. Lately, new mechanisms like credit
delegation, flash loans have tried to solve the problem but they are still evolving. We believed under
collateralized and uncollateralized lending is critical for mass adoption.

Lack of Smart financial products

Traditional financial markets offer many choices and a wide range of products to choose from.
Although, these are more easily accessible by institutions than retail users. So users have to
subscribe and use what is being offered by institutions. Mutual funds, Fixed deposits, term deposits,
insurance, bonds, securities are pushed to market while DeFi has turned the tables. DeFi has not
only empowered developers to create and sell such financial products, it has given a voice to users
to demand products of their own choice and suitability. But currently, we understand that there's a
dearth of smart and sophisticated financial products in the decentralized finance market.
Therefore, we believe, new financial products with more real-life use cases need to be created and
made more accessible through decentralized finance.

Also, it is inevitable to ignore the pace at which the size of the decentralized market is expanding.
The primary reason for the same is the influx of institutional and HNI's/UHNI's capital to markets.
Important to ask if we have offerings and products to suit the needs of these institutions? We
believe DeFi lacks the same and therefore, needs more sophisticated financial products so as to
sustain such market size.

Absence of credibility benchmarks

Identity mapping to the borrowers and their track record is still disconnected from borrowing
transactions, collateral-free or low collateralized loans are a distant dream. A_ higher
collateralization ratio is also linked to a lack of trust in a multi-party agreement. DeFi lacks such a
mechanism so as to measure and benchmark the creditworthiness of a user in a scientific way.
Higher collateral is a cushion to volatility and mitigates the risk of liquidation events too. But this
brings inefficiency and lack of transparency in the market. The absence of credibility benchmarks
is a great hindrance to the development of newer financial products and the ability of institutions
to lend in a more decentralized way. Interest efficiencies and higher costs of operations only add
to the list of problems.
Proposed solution

01. Porting necessary infrastructure to Layer 2 Blockchain networks

02

Layer 2 scaling techniques move transactions off-chains and bundle them into proofs that are
submitted back to the main chain. Layer 2 solutions provide better speed and low cost of
transactions. These optimized networks are ethereum compatible and are customizable to a great
extent. Therefore, offering the necessary flexibility to operate in a niche while constantly being
connected to the main ethereum network too.

There are numerous layer 2 solutions that solve the problem of scalability and high transaction
cost but needs refinement and deployment. EasyFi Network protocol is designed as a layer-2
agnostic solution to provide an agile exchange of assets across numerous layer 2 networks in a
plug & play mode and switching in between on-chain off-chain storage as and when necessary.

Existing Layer 2 solutions

L2 scaling solutions are categorized into

A. State channels
B. Sidechains

It is assumed that every network participant on a state channel acts as a validator which is a fixed
set while anyone can use the network on a side chain and has a very separate validator set.

Sidechains are further classified into custodial and non-custodial sidechains. On a custodial
sidechain, assets are moved to a parallel chain with their own consensus mechanism and security
whereas non-custodial sidechain assets are secured on the main chain through smart contracts.

One of the frameworks to build non-custodial side chains is called Plasma. The major advantage
with plasma is that it allows the derivation of security through mainchain (Ethereum) which is not
the case with all non-custodial sidechains. Plasma allows enforcement of block headers onto the
main chain which is basically snapshots of balances at a certain point of time, bundled as a single
transaction. These transactions are bundled into a Merkle tree and root hash is generated while
submission on the main chain.

On a plasma chain, validators stake for the right to validate plasma blocks. Only chosen or
designated validators can validate, making it primarily a proof of stake chain. Plasma, therefore,
allows off-chain transactions at a much higher and cheaper rate. The single operator model can
be used in Plasma with a requisite fraud-proof mechanism which enables the optimistic execution
of transactions on the sidechain.

Optimistic Rollups are also non-custodial side chains that include enough data in blocks for
everyone to reconstruct and challenge their state thereby solving the data availability problem of
Plasma but are prone to the scalability problem of the mainchain (ethereum) itself. ZK-Rollups
have architecture very similar to ORs, but fraud proofs are replaced by validity proofs. These
validity proofs are expensive to compute therefore costs higher fees.
To understand the comparison and deep dive technically into L2 s, please refer to the following table:

In conclusion, Plasma, we believe, is the best available L2 solution because of inherent properties as

discussed, while ORs & Zk-Rollups are a great improvement in the direction and we are open to keep
exploring the same until we can see a real-world production-grade implementation.
03. Undercolletralization & Borrower's evaluation

Enforcing something financially which isn't financially backed is a great challenge. To mitigate the
risks involved one of the approaches could be to shift the burden to a better-suited entity. A third
party that can't guarantee repayment in case of default. It can be termed as a process of social
fund recovery where the borrower's guarantee is taken by a certain individual who is ready to back
the event. Since anonymity and privacy have been core or decentralized finance it would be
counterproductive and tough to find such backing. Therefore, the guarantor approach won't be
best suited.

Another approach that can be taken from traditional financial markets is replicating credit score
mechanisms. Legacy finance has been utilizing credit evaluation techniques through consortiums
which created and maintains a centralized database for assessing borrower's credibility. Historical
data of users is collected, collated, stored, and analyzed on the basis of preset parameters to suit
the satisfaction of lending entities. These lending entities feed tons of data to the centralized
engine which, over time, becomes invaluable for credit risk management. Of course, there are
shortfalls to this approach as we have witnessed leakages, misuse, and exploitation of user's data
by key centralized institutions and sovereign entities. But using the right mechanisms, since we
enjoy the liberty of distributed databases and peer to peer interaction in a decentralized world, we
believe, we can create such a system so as to assess borrower's creditworthiness while addressing

the shortcomings.

Therefore, we wanted to use a system that doesn't allow for censorship beyond lending and where
users are in complete choice and full control of their data while preserving the privacy & degree of
anonymity too. Tough task! Huh. we explored much but got to understand that the identity layer
problem is not easier to solve. Finally, we ended up creating our own identity layer protocol called
TrustScore that helps solve the dilemma. Using TrustScore users can whitelist an ERC20 address
and Trustscore's proprietary algorithms create metrics that help establish borrowers (read user's)
creditworthiness over a period of time. Trustscore scans user's activity on various lending
platforms and protocols to assess credit behavior only through that whitelisted ERC20 address.
Users have a choice to add as many whitelisted addresses as they want. The algorithm intends to
gather only related financial information of users required to establish a certain behavior and
non-financial reputation would be uncensorable even in case the user is at default.

Using the system, as explained above, Easyfi intends to solve the problem of over-collateralization
and identity layer (up to some extent) in the decentralized finance ecosystem. A separate paper
detailing the mechanism shall be released in the near future too.

04. Smart Products

As mentioned above, for retail users, lending markets need to offer products that can be utilized
beyond trading. Therefore, we intend to offer such financial products that have a direct impact on
the user's real life. As our first offering, we planned to launch products under the microlending
category. Microlending allows borrowers access to time-bound loans of small values at much lesser
interest rates than traditional banking & lending markets. These loans would be able to be drawn
directly to their wallets and can be used for various purposes. Microlending products have a huge
use case for small businessmen too for meeting their day to day working capital requirements.
Lending markets, predominantly, in decentralized finance have been catering to borrower's
requirement of funds for trading purposes. Recently, we have witnessed, a huge influx of
institutional capital into various protocols and platforms. We believe institutions have finally
retained confidence in the code and are deploying their ideal funds in lieu of better interest
earnings. This calls for institutional-grade products and offerings required to meet the dynamics of
smart capital. Easyfi has plans to introduce insurance in DeFi through credit default swaps as the
first in a series of financial derivative instruments. More detailed information pertaining to design,
architecture, deployment, etc. shall be made public through subsequent papers.

Needless to mention the role of undercolletralization, credit delegation like mechanisms in
designing such financial products is of great importance. We'll release detailed information on
different products and related concepts in subsequent papers.

Unique Selling Proposition

Existing money market protocols have been successful in creating & aggregating much-needed
liquidity to the existing market. The supply side is overwhelmed with excessive capital which
remains unutilized due to the weaker borrowing side. This demand gap has lead to a tipping point
where it is now necessary to focus on demand generation by offering more appealing financial
products in insurance, microlending among others to borrowers.

Therefore, EasyFi aims at bridging the gap among borrowers and sellers while addressing the
technological limitations of the existing network.

Core concepts

01. Supplying Assets

02

03

Users supply an asset to their respective liquidity pool where aggregated liquidity is matched to
the borrower's demand thereby creating fungibility of the resource pool. Utilization Ratio U
describes the ratio of total assets borrowed from respective liquidity pools against assets supplied.
Unless otherwise utilized to full capacity, users can withdraw their assets at any time. Assets in
respective pools are represented by ERC-20 Token ‘eToken’. Asset suppliers hold eTokens of a
proportionate amount which represents the user's proportionate contribution in the pool and
entitled for interest earned from the money market over a period of time. The accumulated
eTokens are convertible to underlying assets thereby accruing interest, as a function of borrowing
demand, by simply holding ‘eToken’.

Utilization ratio U, for each market a unifies supply and demand as:

Uc=Borrows./(Cashat+Borrowsa)

Borrowing Assets

‘eToken’ holders by using the same as collateral can borrow from EasyFi money market protocol
and other integrated protocols in the ecosystem, seamlessly. Users can specify the asset to be
borrowed without getting into the hassle of negotiating terms and conditions but with desired
parameters, so set by market forces. Transparency and uniformity make the money market unique
in its approach for all network participants.

Collateral Value

Each market has a collateral factor 0 to 1, representing a portion of the underlying asset that can
be borrowed. Lower collateral factors interpret illiquid market and higher collateral factors
represent high liquidity in the respective market.

The user's borrowing capacity is calculated by multiplying collateral factors by the sum value of
accounts with underlying assets.

For example, the Borrowing capacity ( for the corresponding market) Be of user account A with x
amount of USDT, collateral factor 0.67 of the market a is calculated as follows:

B,” = ,USDT * (0.67),

In simple terms, as

Borrowing capacity = (Value of token balance) * (Collateral Factor)
04.

05.

06.

Interest Rate Model

Governance can decide the interest rate model and is codified through a demand curve which is
expressed as a function of utilization ratio, as calculated above, base interest rate, and reserve
ratio. Therefore, the Borrowing Interest rate of the market a can be calculated as follows:

Borrowing Interest ratea = Base rate +U. * Reserve ratea

The supply interest rate for the market a is derived through borrowing interest rate, reserve factor,
and the total amount of borrowers or total spread S in the respective market as followed:

Supply Interest rate. = Borrowing Interest rate, * Ua * (1-S)a

Exchange Rate

User's balances are expressed in proportion or amount of eToken balances for each activity
conducted in the protocol. Users can redeem, mint, borrow, repay limited to their balance of
eTokens with accrued principal and interest which can be exchanged with underlying market
assets using exchange rate (Price of eToken for the underlying asset). It is calculated as follows:

underlying balance + total borrow balance, -reservesa
Exchange rate (¢) =_§=— AAA

eTokenSupplya

Interest Rate Index

As the market forces namely demand and supply changes in a market, the interest rate is
calculated and applied to all borrowers uniformly which adjusts over time. This change is regularly
captured and represented as an Interest Rate Index for each time the transaction is done in the
protocol. It is calculated per block interest rate, denominated by r* t as follows:

Indexan = Indexa,(n-1) * (1+ r*t)

07. Liquidity pools

Under existing standard mechanisms borrowers are matched with lenders. These borrowers pay an
interest fee for seeking assets and lenders are rewarded for providing liquidity to the market. The
cost incurred to borrowers is incentivized to lenders therefore acting as economic incentives to
maintain liquidity in the market. Therefore, they act as operators of the money market which
provides sufficient depth to the liquidity pools.

09.

Undercollateralized Lending

Optimum collateral requirements are important to motivate borrowers to enter the market. Over
collateralization is a barrier to entry albeit it's important to mitigate market risks that arise from
volatility and subsequent liquidation. Traditional financial markets have appropriate credibility
assessment measures and corresponding facilitating institutions in place to establish the
creditworthiness of a user. Consequently, they instill sufficient trust in the system to facilitate
lending & borrowing by mitigating intrinsic risks of default or non-payment.

Defi lacks such standard benchmarking mechanisms due to a lack of access to data pertaining to
users. This calls for maintaining user data over a period of time to build creditworthiness and
record any defaults or non-payment by the borrower. But there's another pressing concern of
privacy and data security of users. Therefore, it is pertinent to follow a novel and balanced
approach so as to establish creditworthiness, data verification, and maintain appropriate privacy

at the same time.

Micro Lending

Peer to peer financing has witnessed huge growth in digital assets markets and we have seen
impressive advancements in the sector leveraging p2p applications. One of the major use cases of
peer to peer financing is microlending. But Defi has still to offer microlending as a service to its
users. Microlending enables the deployment of funds to real-world use cases and derives better
value economies. Creditworthiness helps establish trust in multi-party agreements and allows
uncollateralized lending through a shared pool and credit delegation to a seeker of choice.

EasyFi intends to facilitate lenders offering undercollateralized loans of smaller value to borrowers.
Inherent risks of credit default and non-payment are shared by existing lenders in a proportionate
manner. Lenders here provide liquidity to pools meant for portfolios of many dozens of
microloans. By spreading the risk across a large number of lenders it is ensured that the whole
portfolio is not wiped out and loss is shared. This facilitates the expansion of lending markets to
new dimensions that DeFi has yet to witness.

10. Credit Delegation

Alternative methods like peer to peer financing enable users to obtain loans from other users
directly, cutting through the middleman. The most important factor that defines a relationship is
“Know your borrower" which means the lender knows to whom he is lending. Thereby taking the
burden of risk that may arise in the event of default. But in decentralized finance, as discussed
above under the heading ‘borrowers evaluation’, in absence of an identity layer the only resort left
to lenders is to mitigate the primary risk of default through some mechanism. Here, the Credit
delegation plays a vital role which is a programmed or coded version of bi party agreement
between lender and seeker. Both parties can enter into a trusted agreement in which the lender's
capital can be borrowed by the seeker. All important clauses and conditions perse Interest rates,
loan terms, and other covenants are set into an Open Law agreement and stored, providing an
immutable point of reference. While credit delegation offers a degree of under collateralization,
combined with creditworthiness ( TrustScore) can be translated to uncollateralized lending in the
future.

11
11. Smart financial products

12.

13

14

Smart contracts have the capability to create, design, and offer a wide range of custom financial
products using different protocols or platforms. These smart contracts are written at a higher level
of thoughtfulness for better testing, analytical capabilities. They can further be integrated to create
more innovative and high yield-bearing products like credit swaps, default swaps, and more.

Proof of reputation contracts

A series of interconnected Smart Contracts, enabling Trustscore being computed and stored on
Blockchain to avoid any biases or fraudulent activity around the calculation of user's performance
for the specific set of transactions. These smart contracts aim at recording, analyzing, and
benchmarking historic records of users in accordance with set parameters and conditions. These
are highly customizable smart contracts offering a wide range of use cases like performance
measuring, credit rating, user identification to name a few.

Cross chain bridge contracts

As the name suggests this unique set of smart contracts enables cross-chain transactions for
real-time lending, borrowing, and management of digital assets in a non-custodial manner. This
means users can lend assets without moving tokens over the blockchain networks. Non-custodial
collateral contacts create a synthetic supply of digital assets, thereby locking original tokens or
assets in itself and enabling transactions over various networks. The collateral derives the value
from market oracles and reconciles with corresponding assets during the transaction cycle through
network nodes.

Atomic cross-chain swaps enable exchanging one token for another on different blockchain
networks while cross-chain bridges act as an immediate fix to enable interaction between different
blockchain networks. The protocol aims at using these cross-chain bridges to enable cross-chain
atomic swaps of the token in real-time for lending & borrowing of digital assets. This means asset
suppliers (lenders) & seekers (borrowers) can access different markets, financial products across
different blockchain networks simultaneously.

Risk management

Risk is inherent to lending and needs to be managed in accordance to different market
requirements. For instance, risks inherent to microlending or undercollateralized lending seek
unique risk parameters to ensure the management of defaults or non-payments. Different financial
products have a different set of standards, parameters, risk models, and mechanisms. The protocol
offers a complete agile environment to adhere to, test, and deploy respective risk modeling
strategies and parameters.

The protocol is designed to create risk management parameters which deem essential while
interacting with more decentralized protocols, DAOs, and platforms. Users can propose, set, and
approve such parameters and design mechanisms for robust governance and the addition of new
risk management capabilities to the protocol.

12
15. Governance

The protocol's on-chain governance model allows for reaching consensus among different network
participants through a direct voting mechanism. The chain governance mechanism influences
participants’ behavior on the network with the purpose of weeding out bad actors and
incentivizing good actors so that the network runs completely unencumbered. The stake weighted
mechanism offers stakeholders holding higher stakes with greater voting rights to set various
parameters, propose and define new rules, markets, collateral limits, etc. The protocol also defines
the scope of off-chain governance which will be detailed over time to time with users.

16. Dual Yield Farming

Governance delegation combined with novel incentivization structure has enabled a great deal of
decentralization. The network effect with vested interest helps create large value networks. Yield
farming makes a network robust and unleashes great economic innovation. Yield farming includes
a digital asset holder putting his digital assets to work by investing it in the network itself. In return,
they are paid a fixed or variable interest on their invested crypto assets.

For accelerating the adoption of this newly launched lending protocol and attracting new liquidity
onto a layer two blockchain network, we would like to introduce a new variant of yield farming or
liquidity mining called "Dual Yield Farming” whereby EasyFi along with different partner projects,
will allocate a portion of EASYFI tokens (EASY) and partner project's native token (say XYZ)
towards incentivizing liquidity providers and yield farmers. This in turn, we believe, will bring in
community interest and supply to the protocol hence enabling desired liquidity as well as
engagement.

Under dual yield farming, a higher APY ( Annual percentage yield) can be achieved in a sustainable
manner. Since the inflation of native token is controlled and is complemented through
corresponding emission of incentives of another partner token, users tend to earn more, in a
sustainable way, over the period of time. By innovating yield farming structure and combining
forces with other quality projects, easyfi has adopted an open-minded approach for a more
collaborative & engaged community with an end goal of incentivizing users for the long term and
earning their loyalty. More details on dual farming and subsequent collaborations shall be made
public from time to time.

13
Design ethos

01. Blockchain agnostic

We believe niche ecosystems like DeFi are just the start to an era where many such ecosystems
shall be replicated over numerous blockchain networks and L2 networks. Likewise, we may witness
mushrooming of more financial and non-financial niche ecosystems for retail and enterprise users.
Therefore, it is needed to adopt a flexible approach and create a system that enables interaction
& exchange of digital assets between such networks easier.

EasyFi universal layer 2 protocol is designed as blockchain agnostic and L2 agnostic that can
interact between various networks using appropriate mechanisms.

02. Ethereum compatibility

Ethereum's network through smart contracts capability has facilitated thousands of businesses
and enabled millions of users to interact and exchange. The strength of the network lies in the
ecosystem it has created over a period of time. There are thousands of developers who are
working tirelessly to create amazing products. It is, therefore, not possible to create anything in
silos.

EasyFi network protocol is designed to be ethereum compatible, blockchain agnostic, a
multi-network universal protocol to enable exchange and interaction of digital assets.

03. Interoperability

Projects like Polkadot, fusion, cosmos specialized in interoperability and link siloed blockchains.
These projects enable the transfer of value and data over numerous networks. Interoperability is
pertinent to scale markets and bring more users. Different blockchain networks cannot operate in
silos and need to interact with each other.

EasyFi is designed in a way to interact with other protocols which enables interoperability.

04. Staking involved consensus & governance

Governance delegation mechanisms empower network users and participants with more
engagement and value derivation. The protocol is designed to enable staking at multiple levels
and facilitate governance through moderated voting mechanisms. We intend to design to keep
protocol interactive, participative, and one that offers convenience to developers & end-users.

05. Network security

The set of rules and configurations designed to protect the integrity, confidentiality & accessibility
of the network covers a multitude of technologies, devices, and processes. It is pertinent to adopt
the best possible measures to keep security utmost. Therefore, the protocol is designed as per the
highest standards and thus offers a desired amount of security to enable secure transfer of value
and data over numerous networks.

14
Governance

01. Stake weighted voting

The primary governance mechanism in EasyFi universal protocol is through on-chain voting by the
participants keeping in account the weightage attached to their stake within the scope of exercise.
Each participant enjoys governing rights, in proportion to the number of tokens staked on the
network. Users need to perform various activities on the network to become eligible for staking
rewards.

Stakeholders can float a proposal to the governing community and seek participation from
community members. To avoid flooding of proposals or proposal spam, proposal creators need to
ensure a minimum level of participation or otherwise, a portion of their stake is forfeited as a
penalty. This ensures a clean and more participative governance delegation across the
community.

02. Event determination

For specific events like interest rate determination, collateral requirement, weighted stake
decisions, the addition of trading markets, defining trading parameters, etc. that requires
additional thoughtfulness a special proposal be created, and community participation is sought.
In addition to stakeholder's weighted stake average, the user's activity & network participation be
taken into account as an eligibility to participate in voting.

This comprehensive approach helps in the determination of events of special importance and
ensures holistic participation from members of the governing community. All proposals and
events shall be listed in the main forum from time to time and moderated on basis of stake &
participative voting, therefore.

eToken contracts

All the interactions between money markets and users are facilitated through eTokens; users can mint,
redeem, borrow, repay borrow, liquidate eTokens from, and for underlying assets in respective money
markets. Smart contracts have implemented ERC20 token specification for each money market.
Exchange rate (r) defines the settlement of eTokens & underlying assets, which increases in proportion
to interest accrued over time and has a direct relation to the market ( a) total borrowing balance.

underlying balance, + total borrow balance, -reservesa

Exchange rate (r) =
eTokenSupplya

EASY

Token Utility

EasyFi native token ‘EASY’ will be used for the following key functions:

Governance: SEASY token will enable users to be able to play part in the protocol’s governance as
EasyFi is going to become a DAO and enable the community to control various governance decisions
w.r.t. Running the protocol.

Protocol Incentivization: will enable users to earn rewards from time to time and provide them with
voting rights in the upkeep of the protocol and continuous development.

Staking rewards: SEASY token will enable various projects to launch their lending and borrowing
markets on the EasyFi network hence will enable them to reward the users to stake SEASY tokens for
earning rewards in form of tokens of the respective markets and interact with corresponding markets on
the protocol.

Cross market interaction: EasyFi is the first protocol in the DeFi space to enable dual token farming,
hence enabling various markets being launched on EASYFI to be able to incentivize EASYFi users to
interact with those respective markets.

Cross Chain Settlement: SEASY tokens will be used as a cross-chain settlement instrument in the

various bridges created to communicate and share the liquidity with various other sidechain and main
chains being built over a period of time like Binance Smart Chain, Polkadot, etc.

Abstract

Qbao is a Qtum based social network that incorporates mobile terminals, desktop,
various web systems and browser plugins, designed to be the "WeChat" built on the
Qtum protocol (the Qbao Platform). This whitepaper sets out the Foundation's
proposed plan for the network, product design and various application scenarios of

Qbao Platform and the usage of Qbao Token (QBT).

The Foundation aims to serve the Qtum community and global blockchain users,
enabling people to better experience the new generation of blockchain technology,
Qtum, and various other decentralised applications (DAPP) based on Qtum. The
Foundation aims to popularise blockchain technology in the more traditional Internet
fields through Qbao Platform by allowing users to experience the functionality and
charm of blockchain technology. The Foundation's vision is for Qbao Platform to
become a social network similar to the WeChat network, which has a complete

ecosystem of services and ancillary services.

QBT is a QRC-20 standard token built on Qtum protocol and is the core of the social
network on Qbao Platform. As designed, QBT will be used for the following services /

products:
A wallet that supports multiple cryptocurrency
Decentralized peer-to-peer encrypted communication
Trust Social
Knowledge payment
Payment gateway and clearing
DAPP store
Emoticons and skin market

Product promotion engine

Community of user generated content

Token based social network

Qbao Platform is a Qtum based, decentralised and trusted social network. The creators
of previous social networks play the dual role of "manager" and "mediator", thus
resulting in users and other stakeholders in the social network having very little right to
express themselves. In the social network on Qbao Platform, all users are equal, and are
required to conform to a common decentralised autonomous protocol. They have equal

status, and jointly participate in the decentralised social network.

QBT will be used on the Qbao Platform in order to enable users to receive services in

various application scenarios.

Qbao Platform changes the previous situation where owners of social network
owners play a dual role of both “manager and mediator” and provides a
decentralised autonomous protocol that users are required to abide by. In the
decentralised autonomous protocol, QBT is representative of the right of speech,

so people may jointly participate in the Qbao Platform in a fair way.

Users may obtain various value-added social services by spending QBT, for

example, encrypted p2p communication, emoticons and skin market.

An ecosystem can be established through QBT, for example, trust social,
knowledge payment, massive DAPPs. Besides, creators, partners or users can all

benefit from the ecosystem.

QBT can be used as the unit of exchange between users and content suppliers,

developing new modes of cooperation and bringing their relationship closer.

Through the usage of QBT, users of the social network and Internet advertisers will

be able to allocate interests in a manner. Advertisers and users can achieve their

7/40
objectives through the sharing of advertisements, with payments by advertises

made in the form of QBT.

QBT is a non-refundable functional utility token which will be used as the unit of
exchange between participants on the Qbao Platform for the use of decentralised
products and services. QBT does not in any way represent any shareholding,
participation, right, title, or interest in the Foundation or any other company, enterprise
or undertaking, nor will QBT entitle token holders to any promise of fees, revenue,
profits or investment returns, and are not intended to constitute securities in Singapore
or any relevant jurisdiction. QBT may only be utilised on the Qbao Platform, and
ownership of QBT carries no rights, express or implied, other than the right to use QBT

as a means to enable usage of and interaction with the Qbao Platform.

In particular, you understand and accept that QBT:

(a)is non-refundable cannot be exchanged for cash (or its equivalent value in any other

virtual currency) or any payment obligation by the Foundation or any affiliate;

(b)does not represent or confer on you any right of any form with respect to the
Foundation (or any of its affiliates) or its revenues or assets, including without limitation
any right to receive future revenue, shares, ownership right or stake, share or security,
any voting, distribution, redemption, liquidation, proprietary (including all forms of
intellectual property), or other financial or legal rights or equivalent rights, or intellectual
property rights or any other form of participation in or relating to the Qbao Platform,

the Foundation and/or its service providers;

(c)is not intended to be a representation of money (including electronic money),
security, commodity, bond, debt instrument or any other kind of financial instrument or

investment;

(d)is not a loan to the Foundation or any of its affiliates, is not intended to represent a
debt owed by the Foundation or any of its affiliates, and there is no expectation of

profit; and

8/40
(e)does not provide you with any ownership or other interest in the Foundation or any

of its affiliates.

In addition, Qbao Platform is also designed to provide a wide range of support for
various decentralised applications (DAPPs) and tokens built on the Qtum protocol,
enabling the usage of services provided by other DAPPs and tokens built on the Qtum
protocol, for example, through the prediction markets on Bodhi and sharing of videos

on VEVUE around the world.

Under this model, creators of the network, partners and users can maintain the whole
social network in a more equal and reasonable manner. Each participant will be
incentivised for assisting with the maintenance of the network, and thereby there will be

an increase in the network value of the entire social network on Qbao Platform.

9/40
Partnership with Qtum

Qtum is a public blockchain developed and maintained by the Qtum Foundation.
Compared with other public blockchains, Qtum supports UTXO account system, smart
contract and MPOS consensus mechanism, as well as segregated witness and
decentralised autonomous protocol. Based on this new generation of blockchain
technology, Qbao Platform is designed to provide users with a decentralised,
trustworthy and cryptographic social network system where creators, network users

and partners can jointly participate in the social network in a fair way.

The Foundation had chosen to build on Qtum protocol for the following reasons:

1.Qtum can be compatible with UTXO account and EVM smart contract. Therefore, this
not only provides users with a safe cryptocurrency experience, but can also support
massive third-party smart contracts and DAPPs, allowing users to experience the

functionality and charm of blockchain technology.

2.The realisation of MPOS consensus mechanism and community autonomous protocol
lays a foundation for Qbao Platform to establish a decentralised social network. Based
on the technology, Qbao Platform will create a new social network where each user may

jointly participate in a fair way.

3.Qtum offers strong community and technical support to assist us in developing Qbao
Platform. We anticipate that Qtum's community support will also help to introduce Qbao
Platform to targeted customers more rapidly, thus obtaining exponential growth in

usage.

4.The key team and partners behind Qtum are supportive of Qbao Platform. Based on
close relationships and cooperation, the Foundation will be able to further improve the
ecosystem for the Qbao Platform, and also provide help for the whole community and

ecosystem of Qtum.

As a new generation blockchain technology, Qtum provides higher performance, better
user experience and development environment with rich support of community DAPPs.

The Foundation's firm belief is that given that the Qbao Platform is based on Qtum,

10/40
which is a decentralised, cryptographic and trustworthy protocol, the social network

system on the Qbao Platform will grow more rapidly and in a more favourable manner.

11/40
Qbao Application Scenarios

1.The wallet that supports multiple digital assets

The first application scenario of Qbao Platform is a decentralised wallet that supports

multiple digital assets.

Blockchain is the Internet of value, and digital tokens are the core and cornerstone of
the Internet of value. The ability to own and safely keep tokens enables various DAPPS
on blockchains to be used. Therefore, in the first version that has been launched, Qbao
Platform supports the collection and transferring of Qtum and tokens built on the Qtum
protocol, e.g. Bodhi, Ink and Vevue. Users will be able to conveniently withdraw tokens
purchased from third party exchanges to the digital wallet on the Qbao Platform wallet
for safekeeping. In later versions, the digital wallet on Qbao Platform will support BTC

and various other digital assets.

Qbao Platform's wallet function is decentralised. Decentralisation means that not only
will the digital assets be recorded as a value in a centralised database, but that digital
asset will also be recorded on the public blockchain. Each user transaction and record

will be truthfully recorded in the production network of Qtum and cannot be tampered.

Qbao Platform's wallet function is designed to be safe. Qbao Platform adopts the
Elliptic Curves Cryptography and double signature technology, with every transaction
signed and cryptographic. Qbao Platform will never preserve and transmit users private

key, and will also provide a cold wallet function to ensure the security of users' assets.

Qbao Platform's digital wallet function is designed to be easy to use. Compared with
other products, Qbao Platform provides perfect user experience, and makes it
convenient to manage the digital assets. In addition, the digital wallet supports all

tokens built on the Qtum protocol, such as Ink, Bodhi, Energo, Vevue, Medibloc.

2. Decentralized peer to peer encrypted communication

The current social networks like WeChat, QQ, Facebook, Twitter, are all based on a
centralised database, meaning that all messages sent by people are preserved in the
social network owner’ s database. Therefore, the social network owners have full

control, "God" mode, and can review and filter all messages.

However, the Qbao Platform is designed to provide p2p encrypted communication
service - all messages sent by users are encrypted, only the receivers can decrypt the
contents, and the message can only be preserved by senders and receivers (the
message will not be retained in any other third-party system). As a result, privacy and

concealment of social contact is ensured.

To guarantee that p2p encrypted communication will not be interrupted by network
issues, and also to ensure that the communication service is efficient, safe and stable,
the Qbao Platform allows certain qualified individuals, organisations or companies to
establish "QbaoHub" stations. The function of QbaoHub stations are to transmit
encrypted messages, and in return the operators of QbaoHub stations will be able to

receive a network fee in the form of QBT (proportionate to the amount of information

13/40
processed by that QbaoHub station). QobaoHub stations are only able to send messages

and are not able to retain the contents of any private messages.

QBT Usage

Users will need to purchase p2p encrypted communication service with QBT. A portion
of the QBT paid will be provided to QbaoHub stations (which send messages) as
network fee.

Instance

User A is an ordinary user who needs to send some secret data and purchases

p2p encrypted communication service with QBT.

14/40
User B maintains a QbaoHub station, and a portion of the QBT purchased by User
A will be paid to User B (as network fee) for assisting to send User A's p2p

encrypted messages.

If a user who purchased the QbaoHub service is forbidden due to various reasons,
the message will be autonomously transferred to be processed by another
alternative QbaoHub. If communication is smooth, the portion of the QBT
purchased by User A to be paid as network fee will be paid to the new QobaoHub

instead.

15/40
3. Trust Social

In social networks, credibility of the information provider is important. Thus for example,
in WeChat, users are marked with “VIP” to prevent the transmission of false news.
This model has proven effective in preventing malicious slander and network violence in
social networks. In Qbao Platform, users may use QBT to purchase the “VIP” mark to

prevent imitation of fake users.

In addition, in the centralised era, there is a Chinese app called “Small Secret Circle”

which had attracted wide attention. In the app, all users are required to pay certain
basic fees to join into the network, which helps to guarantee that all the users in the
network are interested. From the point of view of founders and moderators of the
network, the presence of paying users would impose restraints and incentives to ensure

the quality of content published.

Qbao Platform will provide the ability for social networks and groups to be created for
free. However at the same time, founders and moderators of each network will also be
able to specify certain amounts of QBT which will have to be paid as a fee in order to

join private network, which will ensure privacy and a more exclusive experience.

QBT Usage

QBT will be required to establish and join private social networks.
Identity authentication in social networks can be purchased with QBT.

Instance
User A is a professional investment manager who wishes to discuss trends in NY
stocks. He may create a private group requiring participants to pay at least 20

QBT as a requirement to participate.

User B is the developer of a Qtum DAPP who wishes to publish certain information
about his project. He may create a private group requiring participants to pay at
least 1 token (belonging to his own project, e.g. Bodhi) as a requirement to

participate.

User C is an entrepreneur who wishes to increase his reputation through more
distinct and obvious signs in social networks, so he may purchase a “big V” sign

with QBT.

17/40
4. Knowledge Payment

Taking inspiration from existing knowledge payment products such as Fenda, Zhihu
Live and Iget, Qbao Platform will also provide knowledge payment mechanism for key
opinion leaders in various fields (Such as blockchain experts, technical experts,

investment experts).

Users may invite popular key opinion leaders to answer some questions, and in return
paying them an amount of QBT. Other users may also listen in to the discussion by
paying an amount of QBT. It is contemplated that the "appearance fee" in QBT will be
paid directly to the key opinion leaders, while the QBT paid by users listening in will be

distributed between the key opinion leaders and the initiator of the discussion.

Through this mechanism for payment for knowledge, it is hoped that the Foundation
will be able to promote the development of the whole ecosystem of Qtum more rapidly

and in a better manner.

18/40
QBT Usage

Users need to purchase knowledge with QBT

Instance

User A may invite the chief engineer of Qtum to answer some questions with 10

QBT which will be distributed to respondents.

User B may listen in to the discussion by paying 0.1 QBT and obtain the same

information.

As an example, if there are an additional 100 users who listen in to the discussion,

this additional amount will be paid to both the initiator and the respondent.

19/40
5. Payment Gateway and Clearing Service

In order for cryptocurrencies to be more widely linked to the "real" economy, payment

gateways and clearing services are required.

Qbao Platform is committed to creating an ecosystem of Qtum by increasing the
applications of Qtum and other tokens, thus it is important to providing payment
services for cryptocurrency servicing online and offline It is planned that Qbao Platform
will develop a payment gateway for Qtum, providing a clearing service to supply
business services for various online and offline merchants who can easily receive Qtum

and carry out clearing.

The clearing service will be completely free for merchants, which is conducive to
expanding the Qtum community and payment scenarios to the largest extent. The fee

charged by Qbao Platform will be the channel fee commission of transaction costs.

20/40
QBT Usage

Merchants will be required to pay QBT to link with the payment gateway of Qtum or

other tokens.

Instance
Merchant A needs to link with the payment gateway of Qtum (or other tokens built
on Qtum protocol), in order to use the payment gateway and clearing service

provided by Qbao Platform.

The connection of merchant A is free, but Qbao Platform will charge channel fees
of the payment flow. This fee will be shared between Qbao Platform and its

agencies.

21/40
6. DAPP Store

The value and significance of a public blockchain depends on the number of users of
the blockchain. To a large extent, this number will depend on the number of DAPPs
available on the public blockchain. When there are more and more valuable DAPPs on a
blockchain, there will be more users who use that blockchain, and the growth will be

faster. This is the so-called ecosystem.

In order for Qbao Platform to become the gateway of Qtum, Qbao Platform will
establish a DAPP store and allow the partners of Qtum blockchain community and
development fans to publish DAPPs and smart contacts in the DAPP store. This will
make it convenient for users to obtain the DAPPs and smart contracts they want, and

evaluate the DAPP with the evaluation system based on QBT of Qbao Platform.

In addition, users will be able to use smart contracts in social networks for functions

such as initiating a vote, forecasting, or performing a contract.

QBT Usage

Developers which wish to release smart contracts on the Qbao Platform will be

required to pay a certain amount of QBT.

Developers which wish to release DAPPs in the DAPP store on the Qbao Platform
will be required to pay a certain amount of QBT. This will disincentivise the release

of fraudulent DAPPs.

Instance
Developer A may develop and release a smart contract on the Qbao Platform. If
this smart contract is used by users, part of the usage fee will be paid to that
developer automatically, which will helo promote users to develop some excellent

intelligent contracts and expand the Qtum community.

Developer B may release a DAPP in the store on Qbao Platform in order to

increase the popularity, availability and usage of that DAPP.

22/40
User C will be required to hold a certain number of QBT in his account before he
will be granted the right to evaluate and score DAPPs - this is intended to prevent

malicious behavior.

23/40
7. Emoticon and Skin Market

For the current generation of Internet users, emoticons and skins are in high demand in

the various social networks. Generally, the younger the user base, the more stable and

continuous will be the demand for emoticons and skin. For the recently released Iphone

X, a large selling point was the unique emoji package based on face recognition

technology, which illustrates that the market for emoticons and skins is huge.

The Qbao Platform is designed to establish its own independent emoticon and skin
market by defining a series of specifications, which will allow users to establish and

submit their own emoticon and skin, and permitting users to purchase favoured
emoticon and skin packages using QBT. QBT is used as the mode of payment for this

transaction and the creator of the emoticon and skin will obtain majority of the
payment.

24/40
QBT Usage
Purchasing and using emoticon and skin package
Instance
Users may select their favourite emoticon and skin in the market and purchase

them using QBT.

Creator of emoticons and skins will be able to submit their unique emoticon and
skin package on to the market, set pricing and commission relationships, in order

to receive payment in QBT from the sales of emoticon and skin.

25/40
8. Product Promotion Engine

As part of the process of continuous expansion of Qbao Platform, with increased
number of users, the flow of services through Qbao Platform will be more valuable.
Advertisers with advertisement requirement may also purchase advertisement services
from advertising agencies, in order to make their own products known by more people
through the product promotion engine of Qbao Platform, so as to increase sales of
their products. Qbao Platform will refer to the features of the advertisement of
information flow, and combine product promotion and advertisement with users-
generated contents through the product promotion engine. The advantage of
information flow advertisement lies in advertisements being able to accurately reach
the target audience, as well as relatively smooth feelings for the advertising process.

Based on the promotion, users can easily view the products they require.

Qbao Platform is also intended to integrate various applications on the Qtum, provide
application scenarios and token usage, and promote their products and services
through product promotion engines. The product promotion engine will be applied to
market promotion of Qbao Platform to attract more users to participate in Qbao

Platform and Qtum community.

QBT Usage

Cooperating with various DAPPs on Qtum. Need to exchange with QBT and

purchase the application scenario of DAPP.

The Qbao Platform will receive a portion of QBT as the cost of marketing

campaigns.

Advertisers will be required to purchase advertisement from advertising agencies
with QBT in order to launch the advertisement. The QBT paid by advertisers will be

shared between the advertising agencies and the Qbao Platform.

26/40
9. Digital Assets Exchange

Similar to Binance, the quotation function of cryptocurrency is presently being
developed on the Qbao Platform, which is planned to support Qtum and BTC. In the
future, Qbao Platform will support more tokens based on Qtum and other mainstream
cryptocurrencies. Qbao Platform will provide cryptocurrency market and transaction
data to allow users to have greater understanding of industry information for

cryptocurrencies.

On the other hand, with the development of the decentralised exchange, transactions
among digital assets becomes a very important. Qbao Platform aims to develop tools
for a decentralised exchange protocol for its users to offer exchange services. The
decentralised exchange among digital assets will not be operated by any entity, does
not need a centralised database (compared with previous matchmaking trading), and all
transactions are recorded on blockchains, which is very safe and convenient. In
addition, compared with previous centralised transactions, exchange fees will be very

low.

21/40
QBT Usage

QBT will be used for payment of exchange fees for smart-contract based

transactions on the decentralised exchange provided by Qbao Platform.

For users who trade with higher frequency, QBT may be purchased and held to

receive some discount off exchange fees.

To the extent a secondary market or exchange for trading QBT does develop, it would
be run and operated wholly independently of the Foundation (or its affiliates), the sale
of QBT and the Qbao Platform. The Qbao Platform will only provide the tools for

decentralised exchange.

28/40
10. Community of User Generated Content (UGC)

For a social network to grow, User Generate Content (UGC) is necessary. Through
UGC and under the guidance of key opinion leaders (KOL), the activity of the whole

community would grow and allow participation by each user in a fair way.

For the Qtum community, the Qbao Platform will establish UGC, increase the
members of Qtum community, improve the community stickiness, and increase
community activity and topic discussions, which are the UGC community created

based the QBT system.

In the community system of Qbao Platform, users may publish UGC (e.g. articles,
thoughts and concepts), and promote them to users in the community through the
promotion engine of Qbao Platform. Users on the Qbao Platform may also interact
with these UGC by giving "thumbs up", commenting, and encouraging content

generators with donations of QBT.

For users who continuously contribute high-quality articles, thereby creating more
value, their reputation and KOL status will accordingly be higher. This allows them to
obtain high-quality and superior promotion. Compared with previous centralised
systems, the completely open regulation engine is driven by algorithms which will

take into account the actions of all community members on the Qbao Platform.

QBT Usage

Content generators are required to pay a certain amount of QBT to promote UGC

content.

According to the nature of UGC, the content will be promoted to the users of the

community on Qbao Platform through promotion engines of Qbao Platform.

Qbao Platform users can incentivise the creation of their favorite content with

QBT.

With the continued generation of high-quality UGC, the status of content authors

will improve constantly, and these authors will be able to obtain the prior

29/40
promotion of the promotion engine of Qbao Platform, cooperate with advertisers,

and obtain open, transparent and reasonable incentives for producing content.

30/40
Roadmap

The project to develop the Qbao Platform has obtained support from the Qtum
Foundation at the beginning, and these contributions are held by the Foundation to
support the continued development of Qbao Platform. At present, the Foundation has
completed development of the function in the first version of Qbao Platform and
completed the first scenario of ten application scenarios, i.e. the decentralised wallet
function that supports multiple cryptocurrencies, which lays the foundation for the

ecosystem of the whole Qbao Platform.

Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with

QBT and/or the Qbao Platform in a variety of ways.

8.2 Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions

The regulatory status of QBT and ancillary ecosystems, and distributed ledger
technology generally is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is impossible to
predict how, when or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulations or
create new regulations with respect to such technology and its applications, including
QBT and/or the Qbao Platform. Regulatory actions could negatively impact QBT and/

or the Qbao Platform in various ways.

8.3 Insufficient Interest

It is possible that the Qbao Platform will not be used by a large number of individuals,
companies and other entities or that there will be limited public interest in the
creation and development of distributed ecosystems (such as the network or the
platform). Such a lack of use or interest could negatively impact the development of

the Qbao Platform.

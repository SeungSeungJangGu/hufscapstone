1 Executive Summary Xi MineBee

Data is the fuel that drives the cryptocurrency economy. In an industry formed around virtual
currencies that are created and traded in digital form, participants are dependant upon
accurate, real-time data from an array of sources. The binary and hexadecimal data that
constitutes wallet addresses, private keys and blockchain headers, as well as that pertaining
to network hashrate, coin velocity, UTXOs and a host of other metrics, is ripe for analysis.

The data derived from public blockchains is immensely valuable to entities that operate in
multiple industry verticals. Valuable insights can be extrapolated from processed data and
used to determine trading decisions, fee estimation, investment strategies, and to gauge
everything from market cycles to the behavior of major ecosystem players such as
cryptocurrency exchanges and so-called “whales”.

As the quality and scope of crypto-analytical tools has increased, so has the role played by
data as a driver of key business strategies. Not every area of the cryptoconomy has been
served by the growth in analytical services, with one sector in particular starved of
high-quality data-driven insights - the mining industry.

The tools available to cryptocurrency miners are largely unrefined, supplying little more than
generic information regarding network hashrate, coin profitability, and hardware
performance. The most valuable data of all - the sort that has the potential to eke out greater
efficiencies and to ease loss-making mining operations into profit - lies deeper below the
surface. Extracting this data and drawing actionable outcomes from it is a complex but
lucrative task that has proven beyond the reach of mining service providers.

MineBee intends to change that. Through the use of big data, accrued with the aid of its
mining rig management partners, MineBee will deliver valuable insights that will be licensed
as technology support. From overclocking to temperature regulation and from coin selection
to hardware optimization, MineBee will help to refine every last facet of the cryptocurrency
mining business. The result will be less downtime, fewer performance-related hazards,
greater hashrate, and ultimately greater profits.

1 Executive Summary Xi MineBee

Miners who access MineBee’s vast trove of data, delivered via its industry partners, will hold
a significant competitive edge. Miners are reliant on multiple data points to maximize profits
while ensuring their equipment remains within safe operating parameters.

Modest refinements can be the difference between profit and loss. As a result, access to
accurate data in real-time is not just desirable - it is essential.

MineBee Solution will instantly be able to tap into a large community of miners through its
links to key business partners. In this way, MineBee will overcome the inherent challenges of
building its own community and ecosystem from scratch. Through focusing on B2B licensing,
MineBee will quickly begin generating revenue without attempting community acquisition,
one of the main causes of failed ICOs.

In addition to providing an advanced data analysis service, MineBee is developing a market to
facilitate the buying and selling of new and second-hand mining equipment. MineBee Open
Market will enable new entrants to begin mining by removing the cost barriers which
currently exist and allow established miners to offset the costs of upgrading through the sale
of old equipment. With new equipment from leading manufacturers also showcased, the
marketplace will provide vendors with greater exposure and increased sales.

From inception, the market will be supported by MineBee Contract, a secure, fast and
cost-effective smart contract that will facilitate cryptocurrency payments. The contract will
offer payment in MineBee’s native MB token as well as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Functionality
will include the monitoring and automatic validation of wallet addresses and user accounts,
transaction amounts, the number of transactions being processed, transaction throughput
and transaction status. Once escrow functionality has been rolled out, MineBee Contract will
form a standalone system capable of facilitating trustless transactions for a range of
purposes, both within MineBee Open Market and for third parties that have integrated the
MineBee Contract payment module. MineBee will be available as an open API for payment
integration in a range of industries, including those that operate outside of the cryptocurrency
space.

2 Market Overview <i MineBee

Cryptocurrency mining is the backbone of Proof of Work coins. Miners compete to add blocks
to a public ledger, with the first miner to find the correct hash function within a desired range
entitled to the block reward plus any fees attached to the transactions contained within it.
This process of work and reward incentivizes miners to produce the cryptographic proofs that
secure the network and ensure its continued stability, which in turn supplies users with the
confidence to adopt and invest in these protocols. Since miners are financially motivated to
validate transactions, and their remuneration is directly proportional to the hashrate they
contribute to the network, they welcome any and every means by which their operation can
be refined.

Miners can make significant profits depending on market conditions, hashrate, network
difficulty, and other factors, but their fortunes can swing wildly. In early 2017, for example,
thousands of solo miners purchased GPUs and began mining Ethereum, which was rising
rapidly in value at the time. Many Ethereum miners realized significant profits before
increased competition raised the network hashrate and eroded economic incentives for
small-scale operators.

While 2017 saw record growth throughout the cryptocurrency industry, this was followed by
an extremely testing 2018 that left miners struggling. Since late 2017, the value of bitcoin has
dropped by 75% while ethereum has fallen by around 90%, making it increasingly challenging
to derive a profit from cryptocurrency mining. Most altcoins have suffered even more
dramatic losses during this timeframe, in some cases shedding over 90% from their peak
value. With crypto assets trading at significantly reduced prices, many miners have found
their business model to be no longer viable.

In November 2018, a number of major Chinese cryptocurrency miners were found to be
dumping their equipment as the economic climate made it no longer cost-effective to
continue. By this point, the solo miners who first supported the growth of the major
blockchains had already bowed out since they could no longer afford to keep their equipment
running. As Diar observed in October 2018, “mining has, at least for now, and most likely in
the future, moved into the court of bigger players with deep pockets.

2 Market Overview Xi MineBee

It is not just smaller and independent miners who have been forced to cease operations in this
tougher prevailing climate, with large-scale mining businesses also stretched. GMO Internet,
for example, who allocated around 10% of the firm’s capital and resources to a coin mining
venture in June of 2018, reported losses of $320 million in Q4 of 2018 and officially ceased all
mining. In November 2018, the North American mining company Giga Watt went bankrupt,
leaving creditors out of pocket to the tune of millions of dollars. Despite the recent market
downturn, however, the industry continues to innovate and to attract new entrants.

Market size

The hashrate of a cryptocurrency network provides a broad indicator of the number of miners
connected to it. For example, the steady rise in hashpower on the BTC network from January
to October 2018 indicates that despite declining coin values, the number of miners joining the
network was steadily increasing (see figure 1). This was followed by a significant drop in
hashpower from November to December, indicating that miners began ceasing operations in
high numbers. Despite Bitcoin’s hashrate having partially recovered since late December,

it remains approximately 30% below its peak of 60 EH/s set in mid-2018.

2 Market Overview ii MineBee

2.1 Financial Challenges

The financial viability of cryptocurrency mining is dependant upon keeping operating costs at
a minimum while maximizing output. Miners face a constant battle to drive down production
costs, amid increased competition posed by new miners and new mining equipment joining
the network. Electricity costs, power consumption, cooling, hashrate, and overclocking
settings - as well as market prices - affect the profits that miners are able to realize through
selling the cryptocurrencies they earn as block rewards and transaction fees.

Figure 2: 2018’s decline in mining profitability

In both bear and bull markets, miners are driven to seek cost savings and performance
enhancements. Miners have no control over coin prices, but they can still maximize profits by
setting optimal hashing and overclocking values, choosing the most profitable coins to mine,
and reducing overheads by sourcing cheap electricity.

2 Market Overview Xi MineBee

The average electricity cost of mining most PoW coins still exceeds their market value by a
significant margin. As of January 14, 2019, Cryptocompare indicates an 81% daily loss on
mining Bitcoin and a 44% daily loss on mining Ether.

Miners intent on profiting from their profession must constantly monitor and adjust their
equipment to maximize revenue and remain competitive. Every miner has a break-even point,
a threshold below which it is no longer economically viable to maintain operations. When the
cost of mining coins falls below the profit to be derived from selling them, miners are faced
with the prospect of having to disband and sell their equipment at a loss, or wait for more
favorable market conditions to return, while still paying rent and other fixed costs.

2 Market Overview Xi MineBee

Deferring or preferably avoiding reaching the break-even point will allow miners to maintain
“skin in the game” and to continue production until fairer market conditions return. For
miners who have dropped out altogether by that point and divested themselves of their
equipment, resuming operations will not be feasible. Mining is essentially about survival,
therefore, with the victors claiming the bulk of the hashrate and the spoils.

Cryptocurrency mining is an adversarial environment by design, with miners not only
competing with one another to find blocks but also subjected to difficulty adjustments and
reduced block rewards that have been programmed into the protocol. This forces miners into
an arms race in which equipment must be regularly optimized in a bid to offset increased
difficulty, or replaced by newer, more powerful hardware. From a financial perspective,
boosting the output of existing equipment is preferable to upgrading it, which is why miners
push their rigs to the limit.

2.2 Informational Challenges

There are numerous ways in which miners can reduce their expenditure and operating costs
while increasing output, but this quest is hampered by an absence of accurate information.
To make informed choices, miners require up-to-date information, both at the point of sale
and in the day-to-day running of their operations.

2.2.1 Mining Data

Miners cannot simply plug in their machines and start profiting from mining PoW coins.
Optimal hash and overclock values are required to mine efficiently and profitably. The only
way to identify the optimal values for any coin is to pool and analyze data from many mining
machines. Modern big data techniques can produce insights regarding the most efficient
mining values for the benefit of all participants.

Although such insights have the potential to optimize mining operations, big data analytics
methods are reliant on having access to vast data pools. Very little live mining data is made

2 Market Overview ii MineBee

publically accessible since few solo miners have any reason to collect and publish data on
their own operations. The data of large numbers of miners is available to mining monitoring
and management services, but these entities currently have no incentive to share this data.

In order to implement performance enhancements, mining and monitoring services must be
incentivized to collect and share anonymized user data, and users of these services must be
incentivized to share their data.

2.2.2 Marketplace Data

At present, the manufacture of mining rigs is highly centralized with a handful of businesses
dominating the sector. The result is a market which is uncompetitive, with detrimental knock-
on effects, particularly in terms of price. Consumers are faced with a limited number of
options when deciding which equipment to purchase, and manufacturers remain free to
maintain high hardware prices. This problem is further exacerbated at the point of sale where
the market has no price comparison site, nor is there a place to easily purchase second-hand
hardware.

For established miners who wish to sell their used equipment, there is no widely-adopted
platform on which they can advertise the inventory. Most existing e-commerce marketplaces
levy high fees to list items for sale, to set a safety reserve and to add special qualifications to a
sale. Further, they typically charge a minimum of 10% on the total value of the sale in fees.
These charges can render the sale of second-hand mining equipment financially non-viable,
leading to perfectly functional mining hardware languishing in storage, or simply being
scrapped altogether.

2.3 Safety Challenges
To date, no comprehensive study has been conducted on the dangers of leaving mining

equipment unattended. However, a number of reported incidents of fires caused by mining
hardware demonstrate the hazards posed. In 2014, a fire at a bitcoin mining facility in Thailand

sRUSeeeee
eneeeeeee
jpn eRe

ry Yee te ,
"ay Feats,

15

2 Market Overview Xi MineBee

caused significant damage, with 2,000 mining rigs destroyed in the blaze. In February 2018,
a fire engulfed the upper floor of a Russian apartment complex, destroying eight flats in
the process.

In addition to the anecdotal evidence that attests to the dangers of leaving highly powered rigs
unattended, there is the threat of mining rigs shutting down due to overheating, or complete
burnout. From a financial perspective, the threat this presents to miners is almost as severe,
given that their income is reliant on equipment performing optimally and running 24/7.

Miners must counter the need to operate equipment within safe parameters with the need to
overclock their machines and push them beyond their recommended limits in order to
maximize revenue. Excess overclocking, exacerbated by the heat build-up from having dozens
of GPUs or ASICs connected in parallel, can prove just as costly as underclocking. Coaxing
greater output from cryptocurrency miners without jeopardizing hardware or premises is a
delicate balancing act.

With lives to lead and other tasks to attend to, miners are forced to make tough choices.
They can either:

1. Leave mining equipment to operate unattended at the risk of technical breakdown or
potential fire risk.

2. Power down equipment when unattended, resulting in a loss of revenue.

3. Physically attend to machinery around the clock at great personal cost in terms of time,
or as a financial burden in the form of hired labor.

Since each of these options is sub-optimal, there is a clear case for a solution which allows
miners to safely maximize their mining performance and uptime while minimizing risks.

3.1.1 MineBee Solution

Big data is defined as “extremely large data sets that may be analyzed computationally to
reveal patterns, trends, and associations.” Through such big data analyses, MineBee Solution
will yield value-generating insights. As Peter Sondergaard, Senior Vice President of Gartner
puts it, "Information is the oil of the 21st century, and analytics is the combustion engine.”

In its raw extracted state, mining data is of limited value, but once it has been subjected to
MineBee’s deep pattern analysis, it gains a range of monetizable applications which can then
be licensed to business partners.

MineBee obtains data streams from its mining monitoring and management partners, who in
turn collect it from the miners who connect to their system. MineBee Solution integrates with
mining management systems through an API to collect data on mining operations of all sizes.
MineBee’s “combustion engine” processes this data to extract revenue-generating insights
regarding overclocking, cooling, and optimal hashing and coin selection. Mining companies
that license MineBee Solution will be granted access to this trove of processed data in real-time.

MineBee Solution will draw its data points from a wide range of inputs including:

Hashrate per GPU

Total GPU hashrate per rig
GPU temperatures

Full miner log archives
Error log archives

Reboot rate

MineBee Solution will also provide detailed hashing information for all popular PoW coins
including information pertaining to:

@ = Average and maximum hashrate for each coin
@ Maximum theoretical overclock according to VGA series, OS, and coin type
@ = Overclock information regarding memory (Mhz), fan speed, voltage, memory voltage etc

As overclocking and operational settings are improved, so is the likelihood if the miner
successfully solving a block hash and claiming the reward. The same information can also

reduce the risks associated with mining by identifying the maximal safe overclocking values for
different types of rigs.

Overclocking a mining rig beyond the levels recommended by the manufacturer could result in
systems outage, overheating, power overload damage, or may simply degrade the hardware
prematurely. MineBee Solution can identify these risks and suggest optimal overclocking
settings that are precisely configured for the system in question.

MineBee Solution creates value for a range of industry participants by increasing the efficiency,
safety, and profitability of mining operations. It achieves this by:

@ Providing real-time data processing tools that produce key insights on hashing data of
both coins and hardware, overclocking data, the profitability of mining certain coins,
and so on. Such insights may significantly improve the overall efficiency and value of
the mining industry.

@ Providing sophisticated performance analysis tools to partners who, in turn, provide
users with reliable remote monitoring and management services which negate the need
for constant physical monitoring. This will drastically reduce labor costs.

@ Rendering mining profitable by bringing new miners into the space and allowing
established miners to upgrade and expand their operations.

MineBee Solution provides incentives for new miners to get started and allows all miners to
improve the efficiency of their operations. It facilitates the entrance of new miners into the
industry by offering information, via third-party mining management services, that gives
prospective miners confidence their operations will be maximally efficient and profitable from
the outset.

Network effects

The more miners who connect to the MineBee ecosystem, the greater the dataset that can be
utilized, and the more valuable these performance-enhancing insights become. This creates a
positive feedback loop. The network effects of miners joining the MineBee network via
MineBee partners and submitting their mining performance data for analysis will drive even
greater efficiencies.

When used in conjunction with the MiningCom app, MineBee Solution provides mining
companies with unparalleled client management capabilities through its innovative sub ID
management solution. This enables users to update multiple mining rigs simultaneously and
to adjust hashrate, coin selection, and hashing algorithm.

Growth in blockchain wallet users

The growth of blockchain wallet users illustrates the huge potential of a versatile payment
module such as MineBee Contract. There is compelling evidence to suggest there is strong
interest in cryptocurrency deployment at point of sale, provided the technical challenges can
be overcome. A survey of 100 retailers with annual revenue of over $100,000 found that 60%
would be amenable to accepting cryptocurrency, while another survey found that 75% of
consumers would be open to using cryptocurrency in point of sale transactions.

3.1.3 MineBee Open Market

MineBee Open Market is designed to fulfill the needs of cryptocurrency miners everywhere.
As a globally accessible open market, it allows users to trade a range of hardware for the
purpose of establishing, growing or diversifying their mining operations. Over time, MineBee
Open Market will become a nexus for anyone who wishes to buy or sell a variety of mining-
related hardware.

MineBee’s licensed equipment marketplace will provide cost-effective solutions in the sale,
purchase, and pricing of hardware. MineBee Open Market allows new players to enter the
mining ecosystem, established miners to upgrade their existing operations, and hardware
manufacturers to gain exposure for their products.

The open market will immediately facilitate more informed purchasing decisions, which can
be completed in a shorter time. Prospective buyers can browse a range of new and used
hardware from multiple vendors, swiftly comparing specifications, offers, and prices. Using a

range of criteria to filter their searches by manufacturer, model, price, hashrate, and seller
location, buyers will quickly identify the correct equipment and best deal for them.

Additional features on MineBee Open Market will include a search function for global
electricity costs, with filters enabling users to search by country, region, or state.

For those making their first foray into cryptocurrency mining, complete GPU starter kits will
be among the packages available. These will include all of the hardware required to establish
a GPU mining rig such as graphics cards, motherboard and power supply. Whether buying
new equipment or used, comparisons between similar devices will become simpler, helping
to drive healthy competition in the sector.

Once established, the secondhand market will also deliver net benefits for cryptocurrency
mining as a whole, lowering the barriers to entry for new miners. Since high-end equipment is
regularly priced in the thousands of dollars, a cheaper alternative can help to onboard
participants who can progressively trade up as they begin to make a profit. Established
miners also benefit, offsetting some of the cost of their own purchases by selling their used
hardware. This mutually beneficial ecosystem will make upgrading a more cost-effective
process and create “liquidity” for used mining rigs.

As miners trade up and look to improve the profitability of their mining activities, it is
expected this will fuel an increased demand for advanced, high-performance hardware.
Detailed data analysis from MineBee Solution will encourage established miners to upgrade
when the evidence shows a compelling economic benefit to doing so.

Manufacturers who advertise on MineBee Open Market will enjoy significant exposure to
potential buyers. The marketplace will see high traffic due to its ease of use, convenience, and
competitive prices.

The open market will also allow manufacturers to closely liaise with their customers and
solicit feedback on how their products could be improved, for the benefit of all parties.

For manufacturers, vendors and users alike, MineBee Open Market will facilitate frictionless
trading with low fees and transactions quickly settled with MineBee contract.

3.1.4 MiningCom App

MineBee is working in partnership with MiningCom on the production and development of a
multifunctional and intuitive management app. This will allow users to remotely monitor and
control their mining operations remotely 24/7. The desktop version of the application, which
will be available for Windows, Linux, and macOS, will provide a single point of access to the
MiningCom platform as powered by MineBee solution.

App users will have access to pertinent mining-related data, as well as being able to monitor
the performance of their hardware in real time. The app’s remote management and
configuration system will allow users to control hardware temperatures, initiate machine
reboots, trigger file backups, and updates, and carry out a range of other operations that will
keep equipment optimized and operating within safe parameters.

The MiningCom app will also employ real-time messaging alerts to warn users of any critical
issues the moment they arise. This will allow swift action to be taken to remedy the matter.
Warnings can be triggered by such events such as hash rate decreasing, GPU temperature
rising or mining rig stoppages. With the aid of insights provided by MineBee Solution, miners
can customize settings with confidence, prioritize events that require their immediate
attention and calibrate software accordingly.

In the case that a mining device stops, the user can quickly and easily reboot the rig.
Alternatively, with the aid of an in-app diagnostic, it will be possible to troubleshoot the cause
of failure before determining the best course of action. The user can then decide whether to
reset the miner or to leave equipment powered down, pending inspection.

The MiningCom app will feature a range of free and premium services. Free services include:

@ Hashing information for a range of cryptocurrencies.
@ Market information including crypto asset prices and trading volume.

@ Marketplace information including equipment prices and spec such as hashrate, power,
energy consumption, regional availability.

4 Business Model <i MineBee

MineBee has established a number of mutually beneficial relationships with high-profile
partners in the mining rig monitoring and management industry. These partners will provide
MineBee with raw data collected from their extensive user base. MineBee will analyze this data
to improve the efficiency and safety of mining operations and license this information in order
to generate revenues for the company. Insights provided by MineBee Solution will offer the
users of MineBee partners a significant competitive advantage.

A high percentage of blockchain-based projects fail due to low user uptake. According to
research by ICOrating.com, in Q3 of 2018 “64% of all |COs failed to complete their
crowdfunding.” This can occur for anumber of reasons. The project may have an insufficient
addressable market, poor customer acquisition costs, or a subpar marketing strategy. With
such a high rate of failure, it is understandable that many teams expend huge amounts of
energy and resources building a platform and marketing in the hope of attracting users and
establishing a community to support their projects.

As a consequence, teams often become focused on user acquisition at the expense of
fundamental logistical implementation. Even those projects that successfully meet their
hardcap often fail further down the line. A 2018 Boston College study estimated that 55.8% of
all cryptocurrency related startups fail within 120 days of completion of their ICO.

To circumvent these issues, MineBee will license its software suite to established partners in
the mining industry. In doing so, MineBee will gain immediate access to a wide user base and
will enjoy strong support from launch. MineBee will onboard a substantial number of users
thanks to its partnership with MiningCom, a leading provider of rig management software.
The agreement will give MineBee access to an established community of users in exchange for
licensing its technology.

MineBee will also enjoy two other sources of revenue in the form of MineBee Contract and
MineBee Open Market. As a specialist market for new and used mining equipment, MineBee
Open Market will become an essential destination for anyone who wishes to trade in mining
equipment.

4.1 Expansion Strategy

MineBee’s research team has constructed a strategic marketing program that is backed by
market-specific analyses that will progressively expand MineBee’s operations on a region-by-
region basis. The MineBee team will actively work to develop the project through dual
marketing strategies that will run in parallel.

Commercial marketing campaign

In the first quarter of 2019, MineBee will initiate its commercial marketing campaign in Asia.
Its purpose will be to raise general awareness of the MineBee platform and its capabilities, to

34

4 Business Model Xi MineBee

improve overall utility, to increase data collection capacities, and to extend the MineBee
network. MineBee will extend its commercial marketing campaign globally in the fourth
quarter of 2019.

Partnership expansion campaign

In the second and third quarters of 2019, MineBee will initiate a partnership expansion
campaign in Asia. The primary focus of this initiative will be to raise corporate awareness of

4.2 Competitor Analysis

MineBee’s in-depth analysis of mining metrics will furnish cryptocurrency miners with an array
of performance-enhancing recommendations. Through intelligent analysis of big data,
MineBee will supply evidence-based optimizations that facilitate improvements above and
beyond anything supplied by existing mining management services. As a multi-faceted project
that straddles multiple sectors of the mining industry, MineBee’s competitors are equally
diverse, ranging from traditional marketplaces to mining management software developers.

Awesome Miner

Awesome Miner is a well-established provider of rig management software that shares some
functions with the MiningCom app. In particular, Awesome Miner is used to monitor the
progress, temperature and current status of mining rigs, and can also be used to control them.
Awesome Miner uses real-time data to determine which coin or mining pool may offer the best
profitability, but this information is supplied by third-party sources rather than being derived
directly.

eBay

Cryptocurrency miners are frequently bought and sold on eBay. However, as a non-specialist
market, is challenging to filter searches appropriately when dealing with highly technical
products such as mining rigs on eBay. Meanwhile, sellers are confronted by a basic selling fee
of at least 10% from the list value. This figure can rise with additional charges for reserve
pricing, and other auction types. eBay does not accept cryptocurrency, obliging miners to
liquidate their coins and convert into fiat before they can make a purchase.

GetMinera

GetMinera is a web-based front-end for mining operations, functioning as a mining controller
and data analysis tool. With system monitoring, notifications and controls, GetMinera has
certain similarities to the MiningCom app. GetMinera also offers guided system settings for its
users, assisting them in optimizing their operations. GetMinera is limited in scope, however,
existing as a bitcoin-only mining solution on Linux OS.

easyMINE

easyMine is a self-contained software platform that offers detailed real-time performance
monitoring and multiple mining engines. From one dashboard, multiple rigs can be analyzed
and monitored, including GPUs and ASICs. EasyMine is the only competitor to have its own
native token, but does not provide MineBee Solution-style data analysis.

CryptoGlance

CryptoGlance is an open-source coin mining operations monitoring and management webapp.
CryptoGlance provides users with detailed monitoring statistics and allows them to remotely
manage core functions, switch mining pools, reset components, track pool information, and
check wallet balances. Although CryptoGlance does feature remote monitoring functionality,
it lacks advanced big data driven analytics and, as such, lacks the value and efficiency-
generating insights provided by MineBee Solution.

While there are various platforms whose services overlap with MineBee, no other company
provides an all-in-one solution that enables miners to operate entirely within the
cryptocurrency ecosystem. The feature-rich and user-friendly components that make up the
MineBee service stack are suitable for beginners as well as more experienced miners and do
not require advanced knowledge to master.

5 Token Model Xi MineBee

The MB token is a dual discount and medium of exchange token used for purchasing services
from MineBee Solution. It also enables payments for P2P and B2C trades on MineBee Open
Market. A total of 5 billion ERC20 tokens will be minted in MineBee’s token generation event
(TGE).

When used as a payment token for MineBee Partners’ services, the MB token offers users a
discount on additional fees. With the option to purchase MineBee partners’ premium services
at reduced rates, users will have a strong incentive to acquire and use the MB token.

The strong network effects that will be exerted as the MineBee ecosystem grows will increase
demand for the MB token. This will be heightened by the increased mining efficiencies
demonstrated by MineBee Solution. The proven savings that MineBee’s insights can yield will
incentivize miners to purchase premium MineBee Solution services through MineBee’s partners.

While miners are at liberty to make purchases within the MineBee ecosystem using alternative
cryptocurrencies in the form of BTC and ETH, the significant discount bestowed by the
MB token will ensure it is the dominant cryptocurrency, particularly for MineBee Solution.

The mechanics of supply and demand mean that interest in the MB token can be expected to
rise, aided by the fact that there will be no additional tokens minted in future. MB’s fixed supply,
coupled with a steady influx of new users, will serve to accelerate interest in the token as the
sole mechanism for acquiring discounted access to MineBee Solution. This will also help to
reduce the token velocity problem which occurs in systems where participants have no
incentive to hold the token.

Since the MB token will provide discounted access to MineBee services, via its partners, in
perpetuity, holders will have strong economic incentives to retain and use the token for its
intended purpose. Given these factors, sustained transaction volume can be anticipated, while
the discount granted by MB will further mitigate velocity by giving the token intrinsic value in
the form of cash flows.

Once acquired by the community, tokens may be traded, exchanged, locked up or burned over
time. As MB enters general circulation, the token will become available via exchanges, or as
payment for products and services.

8 Glossary of Terms and Abbreviations Xi MineBee

Oui:

56

Hashing: using a mathematical function to derive a fixed length numeric or alphanumeric
string from a piece of data of any length.

Hashrate: a hashrate is the speed at which a computer can solve a hashing problem. The
probability of a miner successfully mining a block before anyone else is partially
determined by the hashrate of their mining operations.

Overclocking: overclocking is the process of increasing the working speed of a computer
or component beyond its original clock frequency specifications. This is typically
achieved by modifying system parameters or operating voltages. Overclocking is
typically performed by coin miners to improve the hashrate of their mining operations.

API: application programming interface.

Open API: publicly available application programming interface for third-parties to
integrate the MineBee Contract payment module.

ASIC: application-specific integrated circuit. A microchip designed specifically for
cryptocurrency mining.

GPU: graphics processing unit.
GUI: graphical user interface.
MOU: memorandum of understanding.

VGA: video graphics array.

9 Closing Statement Xi MineBee

The mining industry lacks a universal analytics and monitoring system. While other industries
have thrived on the insights that big data can supply, crypto miners have been deprived.
Inaccurate or insufficient data has prevented miners from optimizing their operations to
squeeze out greater efficiencies and from acquiring equipment at the best possible price.

MineBee’s complete solution will give cryptocurrency miners the tools they need to safely
increase hashrate and maximize uptime. As a result, GPU and ASIC miners will keep working
for longer, because their operations will be profitable for longer. During testing market
conditions, MineBee will be the difference between profit and loss, while in favorable
conditions, MineBee’s technology will significantly boost revenue. Smarter analysis begets
smarter mining.

As the number of miners sharing their performance data with MiningCom grows, the dataset
under analysis will increase commensurately. This will grant MineBee the ability to derive
improved insights on performance optimization and to facilitate new breakthroughs in
mining efficiency.

The MB token will grant discounted access to MineBee’s premium services, which will enable
miners to further increase their output. These optimizations will provide a clear cutting edge
from the moment they’re implemented. The MB token will also serve as the primary unit of
account on MineBee Open Market, enabling new and used equipment to be purchased
quickly and at competitive prices. The marketplace will provide a convenient entry and exit
strategy for miners to realize profits and then sell their equipment to the next wave of crypto
miners.

MineBee Open Market will also be supported by MineBee Contract, whose open API will
provide a payment solution suitable for all industries and businesses, including those
currently outside of the cryptocurrency space. This will further increase MineBee’s exposure
while yielding benefits for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Good data doesn’t lie and MineBee’s analytical approach to cryptocurrency mining will
provide the formula for success. Every new miner, mining pool, and mining management
service that connects to the MineBee ecosystem will further validate its data-driven model.

9 Closing Statement Xi MineBee

Proof of Work cryptocurrencies are widely regarded as the most secure means of validating
and decentralizing blockchains. The work that miners expend on confirming new
transactions and validating new blocks makes the cryptocurrency ecosystem stronger and
more valuable for everyone. MineBee and its partners are laying the framework for a data-
driven solution in which every participant prospers.

to your possession of this White Paper such part thereof (as the case may be) at your own
expense and without liability to MineBee. Persons to whom a copy of this White Paper has
been distributed or disseminated, provided access to or who otherwise have the White Paper
in their possession shall not circulate it to any other persons, reproduce or otherwise
distribute this White Paper or any information contained herein for any purpose whatsoever
not permit or cause the same to occur. The regulatory regime governing the blockchain
technologies, cryptocurrencies, tokens and token offerings such as MineBee technology and
the MB tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the
development of the MineBee technology and the utility of the MB tokens. Regulation of tokens
(including the MB tokens) and token offerings such as this, cryptocurrencies, blockchain
technologies, and cryptocurrency exchanges currently is undeveloped and likely to rapidly
evolve, varies significantly among international, federal, state and local jurisdictions and is
subject to significant uncertainty. Various legislative and executive bodies in the United States
and in other countries may in the future, adopt laws, regulations, guidance, or other actions,
which may severely impact the development and growth of the MineBee technology and the
adoption and utility of the MB tokens. Failure by MineBee or certain users of the MineBee
technology to comply with any laws, rules and regulations, some of which may not exist yet or
are subject to interpretation and may be subject to change, could result in a variety of adverse
consequences, including civil penalties and fines.

11.6

Blockchain networks also face an uncertain regulatory landscape in many non-U.S.
jurisdictions such as the European Union, China and Russia. Various non-U.S. jurisdictions
may, in the near future, adopt laws, regulations or directives that affect the MineBee
technology. Such laws, regulations or directives may conflict with those of the U.S. or may
directly and negatively impact the MineBee business. The effect of any future regulatory
change is impossible to predict, but such change could be substantial and materially adverse
to the development and growth of the MineBee technology and the adoption and utility of the
MB tokens. New or changing laws and regulations or interpretations of existing laws and

regulations, in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, may materially and adversely impact the value
of the ETH and BTC virtual currency or Fiat used to acquire MB tokens and otherwise materially
and adversely affect the structure or MB tokens and the rights of the holders of MB tokens.
Issuance of MB tokens May Constitute the Issuance of a “Security” Under U.S. Federal
Securities Laws 95 The MB token is a utility token that has a specific consumptive use - i.e., it
allows participants in the MineBee service to receive and pay value for data sharing by
individuals and entities, and make data available, on a distributed or non-distributed network
with significant advantages over current data sharing solutions. Due to the nature of the MB
tokens and the manner, in which they are being offered, we do not think they should be
considered “securities”, as that term is defined in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended

(the "Securities Act"). MB tokens might only be distributed to “accredited investors” as
defined in US securities laws and to not more than 150 non-qualified investors under the EU
Prospectus Regulation.

S PROBLEMS INVENTORS FACE

The start of 2020 is the start of a new decade that has to be
safer than before for those who make it through a unique and
innovative original work.

From the invention of the wheel to the discovery of oil to the
evolution of genetic engineering, there is essentially an idea that
inspired people to keep moving.

Every inventor has vision, mission, and aims that make that
person keep struggling. Most of the countries in the world aspire
to become knowledge-based economics and this cannot happen
without effective intellectual property protection.

All nations want to leverage effective intellectual
property standards to foster innovation and creativity
but achieving this goal is challenging and demanding.

The usage of technology can revolutionize and
modernize this domain. Here are the main categories of
protection:

v Patents:

~ Copyrights;

~ Trademarks;
~ Design Rights;
~ Trade Secrets.

The major issues all inventors face.

¥ Little to no Support: New and innovative ideas do not enjoy
much support. That is why innovators often have to make
things work without much support from their community.

The Risk of Idea Theft: Traditional ways of doing business are
subject to immense competition. That is why new ideas are
revered these days. New inventions are at risk of being
copied by unauthorized individuals.

Fewer Minds to Trust: Inventors work hard to invent
but cunning people can steal the concept
immediately. So the trust gap exists when it comes
to letting people know about innovation.

No Patent Information: People who want to file a
patient do not get enough details online. This makes
them go through a complicated and expensive
patent registration process.

Lack of Business Acumen: Being an expert in a field
is one thing and having the required business
acumen is quite another.

Loss of Focus on Actual Idea: There are many things
to take care of for an entrepreneur but losing focus
on the main idea can risk everything.

Shortage of Enough Funding: Patents cost insanely
and most inventors do not have enough funds to file
patents. In the absence of a patent, anyone can
steal the idea which can be suicidal for an
innovator.

When a tangible item gets stolen, the owner can provide
evidence to prove that the stolen item belonged to that person.
Stealing ideas is as bad as stealing tangible items are and that is
why it is punishable by law in most countries.

The inventor should be careful about the great work she or he
has done. It is important to take every step carefully. Several
steps should be taken by the innovator to establish a successful
business. The following points are crucial in making an invention
safe:

Legal Guidance: Inventors do not know the legal proceedings to
make their innovation secure. They need to get guidance from
experts who have gone through the same process.

SAFEGUARDING INVENTIONS

Hiring Skilled Talent: Coming up with an idea or just
developing a working prototype is not enough. An
innovator needs to bring the product or service to
market to commercialize. Hiring the right talent makes
this dream come true.

Intellectual Property: When a unique product or service
hits the market, certain risks threaten its future. To
make the future bright, intellectual property rights must
be registered with the authorities to avoid
infringements.

S SAFEGUARDING INVENTIONS

Marketing Strategies: Letting people know about a product or
service is one of the most important functions of a business. This
operation requires enough funds and inventions can stay safe by
spending on marketing, sales, and promotion operations.

Support from Experts: The people who have successfully
performed similar business operations can guide entrepreneurs
to help them head in the right direction despite all odds.

Timely Access to Funds: Funds are required to perform various
business operations and an innovator cannot put a business on
strong foundations without spending necessary funds when they
are needed.

©

One of the most prominent problems facing the inventor is the
absence of marketing skills. An inventor might be great at
inventing but that inventor may not know how marketing works.
To deal with this gap, the inventor needs a trustworthy entity
that can provide marketing advisory to market the invention.

The inventor also needs a specialized legal authority that can
legally assist the inventor in drafting the invention's
applications. More importantly, the inventor should take steps to
keep his copyright to the invention, especially, when drafting
contracts with businessmen on the other hand.

The innovator must be nurtured and provided with all types of
support. A dedicated organization can be hired for proper support
and guidance. This is important to encourage young people with
innovative ideas and talents. This way, innovators will start
trusting investors and businessmen.

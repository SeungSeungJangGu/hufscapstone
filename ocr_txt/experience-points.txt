THEEXPERIENCE BASED ECONOMY; ABROADER APPROACH

Abstract:

Since the earliest daysofboar and digitalgaming, experience po mts (XP)
have been the de facto curency of in-game life. Asa charactergoes
through theirnanow world, they gain XP which can be used to “levelup” and
impwve statistic s or func tion.

XP, the decentralized cryptocurency, aims to ntwduce this func tion into life
ina way that makes it both smple and imtuitive to build XP rewards into daily
living. Whe the rit is through the mec hanism of XP being givenasa rewand for
game play, asit would be used ina more conventional sense, or XP being
given asa componentof the gamification of reality, the practice of
awarding XP foruse in the realword presentsa tangible solution to some of
the poblemsendemic to today’ssome what abstract and disconnected

re ality. Tho ugh building thisbridge between a userseveryday life and the
blockc hain-based world of XP, a new and brighterfuture blending
cryptocunency and life canbe built.

Note for Experienced Cryptocunency Enthusiasts

As this pape ris de signed to not only introduce peope to XP, but also to
cryptocurency ingeneral some expenenced radersmay find certain
segments to be slow-going, boring, orove ry simplified. Because of the

important that non-crypto peopk canread and understand what is
proposed by the XP Development Team. Many of the ideas pr sented in this

L Why XP?

The true value ofa life isn’t measured in money orm age orm things — life is
measured in experience. A life welllived is filed with infinite grinsof
experience that set it apart from every other. Living to the ripe old age of 100
yearsina bubble isno life atal, but going outina blaze of glory n yourmid-
20s while doing something amazing can be considered a “life welllived.”
While not advocating the mid-20s blaze of glory path, there is something to
be said forexperience. Life ismeantto be lived — fully.

Everything we do in life gives usexperience. Fach trip we take, each concert
we attend, and each new friend we meet, contrbutes to the etemal
distributed ledgerofourlves. Why not use thisexperience? Why not find a
way to account foritand to make it work forusas we go through life? Why
not meet with others, who also have experience, and share another unique
experience together. This shanng economy ofexpenence is what XPwas
created to facilitate .

The centralrequie ment of XP is that it is fore ve ryone. Unlike other
cryptocurencies that have a specific and very nanow usage, XPisdesigned
to be used by anyone, anywhere. With a mechanism thatcan pwvide a
degree of distribution impossible with othercryptoc unencies, XPcan
enhance yourlife and brng youcloserto the experence-driven community.
Unlike othercryptoc urencies which must be purchased ormined, XPcan be
made available to you as you build experience. XPisone of life’s tny rewards
that you getfora job welldone ora new experience tucked away. XPopens
the potentialforan entire economy based on what you have done, where
you have gone, and the communities with which you engage.

Before we begin, it isimportant forpotential users to understand the use case
of XP. With most cryptoc une ncies, the use case is hypothe tic al Often, this use
case itselfisindevelopmentand it MAYbe available foruse atsome pointin
time in the future. With XP, the use case already exists, because people are
out there in the world building experience every single day.

The term XP was first used by Gygax, Kaye, and Blume, the orginalcreatosof
Dungeonsand Dragons.! Since that time hasbecome ubiquitous in many
diffe rent areas of life. The trend towards gamific ation has allowed the
conceptof “experience points,” once reserved forgames, to spread into
tasks from doing yourlaundry to walking yourdog. XP seeks to capitalize on
this by providing an inc entiviza tion structure to permit the free flow of tokens
from generation points to usersand back to spending partners.

1 First mentioned in the First Edition of the Dungeons and Dragons Basic Set in 1977.

IL Understanding Market Sizing

There isa large contingent of the cryptocunency investment community
which associates the price ofa cryptocunenc y with its supply. Ho we ver, this
logic issome what faulty, as it isn’t necessarily the supply ofa token which
determines its price, butratherdemand and usage. We are dedicated to
building that demand and creating that usage.

And now forsome briefnotes about market sizing:

In Gaming:
e hh 2016, gaming represented a total market valuation of US$99.6 billion,
with an 8.5% gw wth rate over 2015?
e 58% ofallgrowth in gaming in 2016 occured in the Asia-Pacific Region

In Tourism:
e Ih Euwpe, tousand activities account foraround US$40 billion

e Travelers are likely to spend more on sightseeing and building
experience than on shopping, souvenirs and nightlife combined?

In Ente rtainment:

What is XP?

XP, ore Xperience Points, isa Pwof-of-Stake cryptocunency. Since XP is
designed to be used bya much bwaderaudience, it would do wellto spend
some time explaining exactly what thismeans. While much deeper
explanationscan be found in many different locations online, a brief hyper
condensed explanation of exactly whata cryptocunency isand how itis
generated follows.

The fust cryptocunrency, Bitcoin, wasdeveloped bya person, orperons,

kno wn as Satoshi Nakamoto. Thiscryptoc urency, in a stro ke, re vo lutio nized
the financial world. One characteristic that makescryptoc unency so

re vo lutio nary isbecause it removes the require ment forfaith in a financial
system. Fyou have a dolarin yourwalet, you know that dolarwilbuy youa
set amount ofbread orwater. You know this because that dollarisbacked
by the Federal Reserve Bankof the United States, which is, n tum, backed by
the United States Govemmentand everything that entails.

Ho we vey, history has taught usagain and again that banks fail govemments
collapse, localized computersystems fail, and operatorenvorcan wipe out
the financialrecords of millions. With decentralized c urencies, this isn’t
possible. With cryptocurency, youdon’tneed to trust any single personor
organization, nstead youcan know, with mathematic alcertainty, that your
deposits are secured and protected by the entire distrbuted network.

Pwo o f-o f- Wo rk (Po W) currencies rely oncomputers to perform complex
calculation to secure the network. While this seemed like a good idea at the
advent ofcryptocunencies, as diffic ulty inc reases it is becoming clearthat it
is envio nmenta lly ive sponsible and wholly unnecessary to rely on these sorts
of arbitrary calculations to generate new tokensorto secure the network.

Asa replacement for Po W, XP usesa system known as Pwof-o f-Stake (PoS) to
defend the network. Thisalso makes the generation of tokens possible by
anyone who maintainsa coin balance and keeps theircomputeron; itdoes
not require a powerfulcomputerorexpensive GPUs to “mine” coins.

Fo m a network sec urity perspec tive, thismakesa difference aswell As
computing poweradvancesand quantum computers begin to edge their
way outof theory and into actualusage, POoWcunenciesare going to
become much lessreliable asthe sec urity of the network dependson no
single actorbeing able to contwla majority of the processing powerbeing
used. In the event that one state actormakesan advance in quantum
piwcessing, it would be possible forthis state actorto attack the very cor of
Po W cunrencies. On the otherhand, in onerto destabilize the network witha
PoScunency, it isnecessary forthe hostile actorto contwlover50% of the
available coin supp\. This is much less like ly than someone attempting to
successfully destabilize a Po W network.
The Economics of Digital lyken- Based System

Due to the fact that it isourlong-term goalto push XP out into the world and
beyond the cryptocunenc y community, it is important that we address some
ofthe fundamentalconcems presented by the uninitiated. Thissegment was
bome outofa disc ussion with se ve ralbankers who raised several points
about which they were concemed.

‘The Liquidity Problem: This issue, as ithas been thus termed for Bitc oin, is

esse ntia lly the challenges facing conversion fom Bitcoin to more easily
usable fiat cure nc y. This pwblem of the essential fungibility hasbeen dealt
with, in large part, by the growth of the market. fF viewed asan investment
instrument, such asa bond, then the conversion of Bitcoin to cash presents
baners no greaterthan a certificate of depositorany otherpaper-based
asset. However, if viewed asa store of value and curency in its o wn right,
cryptocurrency doesn’t need to be “converted,” it simply needs to be used.
Around the world, itisbecoming more and mor possible to USE
cryptocunency without being concemed about the fundamentalability to
instantly convert to fiat. hn many ways, cryptocurrencies presenta great
opportunity of global func tio na lity which nationalcunenciesdo not possess.

That said, if you must convert a cryptocunency to cash, there are:
e Cryptocumre nc y exchanges which can diect deposit funds into
yourbankaccount based oncryptocunency deposits
e Crypto-based banking institutions
e = Bitcoin ATMs orotherautomated banking servicesavailable to
cryptocunency users

Decentralization and the Lack of Oversight: This is an issue of specialconcem
to many financ ialexperts. Ther isa greatneed amongst adherents to the
fina nc ial institutions of today forsome sort of centralization and contwl The
fearis that without centralized controland oversight, there can be no sortof
Ke yne sian economic conti ls exerted on the system. While this is tec hnic a ly
tue with most cryptocunency systems, most cryptocurency users would
consider this very mucha feature, and nota bug. Having state-sponsored
oversight guarantees only that meddling willoccur. The system cannot be

se lf-comecting because market conditions often actin opposition to attempts
to contwlthe market creating a negative oscilatory cycle.

Cryptocunencies DO lacka centralcontmwlsystem, but that also means that
they cannotbe manipulated outside ofthe application of market fores. ‘This
isa double-edged swom because on one hand it means that the users

the mse lves retain controlovertheiro wn resources. On the otherhand, it
means that market forresC AN be used to lead to market move ments. This is
no different than the more standand financ ialmodels, but the scale of many
cryptocunencies mean that itiseasierto move the value ofcryptocunencies
than it isto move the value of, forexample, the dolar. Lisexpected thatas
usage increasesand a token such as XP moves fwm the hands of those who

6|Page
speculate to the handsof those who actually use the token, these
fluc tua tions wildecrease, and a market equilibrum willbe achieved based
on gwwth and usage.

Black Market Usage: I has often been said by critics that the only reason
cryptoc une ncies exist isto conduct black market transac tions. While this is
certainly possible, cash and metals wilalwaysbe king forlarge-scale illic it
transac tions. The very fact that transac tions exists on a bloc kc hain which is
immutable and a permanent recon that movement has taken place makes
bloc kc hain transac tions unattrac tive foranything ilegalona large scale.
Bloc kc hain forensics isa growing area of law enforement interest, and the
days of using cryptocunenciesto move large amountsofmoney completely
undetected are coming to anend.

The State of XP Today

The XP community has raised severalconcemsregardiing XP’s fundamental
technology and market distrb ution. There is often comments about reducing
totalsup ply, reducing stake rate (the fist stage of which hasbeen done with
the December 25. 2017 Wallet Release), and large wallets held by previous
team members. While a great dealcould be said about these issues, it is best
to simply present the solution.

Allof these issuescan be effectively managed through the intw duction of
the XP Pentanode System. Ratherthan relying on simple staking forthe
security of the network, XP wilrely on five different typesof specialized nodes
to provide network security and the verification of transac tions. h addition to
receiving various annualretums, the nodes willalso send a perwentage of
theirstake rewardsbackto the XP Foundation to be used to grww the
networkorto be bumtin a transparent and auditable fashion.

NOTE: The XP Pentanode System cure ntly proposed has been input into the
Offic ial 2018 XP Roadmap. Howe ver, as development continue s, the se de tails
may change.

XP Maste modes (Cost: 50m XP)
These are standard investment-grade Mastemodes, paying out at
vo ug hly 50% annually. h onderto guarantee uptime, stakes wiloccur
every 60 minutes afterthe node hasbeen active. Annualeamings
assume a 24/7 uptime, with bonuses being distributed to nodes for
being up and staking forthe longest period of time. Foreach hour
staking, these nodes willreceive appwximate ly 2,800 XP. The nodes will
be configured so that t doesn’t matter whetherthe node holds50m or
500m, the payment willbe the same. This inc entivizes the creation of
new nodesand disinc entivizes hoarding.

7|Page
XP Supe modes (Cost: 1b XP)
XP understands that people would like to gain higherretums forthe
service of securing the networkand keeping tokens out of cir ulation.
h light of this, we wilbe creating the XP Supemode. Thisnode will
require a much higherinitialde posit, but wil stake ata much higher
rate. n exchange for this higher staking rate, there willbe a one-week
delay before the node canbe bwken.

Furthe more, the creation ofa supemode willresultin a permanent
bum of the coins used to establish the node. While it will still receive

vw ughly 200% of the initial 1 bilion XP deposit annually, the fist bilion
has been dest yed. Thismeans that afterthe purchase of the
Supemode, it will take roughly six months to be able to break the node
without losing a percentage of funds.

These two innovations will prevent the opportunistic dumping of high
token volumes when price targets are reached. This feature will

e sse ntia lly imit Supe modesto those who believe in the prwojectand are
willing to support it with theirc ontinualserice of network sec urity.

XP Sale snodes
hh orderto gww the XP network, it isnecessary to bring merc hants
willing to both accept XPand pwvide XP to theirc usto mews. This is vital
to onboarding new users and introducing them to the XPeconomy.
This simple economic reality necessitates the creation of the Retail
Sale snode. The vast majority of people spending money today are not
familiar with cryptoc unenc y in any meaning ful sense. Certainly, they
have heard about various cryptocurency prwjects, but
cryptocunency hasa magicalunreality to it.

hh order to facilitate the spread of the XPeconomy, the XP Foundation
willcreate and distribute XP Salesnodes to re taile rs/ sho po wners who
would like to eitheraccept XPorto use it forpro motional purposes. The
Sale snode will func tion exac tly like a Mastemode with one critical
difference — while a Mastemode can be bwken up and sold at its
holders whim ortransfermed, a Salesnode cannot be broken up orsold.
The stake rewards fom thisnode can be used pr motionall, as rains,
orin any way that the merc hant can devise. However, it will only stake
to 150% of the initialde posit. This preventsa dormant orlightly used
Sale snode from continuing to stake when not being used. The
Salesnode itselfalso servesasa point-of-sale inte gration system,
allowing the main wallet to be used justasa nomalwaletforsales
purposes, keeping the staking portion of the node segregated from
the daily balance forusage.

ih the event that the merc hant decides to no longerpartic ipate in the
XP network, the coins willbe func tionaly bumt and can be removed

from the totalsupply. In fact, the creation of the salesnode, forall

8|Page
intents and purposes, func tionsasa coin bum. This means that for
every single merc hant partner that joins the XP network, the totalcon
supply isreduced by a setnumber, while the sec urity of the networkis
maintained. This wil mean that there canbe a DIRECTconelation
between merchant signupsand market price.

Devnodes
Unlike theirre latives, the Re tailSalesnodes, Application De vnodes exist
to facilitate online growth of the XPeconomy. These Devnodesare
pwvided, free of charge, to developers. They stake ata very high rate,
but operate ona 10-day moving average coinbum. Esse ntia ly, if a
developerhasa game thatisvery popular, it is vitalto be able to
piwvide XP to be rained into theirecosystem. However, to prevent
accumulation ormanipulation, these nodes wilbum coins that have
not been used afterten days. These nodescan only be accessed
thro ugh the to-be-created XPlay APJ and are otherwise inaccessible.
like the Re tailSalesnodes, they function asa con bum whencreated,
and cannotbe bwken and sold. Like wise, theirstaked coinscannot
be direc tly accessed, but only distributed using the XPlay API

Geonodes
One of the critic al diffe re ntiating features that XPcan offerto the
world, is the ability forusers to gain XP simply by visiting certain
locations. Using the andrwid-based XP wallet, with planned iPhone
inte gration in the future, userscan activate location trac king on their
wallets, which willenable them to receive geolocation based rains.

This works by making it possible fora retaillocation,a monumentora
museum to offerexperience points to theirvisitors by simply notifying
them that experience points are available and offermg a QRceode for
them to download the wallet.

Imagine being able to attend a concert—As you listen to the music,
yourphone rceivesa rain of XP fom a localprwmotional partner. You
are then able to tum around and use this XP to buy re freshments fom
an XP affiliated retailer. The possibilities are endless with Geonodesand
XP is the fist crypto curency to offer this feature.

‘The XP Foundation Mothe mode:
While nota staking node and while serving a very different purpose,
the XP Mothe mode is the centraland auditable clearing house forthe
stake percentages retumed to The XP Foundation. The XP Mothemode
serves primarily forthe creation of the preceding node types (with the
exception of Mastemodesand Supemodes). The XP Mothemode is
entire ly transparent and canbe audited by anyone. Tb fund thisnode,
a portion ofallstake rewards are sent backto the XP Foundation
Mothe mode to be used in ecosystem gw wth.

VI

This node func tionsona 30-day moving average and bumsall tokens
which have been sent it they have not been used in 30 days. This
prevents accumulation by the development team and altogether
avoids the problem created by previous developers.

The continuous bum will prevent undue supply inflation, but willalso
allow forthe creation of RetailSalesnodesand Application Devnodes
asneeded to onboan new rtaillocationsand developers.

A Brighter Future with XP

The criticalwadblock forallcryptocunency units today is answering the
question of how to drive adoption. Curently, to buy XP, a userhas several
avenues, but most of them involve buying some crypto ofone sortoranother
and moving itto anexchange to buy some XP. This is not sustainable and
locks out the vast majority of potential users who are uncomfortable with
cryptocurency in general, and are abjec tly temified of exchanges, with allof
theirelaborate bells, whistles, candles, and unfamiliarterminology.

The solution to thisisto create an ecosystem thatisbased ona regular
distrib ution of tokens in amounts that inc entivize userengagement while not
over-inflating the curency ordisinc entivizing purc haseson exchanges by the
investorc lass. The overallidea isto help people see the utility of XP, so that
they wilgo outon theirown to acquire more —eitherby supporting XP

a ffilia tes or through purchasing XPon an exchange.

Thiscan be done ina variety of ways:

The mostreliable source of XP forthe average usershould alwaysbe the
holdersof the Salesnode and Devnodes. Asa cunency, we serve more than
one purpose; in addition to serving asa medium ofexchange, XP servesas
an able vehicle of inc entivization forc ustomers, clients, and visitors
everywhere.

Salesnodes: While there are hundredsof use cases, considerthese few
examples of holder of Salesnodes using them to grw theirbusinesses.

Meet BloodyEwe - BloodyEwe operates xp.market and uses it to sell
Steam codesand other XP-re lated mer handise (really! Go checkit
out!). In addition to selling these codes, he would like to be able to
establish a re ferralsystem so that when someone sends their friends to
buy Steam codes with XP, BloodyHwe can give some XPback to the
referer.

Meet Jan - Janisa travelagent who uses XP to inc entivize spec ific
trips. The Salesnode enables Jan to func tionally give discounts on a trip
while not negatively impacting herbottom line. Jan recently gave 50m
XP to Barclay forthe purchase ofa trip to Thailand, and also provided

10| Page
him with a listofretaillocationsand places where XPcan be spent.
The XP was sent to Bar lay’s XP Mobile Wallet where he willbe able to
spend kat participating retailersin Bangkok.

Meet Hugo - Hugo isa cutting-edge chef in New York City. He believes
thata mealat his restaurant should be an experence. h light of this,
he was delighted to discoverthat he could setup a retailsalesnode in
his re sta urant. Now, at the bottom ofeach of hisreceipts, a private key
is printed which allows hisc ustomers to rdeem XP. When you
experience his fusion take on chicken Cordon Bleu you get 1000 XPas
a reminderof your visit.

Meet Htet Oo - Htet Oo operatesanelephant tourcompany located
in the junglesof Myanmar. He is thriled to run a retailsalesnode
because it gives him the opportunity to attract inte mationalc ustomers
who are interested in touring the world and using XP. Foreach of his
elephant rides, for which he receives XP, a more stable altemative to
the Burmese Kyat, he offers XP in exchange forsocialmedia postson
his customers Facebook, Twitter, and hstagram accounts. He operates
both a retailsalesnode, and hisown personalmasternode. He also
uses hismobile wallet to pay guidesand service pwvider along his
tour utes.

Devnodes: As our digital lives grow, there ismuch we willbe able to do in
terms of digitalc ontent delivery and digital life integration. While the
following casescould apply rght now, more and mor use cases spring into
existence daily.

Meet The PnkCrypto - The PnkCrypto operatesa chatroom and wants
to use XPasan in-chat tipping cunency. Tb facilitate this, the XP
foundation pw vides her with an application Devnode, which prwvides
some degree of liquidity forrains, thereby inc entivizing c hannel
participation, but also actsasan additional sec urity node on the
network.

Meet loopylew113 - Loopylew is the developerof Forest Sege,an
indie game available on itch.io. He usesan application Devnode in
fore st siege because italows him to rain XP on players for performing
specific tasks within the game. Thisconnectsdiectly to an in-game
wallet, which willenable players to store XP to purc hase in-game
items, orsend the XP to theirown core wallet. As time goeson he
intends on building an entirely enclosed marketplace based on XP
within the forest siege game.

Meet Yaneli- Yaneliisan app developerwho focuseson the creation
of health-based applications. h exchange forusing hermealplanning
application, usersare awarded XP foreach item they enterinto their
daily meal plan. This XP inc entivizes people to use herapplications,

1l1| Page
making them mor attractive in an open market. However, it also
makes herapplications much more effec tive because of the effect
that the positive enforcement fom gamific ation o ffers.

Meet Fon - Fon isa developerforan online education based website,
at which studentscan sign up forc lasses, watch videos, and
participate in online forum disc ussions. By maintaining an application
Devnode, Fon can pwvide experience points to herend-usew. Fyou
sign up to take herclasson blockchain technology, you wilreceive 5
milion XPoncompletion.

Geonodes: The fist geographic ally-based cryptocunency rwan system
givesthe average usera way to eam XP without having to spend anything at
allto purchase XP, but stillc ontrbutes to the ecosystem by patronizing local
landmarks such as those below.

Meet John Harvard - The famous statue of John Harvaw sits in the
quad at Harvard College. Asa sortofmecca forthose seeking Wy
league acceptances, the figure of John Harvand isa frequent
location visited by hundreds of thousands of people every year. With
an XP Geonode, an educationalc onsultancy can rain XP on visitors to
the statue of John Harvaw. These visitors, can in tum use XP at various
locations thw ug ho ut Boston and around the world.

Meet Big Ben - No postcard of london would be complete without the
iconic image of Big Ben looming in the background. A tourcompany
in londoncould identify a specific location foran XP Geonode, which
would rain XP on visitors who came to take photos with Big Ben in the
background. This XP could then be used to purchase discountson
double-deckerbus rides thw ughout london, pwvided by the same
touroperator.

Meet Mount Everest - one unique feature which willbe available for
use with Geonodesis the conceptof scarcity. A location, suchas
Central Park, which is frequented by milionsof people every year,
might yield very little in the way of XP rains. However, a location which
isalmost nevervisited would be permitted to accumulate a much
more extensive store of XP, which would conespond to how much
work is needed to reach the Geonode. the fist person to unfurlan XP
flag on the summit of Mount Everest and access the Geonode ther,
would undoubtedly rceive a fantastic r ward, both rgaming actual
human experience and XP.

Meet New York City —anotherunique feature that would support
Geonode distribution is the use of “GeoDwps.” These dwps would
enable usersora company to establish XP Dwp Points at any point
geographically where they could be displayed ona map, bringing
members ofthe XPcommunity into range to attempt to collect the XP.

12| Page
hh terms of market sizing, thishas the potentialto make Pokemon Go,
which has revenues of $268 million as of August 12%, 201779, look tiny by
comparison.

Inte grating Advertismg with the XP Network using Geonodes: The primary
goalof XPhasalwaysbeen to attempt to find a way to incentivize what is
good in the human experience, and reward people fortherinvolvementina
broaderglobalextra national network. XP isc ontinuo usly looking for ways to
enhance ourofferngs to humanity. One such way we can do thisis though
leveraging the XP network to fund various soc ialand enviwnmental pi jec ts.
The way that we do thisis by offering advertising placement in the XP Mobile
Wallet which isbased on the geographic location of an XP user"! ‘his will
make it possible forthe XP Foundation to selladvertismg space to hand
selected companiesand directa large portion of the pwceeds fwm this
advertising to preservation efforts. Forexample, an XP userin Yosemite
National Park may receive an advertisement for North face apparel,
partnered with min fom a Geonode. Forthe first time, thiscreatesa
mechanism that both allows the delivery of advertising content to the end-
use r, inc entivizes the end-userto acknowledge the advertisng company,
and simultaneously works to preserve the National Park system with
advertisng revenue. Thisconceptis stil underdevelopment, and willbe
explored in greaterdepthina laterpublication.

VIL Conclusion

This is just the beginning of what XPcan accomplish. 2018 isto be a yearof
capacity building and ecosystem growth. The XP am looks forward to the
continued support ofthe XP Community as we work to make XP the world’s
premiere xperience-based curency in gaming, sports, academics, and every
otherarea of life.

XP: Do it forthe experience!

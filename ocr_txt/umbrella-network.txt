Umbrella Network is a community owned, decentralized oracle service
providing secure, low cost, and massively scalable data solutions to
decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

Umbrella provides access to data previously unavailable to blockchain
developers across multiple segments including mid and long tail crypto
assets as well as real world financial data.

At the center of the Umbrella Network is the SUMB token. It helps in
securing the network and is used by the community to stake, vote on
key decisions, and earn rewards & user fees.

Umbrella solves the scalability problem in oracles by leveraging a layer
2 solution and utilizing merkle trees for batching transactions. The
network is community owned and governed with the majority of token
supply allocated to the community.

Our goals at Umbrella Network:

Create an oracle with a decentralized network
invulnerable to influence, manipulation, or attack.

Offer a low-cost data solution that promotes high volume scalability
as well as wider adoption and diversification of data offerings.

Create a truly decentralized network that is owned by a
community who retains governance while keeping incentives
in place to reward early contributors for their efforts.
TECHNICAL
ARCHITECTURE

The technical architecture of Umbrella Network
ensures that only cryptographically verified and
economically incentivized truthful data,

is available to users.

The cryptographic proofs are stored on the Layer 1 blockchain such
that the user can query at any time for pricing data and can verify that
the pricing on Layer 1 is correct with the help of cryptographic proofs.
This allows data to be streamed onto Layer 2 while guaranteeing to be
cryptographically correct.

This is possible because the hash of the data will always correspond to

a unique hash value. If even one character changes within that data, the
entire hash value changes. When there is a lot of data, storing all of it is

not possible on Layer 1, hence Umbrella aggregates and processes that
first on Layer 2, ensuring that we are able to provide the required data

ina way which is still efficiently fast, inexpensive, and where the data

remains verifiably correct and unaltered.

Umbrella’s nodes pull data from various APIs and arrive at consensus
via an on chain smart contract. Our solution uses Merkle Trees to allow
nodes to validate thousands of transactions for the price of a single
transaction.
THE PLATFORM -
MERKLE TREES

Umbrella is able to achieve scalability via
an innovation called the Merkle tree.

A Merkle tree, or binary hash tree, is a data structure that allows efficient
and secure verification of large amounts of data. They help to ensure
that data blocks received from other peers in any peer-to-peer network
is received undamaged and unaltered. Using Merkle trees, decentralized
applications can bring thousands of real-world data points on chain at a
low cost without sacrificing security or data integrity.

For blockchain transactions, Merkle trees help organize data that makes
the verification process use less computational resources.

Top Hash Let's focus on the diagram to the left.

Each leaf (L1-L4) on the Merkle Tree represents a
data point from an oracle. The leaves are rolled from
the lowest leaf up to the Root Hash. The final Root
Hash 1-0 Hash is a unique identifier for the entire block of

Hash 11 transactions contained within the merkle tree.

A proof of stake consensus is conducted on the
Root Hash representing all the data in the tree, and
the final validated set of transactions are written on
chain for the cost of one transaction fee.

Data blocks
THE PLATFORM -

Umbrella Network
has primarily
two types of data:

Data that is always available on chain. These tend
to be some of the most frequently used data sets
including top crypto pairs, top crypto-fiat pairs
and some of the most popular data feeds from
our developers such as implied volatility for BTC
and ETH. Majority of the current large oracles
work with FCD.

is a rich and full data set for crypto pairs, indexes,
implied and realized volatility, and much more.
These data pairs are anchored to Layer 1 using
Merkle trees and are very fast and scalable.

Umbrella will make 84 of the most commonly
used crypto data pairs available on our
Layer 2 system for free.

Furthermore, we will provide more than 50 of
the most common data pairs on the chain
updated frequently, once again for free, to all
developers. These will include Fiat Pairs, Crypto
Pairs, Implied and Realized Volatility and Indexes
like the DeFi Pulse Index, among others.
THE PLATFORM -

VALIDATOR REGISTRY,
STAKING BANK, & THE CHAIN

Node operators are called “validators”

within the Umbrella Network.

Validator Registry

The contract owner manages the
validators within the validator
registry and can add or remove
validators at their discretion.
Each validator is prescribed a set
of properties, including name,
Ethereum public address, and
the HTTP(S) location of a node.

Staking Bank

In order to validate data,
validators first must deposit
tokens into what's called a
staking bank. During consensus,
the weight of each validator’s
vote is determined by the
amount of tokens they have
staked. Because Umbrella uses a
Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
consensus algorithm, delegators

can choose the validators who
will cast votes on their behalf.

The Chain

Once consensus is initiated, a
validator leader (the leader is
randomly computed based on
the number of validators) first
retrieves results from HTTP(S)
requests and builds a block. The
validator then presents the
blocks to other validators, who
double-check the block by
independently executing the
HTTP(S) requests and verifying
the leader’s results.

If the block’s results are accurate,
the validator leader signs the block.

In order to be accepted by the
chain contract, a majority validator
stake must sign off on the block.
Umbrella utilizes a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) that benefits from
the active participation of the community and token holders.

UMB Utility Token holders will:

Select Validator Participate in Stake tokens in Generate rewards
Nodes governance consensus rounds for staking tokens

The DPoS system puts the power in the hands of UMB holders to
select Validator Nodes who participate in the consensus process of
determining market data.

UMB holders are incentivized to select the best Validator Nodes
hat are the most likely to consistently vote in the majority in
consensus rounds. Their tokens will be used by the Validator Nodes
in the staking process. In addition, they will receive a portion of the
user fees paid to their elected Validator Node. UMB holders that
stake their tokens with a Validator Node will receive rewards in the
orm of vested or unvested forms of UMB tokens.

THE PLATFORM -
VALIDATOR POOLS

By participating in Validator Pools, UMB holders

can generate yield on their UMB holdings.

They will receive a pro-rata share of fees paid by developers using the

Umbrella Network — net of any direct costs.

Alternatively, the rewards are triggered on a specified
timeline (i.e. 1 year) if the business milestones are not
yet achieved by the specified timeline. There will be 4
milestones which are primarily based on the number
of data requests made for Umbrella Oracle data.

First milestone round, Milestone 1.

Umbrella will generate 111,872 rUMB' everyday after
launch. rUMB' will be redeemable for 1 UMB when
certain business milestones are reached or 1 year
from the start of Milestone 1. Each day, a maximum
of 223,744 rUMB' can be exchanged for UMB. This
rUMB' for UMB exchange process will take 6
months or less.

Second milestone round, Milestone 2.

Will mirror the first. The main difference is that
rUMB? for Milestone 2 will be issued each day until
business milestones are reached or 1 year from the
start of Milestone 2. Once milestones are reached
or time expires, up to 223,744 rUMB? will be
redeemable for UMB. Same as for Milestone 1, this
Milestone 2 rUMB? for the UMB exchange process
will take 6 months or less.

Milestones 3 and 4 will follow the same formula.

ABSTRACT

In order to create “quantum-proof’ peer to peer addresses, the SHIELD protocol will
replace ECDS with Lamport, Winternitz or BLISS signatures. To facilitate the continual
development of the SHIELD protocol, as well as other projects specified in this document,
SHIELD will be subject to a self-supporting development cycle.

The SHIELD currency will further distinguish itself with the implementation of a custom
PoS scheme (PoS Boo) operating on a network of Masternodes, the activation of these
masternodes will also enable enhanced transaction capabilities such as PrivateSend and
InstantSend.

Keywords:

SHIELD, quantum-proof, masternodes, cryptocurrency, blockchain, privacy SHIELD
currency, Lamport signatures, Winternitz signatures, BLISS signatures.
1. INTRODUCTION

SHIELD is a cryptocurrency based on the blockchain technology developed by Satoshi
Nakamoto in 2009.

Since the blockchain’s genesis, blockchain technology has seen exponential growth
and application across a variety of industries, however, the blockchain still faces many
critical challenges that must be addressed and overcome before mainstream adoption can
be achieved. SHIELD intends to solve these problems by creating the first truly secure,
anonymous peer to peer cryptocurrency, resistant to both 51% attacks and the future
threat posed by quantum computing, while maintaining unparalleled transaction times with
minimal accompanying fees.

2. PROBLEMS TO SOLVE

When Bitcoin was first introduced, Bitcoin was regarded as an innovative technological
breakthrough. This is exemplified in that much of the fundamentals of what Satoshi
created can still be found at the core of many cryptocurrencies developed today. One such
fundamental is block mining, or more specifically, block mining with one single algorithm.
This aspect of blockchain technology has led to the development of specialised hardware
(ASICs) that have the ability to hash one algorithm to an extreme level of effectiveness,
rendering GPU mining obsolete. The drawback of development design decisions made by
Satoshi, as many cryptocurrencies have since come to realize, is that mining is not always
a “fair? process for all participants. Further information can be found in ‘Section 3:
Multi-Algorithm PoW Mining’.

Quantum computers have become increasingly sophisticated in recent years and will
likely be made available to the public in the near future. Whether these quantum
computers will be restricted to research groups, governments, industry or made accessible
to the general public, quantum computing will eventually become available to individuals
with nefarious self-interests. While this technology will undoubtedly greatly improve the
lives of many, there are many legitimate reasons to be concerned with its increasing
availability. One such reason is the vulnerability found in modern-day cryptography
allowing them to be efficiently cracked by future quantum computers. For many
cryptocurrencies, this advance in computing ability could create an effectively inoperative
blockchain. How the SHIELD currency will address this problem is outlined in ‘Section 4:
Quantum Resistance’.

Industry dominant corporations such as Facebook and Google have become
increasingly effective at knowing who their users are, and what their users want. While this
may not currently be a major concern to the majority of the general public, this pervasive
2

trend has created a world in which organisations can watch, evaluate and track both
existing and potential consumers. Currently, there are multiple existing cryptocurrencies
that claim to keep their users anonymous, such technology would prevent both
corporations and governments from being able to track your spending habits. The problem
with the vast majority of cryptocurrencies, is that they are not nearly as effective at
maintaining user anonymity as they claim. This results in scalability and practicability
which is low, or at times, non-existent. We will talk more about maintaining user anonymity
in ‘Section 5: Privacy Features’.

Many competing cryptocurrencies available today contain promising roadmaps, and
some alternative cryptocurrencies even have incredibly talented, creative developers.
Unfortunately, without funding, many of these coins will never see the completion of their
projected goals and mission. Without a constant income stream produced by the project,
maintaining a full-time development team can become increasingly difficult. This is the last
thing we want at SHIELD, as we truly believe in our mission, our objectives, and our
commitment to the SHIELD community. In order to counteract the funding problems
commonly faced by many cryptocurrency projects, we intend to implement features to
SHIELD (and platforms around SHIELD) that can assist us with funding. You can read
further about our innovative funding solution in ‘Section 6: Funding’.

Another problem we have identified is the increasingly high power consumption
required by miners to allow coin minting and transaction confirmation through the ‘Proof of
Work’ (PoW) protocols that Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies currently utilise. PoW
was innovative in 2009 when Bitcoin was conceived, and still achieves the intended
purpose for currencies today, unfortunately, the economic and environmental cost of the
continued use of blockchains that rely on PoW protocols for network consensus is
extremely high, and growing at an exponential rate. This problem is efficiently solved with
our Proof of Stake scheme, which you can read about in ‘Section 9: PoS Boo’.
3. MULTI-ALGORITHM PoW MINING

Through the use of multiple PoW algorithms, SHIELD has improved upon the
blockchains equal distribution of rewards as well as the ability to resist a 51% attack.
Multi-algorithm mining provides a method of allowing multiple and varied types of
processing units to mine for blocks; our approach enables both GPUs and ASICs to mine
together in harmony on the SHIELD blockchain. The distribution of rewards per algorithm
is consistently proportionate to the total block reward over time.

For example, should the x17 algorithm accumulate 300GH/s of network hash, while the
blake2s algorithm accumulates only 50MH/s, both algorithms will receive the same
number of coins per hour. This system improves 51% attack prevention due to the fair and
equal nature of block distribution; each algorithm follows its own “schedule”, meaning 51%
of the hashing rate is needed for each algorithm to succeed in executing such an attack.

An integral element of this multi-algorithm system is the way in which each algorithms
difficulty is individually adjusted. Difficulty adjustment is managed by the “Dark Gravity
Wave v3” scheme (DGW), although originally developed for the Dash currency, DGW has
since been successfully implemented in other cryptocurrencies. DGW manages
network-hash spikes and network-hash drops more efficiently than the conventional
difficulty calculation, making it more difficult for malicious miners to quickly mine coins
without first processing transactions.

4. QUANTUM RESISTANCE

Current cryptocurrencies are generally not quantum-proof due to their use of ECDS
(which is vulnerable to Shor's Algorithm). Current transactions which use ECDS reveal the
users address in the process, exposing the crackable ECDS signature. Cracking such a
signature would allow unauthorized access to any and all funds associated with that
address, creating a potential threat every time a transaction is made.

The SHIELD protocol will introduce Lamport signatures, or similar schemes to enable
the quantum-proofing of transactions and addresses on the SHIELD network. Lamport
digital signatures are based on hash functions which are not vulnerable to Shor's
Algorithm, creating an additional layer of security for SHIELD users.
5. PRIVACY

SHIELD’s Project Perdu has recently been re-evaluated to ensure the correct path
forward is maintained. Early plans called for the implementation of the Wraith Protocol
devised by Verge Currency. However, due to Wraith Protocols relatively low specifications,
we have decided to instead use PrivateSend (developed by Dash). The decision to utilize
PrivateSend is advantageous as development plans to implement masternodes will be
more easily aligned. This change in direction will optionally improve the transaction speed
via InstantSend.

Although PrivateSend is an improvement, implementing the PrivateSend feature alone
will not make transactions entirely private, to address this, Zerocoin’ or
zk-SNARKs/zk-STARKs implementation is under consideration. Further details regarding
this aspect of SHIELD will be announced in Q2 2018.

To ensure location privacy is achieved in addition to the blockchain transaction privacy,
SHIELD will use Tor/I2P wallets/nodes that obfuscate the end-user’s IP address and
location.

6. FUNDING

SHIELD’s self-funding mechanism may involve using a percentage of the masternode
and mining block rewards. If this path is chosen, the percentage will be very small, as we
only need to keep the team afloat, and the remaining funding will be used for marketing.
We will also have some external sources of support which will be made by creating and
joining platforms that help both developers and users. For example, SHIELD has received
many donations from our supportive community which has enabled the development
progress to date, furthermore, SHIELD is currently receiving support from various mining
pools.

This community support will help progress the SHIELD project forward indefinitely
throughout the roadmap. SHIELD did not have an ICO or a premine, unlike many of our
competitors who have chosen this path; at SHIELD, we believe a strong, active community
will allow SHIELD to grow and expand more organically and adaptively.
7. APPLICATION SECURITY

Security is, and always has been, a core fundamental of the SHIELD currency. We
always strive to improve the security functionality of SHIELD, demonstrated in the
aforementioned quantum proofing protocols.

Throughout the development of the SHIELD currency, we have identified multiple
security flaws, predominantly in user interfaces, in many applications that interact with the
blockchain. For this reason, we aim to have all of our original products tested on multiple
levels. Using the open-source community, gathering pen testers to test applications
individually, and having all members of the development team check the code, ideally
acknowledging each commit before being pushed (not just for official updates). From our
experience using the SHIELD Discord bot, we have observed that - with a secure backend
- the link to the frontend is one of the most important aspects of a secure application.

8. INTEGRATION

The integration of a new technology with existing or purpose built platforms can be
integral in determining SHIELD’s ultimate usability and applicability. We will be using many
popular, free platforms, such as Discord, Twitter, Facebook and more, in order to improve
the SHIELD user experience. Integration on these platforms will be achieved through the
development of plugins and ‘bots’, providing users with the ability to send SHIELD to
friends, followers or influencers without the need to request a wallet address. Deeper
integration may include the development of platform specific wallets - negating the need
for users to have dedicated PC wallets in order to access their SHIELD currency.

Integration initiatives intended to achieve a more wide-spread level of public
consumption will also be pursued through a combination of networking, and reaching out
to organisations to develop additional use cases for SHIELD. This increased applicability
will be vital in ensuring a stable coin price is maintained in the future.
9. PoS BOO

Project Boo is SHIELD’s own PoS scheme, modeled after Ethereum’s PoS Casper.
With the introduction of a risk factor for malicious stakers, the Casper scheme improves
significantly on “POSv3”. The progressive nature of the protocol makes execution of
attacks exceptionally difficult, such as the 51% attack. A malicious attacker would need to
hold the majority of all minted coins, while running the risk of potentially losing them all
when launching such an attack.

The finality is mainly determined by stake and risk factors, which is why, theoretically, it
would be difficult to execute a attack successfully even with 51% of circulation (Figure 2).
A similar attack situation would be dire for a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin.

Project Boo will also solve the problem of transaction censoring. With PoW, a block
miner can “choose” not to mine a block containing certain addresses, thereby censoring
that address from the network. Since block creators are chosen at random, and validators
are global with this PoS scheme, censoring addresses from the network becomes
exceptionally difficult (with the added bonus that if you try to force the network, you will
likely lose your stake).

10. FUTURE STUDY

Throughout this white paper, we have discussed some possible features and
specifications that are not yet finalized. While some features such as “sharding”, and “RSK
Smart Contracts” are slated on our roadmap, but are not mentioned in this document. This
is due to the current state of the SHIELD currency project, which has gone through a
period of heavy development and careful consideration.

This white paper is not the representative of the finality of the SHIELD development
plan. The SHIELD team will release multiple white paper revisions aiming to improve
approachability and readability, while also providing updated details on aspects of the
project as the developers see necessary.

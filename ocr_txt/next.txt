COINBIT NEXT (NET)

Pre-existing Exchange Coins based on Trade Mining Profit Share Model have failed
to solve the problem of price depreciation following continuous coin issuance. NEXT
(NET) coin is differentiated, Mining Coin 2.0 that tackles such problem, We restrict
the initial issuance supply as 200,000,000 NET at the listing price of 1 KRW per coin,
and to prevent price depreciation, we will flexibly adjust daily NEXT issuance supply
accordingly to market situation.

At Exchange 2, will we not only gather at most 50% of the fees, whichis the most
ever, in Buy-Back Pool, but we also combine the fees of our profit to buy back NEXT.
Furthermore, we will continuously decrease the circulating supply through
proceeding buy back and burning of NEXT exceeding the daily issuance supply by
attracting distinguished foreign investors. This process will also continuously
stabilize, if not appreciate, the price of NEXT, thereby providing NEXT holders and

investors new opportunities they have never met before.

Business Vision of NEXT (NET)

Coinbit NEXT (NET) is our biggest project, as it presents anew business vision easily distinguishable from those of other
exchanges. We aim for globalization of our NEXT coin through listing on Coinmarketcap, as well as global exchanges, including
Binance. We also aim for leading real-life application through partnership with domestic and foreign enterprises. Furthermore,
through cooperation with other companies, we will always be adjusting the future direction of NEXT for the best possible
outcomes, and put our best efforts into NEXT.

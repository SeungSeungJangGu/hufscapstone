MassGrid

Decentralized High Performance Computing Network

Vision

With the rise of machine learning, big data, rendering services and search engines, high performance computing and parallel applica—

tions are becoming faster and more demanding.

The goal of MassGrid is to become the world’s largest distributed GPU high-performance cloud computing network.

MassGrid intends to transform the meaningless POW hash computing to general parallel computing that could be used for practical

purpose through our improved POW algorithm and redesigned blockchain network architecture.

Jump POW Algorithm Smart Task Distribution

GPU Computing Virtualization
GPU DOCKER Virtualization Tech-
nology virtualizes remote GPU
hardware resources to a client’s
devices. GPU DOCKER virtualiza—
tion enables users to freely sched—
ule hardware resources that are
physically distributed around the
world.

MassGrid’s P2P—based exchange
system is based on smart contracts
and runtimes, users can customize
the functions and pay rules for their
specifc requirement, making trading
more flexible and extendable.

Jump POW Algorithm is Mass—
Grid’s patented blockchain tech-
nology, it can resist quantum
attack and ASIC hardware take—
over, make the network safer,
fairer and guarantee all network
nodes are capable to run general
parallel algorithm.

What is Jump POW Algorithm

Most cryptocurrencies are based on a fixed hash algorithm, no matter how complicated the algorithm is and how much space complex—
ity it has. In the long time there is always the risk that mining could be replaced by ASIC hardware and finally centralized.

Jump hash constantly changes as blockchain’s data changes, Jump hash selects one hash algorithm from an algorithm pool which
contains dozens of algorithms according to certain rules, the combination of hash algorithm which will be used constantly changes at
each block.

MassGrid will eventually integrate 30 different Hash algorithms, to design an ASIC for MassGrid mining, all 30 hash algorithms must be
implemented in the hardware, only 1/30 of the chip resource will be used during computing each time, the rest will be idle.

Taken together, Jump Hash significantly increases the GPU’s energy efficiency relative to ASIC, as GPU power consumption and price
goes down, GPU-based Jump Hash POWs will outperform ASIC economically.

By implementing Jump Hash in our network, we can force all POW nodes to use the GPU for computing.

POW Hash Algorithm Pool

MassGrid’s algorithm pool picks 30 hash algorithms out of hundreds, combines the SHAS family with several dozens other top—se—
cure algorithms. All algorithms have been widely used and tested in many application before.

Jump Hash algorithm GPU and ASIC comparison

Only 1/30 of chip resource will be used in the ASIC
because of non— programmable hardware structure, the
remaining resource are idle

The programmable hardware structure of each comput-
ing unit on GPU dynamically switches algorithm to be
able to achieve 100% hardware resource efficiency

POW Computing Process

input blockData,lastBlockData ;
List hashIDs = GetHashIDByDataFactor(blockData,lastBlockData);
temp = blockData;
for( id in hashIDs){
temp = jumpHash[id](temp);
}

return temp;

In our blockchain, every time a new data block needs to be generate, the Jump hash algorithm first extracts the data feature of the
block or the previous block, and then selects one or several hash algorithm combinations according to the features of the data.
Then uses this algorithm or a combination of algorithms for hashing, returning the correct result if hit or otherwise continuing.

POW Verification Process

input hashResult ,blockData,lastBlockData;
List hashIDs = GetHashIDByDataFactor(blockData,lastBlockData);
temp = blockData;
for( id in hashIDs){
temp = jumpHash[id](temp);
}

return temp==hashResult;

When verifying the legitimacy of a data block, the Jump hash algorithm first extracts the data feature of the block or the previous
block, and then selects one or several hash algorithm combinations according to the features, uses the algorithm or combination of
algorithms for hashing, and compare the hash results to see it is correct.

GPU Computing Virtualization

Hash is currently the only POW algorithm with great features such as adjustable computational complexity, easy to verify, no data
dependence and low data transmission. However, compared to hash algorithms , general-purpose computing’s complexity , data
dependence , and data size varies with requirements, also it is not easy to verify, constraining general computing to ft POW can cause
problems with poor generality of the computational network.

By allowing users to access GPU resources in our computing network and allowing them to use virtualized GPUs to perform tasks and
be paid based on hardware performance and usage time, we have therefor changed general-purpose parallel POW computing to a
matter of virtualized GPU time—shared leasing.

The advantages of a distributed GPU hardware virtualization network are: a) Compatible with almost all GPU-based computing tasks.
b) Easy to calculate payment based on hardware performance and leasing time. c) Scaling flexibly on demand.

We hope to introduce a cross-platform and efficient GPU virtualization protocol that will agglomerate various types of GPU devices
into computing resources. In the future, we hope to optimize the x86 architecture so that any GPU devices following the virtualization

standard without Host could directly connect in the network.

The First Phase of MassGrid

The Second Phase of MassGrid

In the second phase, MassGrid will deploy multiple key nodes
in the network. POW miners will register their physical GPUs
to the key node. Key nodes will maintain a list of GPU
resources. Through remote virtualization, the POW miners’
physical GPUs will be mapped to users, user will use these
resources and pay according to hardware performance and
leasing time

MassGrid first implements a blockchain p2p network based
on the version 1.0 Jump hash algorithm that forces all nodes
accessing the network to use the GPU or CPU as computing
devices.

Among these nodes, some have GPU devices that efficiently
run Jump hash algorithms that perform POW computing and
provide cryptographic verification services for the entire
network.

POW Resource Trade Process

POW miners, computing users, normal users, and Key nodes are connected to each other through a p2p network , they will auto—
matically to do Jump Hash POW mining by default

POW miners will also register their physical GPU Key node, and the Key node will maintain a list of GPU resources

When users initiate a GPU lease request, the request is submitted to the Key node. The Key node freezes the user’s budget by
smart contract, establishes a virtualized connection for miner’s devices and users, and the connected GPU device stops POW
mining , and begins to run the user’s computing job

The Key node finally issues the frozen assets to the physical GPU host provider based on actual usage.

First, each Keynode maintains a large list of POW nodes that auto—
matically register itself with Key node when it accesses the network.

Users initiate GPU usage requests, submitting budgets and require-
ments to Keynode, waiting for Keynode evaluations;

cer Send request

Requests initiated include: GPU, CPU, memory performance require—
ments, estimated duration of use, etc.;

Key node verifies the legitimacy of the request, assesses the data
bandwides/computation requirements and esponds;

user in the POW network according to the needs and the location of

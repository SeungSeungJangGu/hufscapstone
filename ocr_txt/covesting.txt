Executive
summary

1.1 The Future of Cryptocurrency Investing

Over the past few years, cryptocurrencies proved
to be the fastest growing asset class and offered
phenomenal rewards for those who decided to
invest. Long term investors, as well as day traders,
benefit from the unique opportunities offered by
the most promising market we have ever seen.
However, investments into cryptocurrencies
require time, specific knowledge, analytical skills,
as well as professional tools to be successful. The
difficulty is the main reason why most people
simply miss tremendous opportunities offered
by a booming market.

This was the case until the COVESTING was
introduced.

changes and conceptual upgrades from the
moment when the first idea of a peer-2-peer
digital asset platform was disclosed by the
ounder, former Saxo Bank trader, Dmitrij Pruglo.

scalability opportunities have arisen which
brought COVESTING to a completely new level.

Intro

2.1 Market Analysis

With the enormous development of the
blockchain technology, new opportunities are
arising in the field of investing. Crypto markets
are borderless, open 24/7, and offer huge
potential for growth. A rapidly growing number
of initial coin offerings (ICO) has led to more than

2,000 new cryptocurrencies being created and
traded on daily basis, leading to high returns for
many investors.

In order to fully realize market potential, here is
the market capitalization of the top technology
based companies listed on the Nasdaq and
NYSE, compared to the market capitalization of
cryptocurrencies:

Microsoft - $645B USD

Bitcoin - $105B USD

Alibaba Group - $480B USD

The combined market capitalization of all
cryptocurrencies together is currently only
around $200B USD, which leaves lots of room to
expand. The overall cryptocurrency transaction

$200B

Ripple - $8B USD

volume has grown significantly in the past few
years for the speculative purposes of gaining
capital profit or by supporting projects that are
built on decentralized platforms.

G) COVESTING

There is no cryptocurrency in the world today
that is being used for the reason it was made for
more than it is being used by investors trading
it. Even Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple have
more transactions centred around trading and
investing than they do the actual use case of the
project or currency.

During the first half of 2017, transactions
surpassed the $325B USD mark, despite

“financial experts” once deeming blockchain and
cryptocurrency a “niche market”. This increase in
transaction volume is mainly driven by Bitcoin
and Ethereum. Bitcoin and Ethereum are both
inching closer to creating a scalable ecosystem,
interesting things are bound to happen in the
future. According to Juniper research, total
cryptocurrency transaction value may surpass
$1 Trillion USD by 2022.

Triple digit growth, amazing risk-reward ratios, and promising
global perspectives are only a few reasons why cryptocurrencies

shouldn't be overlooked by any investor willing to diversify their
portfolio and profit from opportunities offered by a booming
market.

2.2 Investor Opportunities

After someone decides they may be ready to
invest in digital assets, there is a sticking point:
cryptocurrency trading takes place on multiple
exchanges, all of which have different rules
and regulations, and often require a lengthy
verification process. Most potential Investors are
lost at this stage. Another problem is volatility,
which can negatively affect the overall trading
result of any inexperienced private investor.
The learning curve for investing in crypto assets
is extremely steep and experienced digital
asset traders are in the best position to fully
benefit from arising opportunities offered in the
blockchain revolution.

Investors may evaluate options of trusting
money to a private crypto trader or a fund, in
order to gain profit in newly established markets.
Such decisions can be very risky due to lack of
regulations and the high possibility of fraud.

2.3 Trader Problems

Problems that digital asset traders must deal
with are equally challenging. Launching a
personal fund requires technical knowledge,
programming skills, legal paperwork as well as
marketing costs and other expenses.

Only several digital asset funds have gained the
reputation necessary for backing, while private
crypto traders and newly established funds tend
o look for investors in online forums, social
networks or amongst their friends.

t takes many years of effort to build trust and
reputation in order to attract proper funding. As a
result, many successful traders and digital asset
raders are being overlooked and end up having
no access to investors capital, limiting their
opportunities and narrowing earnings potential.

Professional digital asset managers or funds
could be a smart solution for anyone, willing to
get exposure in the cryptocurrency market. But
how will retail investors find and choose the
most suitable cryptocurrency fund? How will
hey guarantee the security of their investment?
s the declared performance of a chosen asset
rader trustworthy?

2.4 Problems with Traditional Asset
Management

The Traditional asset management industry has
been plagued with multiple issues including
scams and corruptions since its inception.
Unethical and illegal manipulations by asset
managers with a large sum of money at their
©} COVESTING

disposal, Ponzi schemes, and sweeping
techniques are some of the common allegations
faced by the industry. The industry has
developed deep-rooted problems including
mutual mistrust, unethical practices, scamming,
and below-the-surface deals.

Trusting even professional asset managers
in traditional markets can sometimes lead to
problematic results. Stories of asset managers
making certain trades just to increase their

commission and drive up the fees to their
investors are just the beginning when it comes to
the level of dishonest activity when it comes to
investing other’s money. Every year, thousands
of licensed traders are found guilty of insider
trading, fraud, or scamming hard-working
investors.

P2P Digital
Asset Platform

The COVESTING Platform is the ultimate venue
where successful digital asset traders meet new
investors, in a transparent, safe and efficient
peer-2-peer investment environment.

nvestors from around the world can compare
he performance of hundreds of successful
cryptocurrency traders and mirror their trades
automatically to their account. While traders
benefit from success fees generated by profitable
rading — investors enjoy peace of mind knowing
hat their funds are following a model of an
industry professional in the comfort of their own
account.

By pairing the peer-2-peer business model
and the cryptocurrency investment industry,
COVESTING offers a fantastic opportunity to
utilize the wisdom of experienced traders in
order to achieve positive trading results securely.

3.1 Peer-2-Peer Definition

APeer-to-Peer, or P2P, Service itselfis a decentralized
platform whereby two individuals interact directly
with each other, without intermediation by a third-
party, or without the use of a business selling a
product or service. The buyer and the seller transact
directly with each other via the P2P service.

Some popular examples of P2P services are:

+ Open-source Software - anybody can view and/
or modify code for the software

+ BitTorrent —- a popular anonymous file-sharing
platform where uploaders and downloaders
meet to swap media and software files.

+ Air BnB - allows property owners to lease all or
part of their property to short-term renters.

+ Uber - a platform for car owners to offer
ransportation services to others

* eBay - a marketplace for private sellers of goods
0 find interested buyers.
» Etsy - enables producers of crafts and other
omemade goods to sell their items directly to
he public

3.2 For Investors

The COVESTING platform allows everyday
investors to search and compare the performance
of hundreds of proven cryptocurrency traders
and replicate their trading activity automatically.

After an investor decides to follow to the most
suitable strategy - the system will automatically
synchronize all trading activity from the chosen
investing Model into their segregated account at
COVESTING, providing the convenience of peer-
2-peer asset trading along with the safety of
funds.

Each investor can diversify their investments
by following up to 20 different Models (traders)
at the same time. Such diversification allows
investors to be uniquely positioned to record
gains across multiple crypto trading strategies
and protect themselves against massive losses
rN
C!) COVESTING

in any single cryptocurrency. More importantly,
investors are in total control - they can start or
finish the following whenever they want.

3.3 For Traders

The COVESTING platform helps investing talents
bring their trading results in front of the public
and compete with other traders in an unbiased
environment. With the COVESTING platform,
every trader can act as a digital asset trader and
grow their revenue by earning success fees. The
more successful they are, the more followers
they will acquire and the more money they'll
make from profitable trading.

Trading Models can be easily created by linking
an existing trading account at an external
cryptocurrency exchange through an API. From
this moment, all trading activity will be recorded
in the Model and the trader doesn’t need to
do anything else - just continue trading in the
comfort of his personal account.

Later, the trader will be able to decide whether
he wants to “list” his Model at the COVESTING
platform and make it visible for investors instantly
or keep it private for a while to build a solid track
record first.

The COVESTING Platform will provide such
opportunities to cryptocurrency traders:

+ Setup a trading Model and start performance

racking from day one

+ Describe the trading strategy, expected volatility

and returns

+ Enable investors to follow your trading Model

hrough your performance

» Earn success fees on all profits made by Model-

ollowing accounts

* Build a solid track record to acquire more

ollowers

+ Earn reputation and get reviews from previous

and existing investors

* Interact in a safe environment, make new

contacts, and grow professionally as a trader

. eep a blog, post news, trading ideas and market
analysis

For security reasons, Model Traders will never
know the amount of capital which is currently
following their strategy, only the number of

investors. All participants can choose to publish
their real names or remain anonymous by using
a screen-name alias.

3.4 Profit Distribution

Model Traders are rewarded with 18% success
fees from all profits generated by their followers,
the platform commission is 10%, while investors
receive the remaining 72% of income, which
is available for immediate withdrawal or
reinvesting.

Platform commissions of 10% will later be used
for systematic buyback and burn programs.

3.5 Synergy

Withthefeatures described above, the COVESTING
Platform creates a synergized marketplace that
brings investors, and professional cryptocurrency
traders together.

All parties benefit from the COVESTING platform:
cryptocurrency traders get visibility to new
audiences and sources of additional income,
while investors get a broad range of trading
strategies they may follow with the ability to
analyze historical performance in order to make
the right decision. Our goal is to create an easy-
to-use platform with a win-win solution for both
investors and professional traders

3.6 COVESTING in Four Simple Steps

1. Join. Register at COVESTING by filling a simple
form.
2. Find top traders. Compare the performance
of hundreds of successful Model Traders and find
the one or many matching your goals.

3. Follow. Once you found the strategy or
strategies you wish to follow, simply click
“Follow”. You will be asked to specify the
percentage of the funds you want to allocate to
the Model. The amounts for the replicated trades
will be calculated proportionally.

4. Monitor and control. You can now sit back
and watch professional traders do the job for
you. All trades from now on will be replicated
automatically. Most importantly - you are in
control. You can manage your portfolio by
following new strategies or stop copying a trader
at any time.

3.7 Platform specifications

At COVESTING we aim to develop an easy to use,
secure and efficient solution for both investors
and traders. COVESTING will deliver the mos
user-friendly, yet advanced peer-2-peer digita
asset platform. Below, we provide concep
specifications of the platform as well as a brie
explanation of the core features.

Registration
All users must be registered on the platform to carry ou
any activities. Registration is a standard process through
email, or through Facebook, Google, and Twitter.

COVESTING Account and Wallet

Allusers ofthe platform will have their own unique
wallet created automatically. After registration
with COVESTING platform, each user shall have
BTC, ETH and other addresses in their Wallet. By
depositing any of these coins, it is possible to
make internal exchanges from one currency to
another. However, only COV token can be used
for following a trading strategy.

Entry fee

There is a 2% entry fee that applies every
time user deposits funds to his account. This
commission accrues to the COV Asset Contract
increasing the value backing COV tokens.

Model Traders

A Model Trader is a user who created a trading
Model (strategy) in COVESTING platform. From
that moment, tracking of all trading activity starts
and the Model becomes available for following.

Investors

The investor is a user who is following a chosen
Model in order to benefit from the profitable
trading of a Model Trader. Each investor can
follow up to 20 different trading strategies.

Marketplace
The platform allows users to search, rank, filter
and compare all of the available trading Models.

Following to a Model

When an investor finds a suitable strategy and
starts following — all trading actions of a Model
will be replicated in their personal COVESTING

account with a proportional amount of funds,
predefined by the investor.

Segregated Accounts

To provide security and peace of mind to all
investors - we offer secure personal accounts for
each user within the COVESTING Platform. None
of the funds go directly to Model Trader, which
avoids trust and security issues.

Unfollowing the Model

At the point when an Investor unfollows a trading
odel - funds are immediately returned to their
wallet minus success fees and commission in
case of any profit they earned.

Each user can stop following to a trading Mode
whenever they like. The only occasion when
ollowing stops automatically is when a Model
Trader decides to terminate it. Funds would
hen be returned to all of the followers of the
erminated Model.

Profit Sharing
n case a trading Model resulted in profits for the
investor-follower, income distribution will look
ike this:

Success Fee - 18% of all profits will be transferred
0 the Model Trader’s wallet
Platform Commission - 10% of all profits and will
be automatically credited to COV Asset Contract
The remaining 72% shall be credited to the
investors wallet along with the initial investment.

Anonymous Mode
All users of COVESTING platform can choose to
publish theirreal names or remain anonymous by
using a screen-name alias. However, we believe
hat providing real names can be beneficial,
especially for successful Model Traders.

Trading Token

The COVESTING token is an ERC20 token and a
smart contract system built on the Ethereum
blockchain, and designed to be used by members
within the COVESTING platform. Following
this standard, COVESTING tokens are easily
transferable between users and platforms using
ERC20-compatible wallets and can be smoothly
integrated into exchanges.

7.1 COV Emission

Amaximum of 20.000.000 COVESTING tokens will
be generated, including 1.500.000 to conduct
a PrelCO, and 15.000.000 to conduct a full ICO.
Another 2.500.000 will be shared between the
founders of the COVESTING platform and locked
in a smart contract for 3 months, while the rest
will be generated for advisory, bounty and PR
pools.

Financials

Besides natural demand for COV, there are two
types of commission in the COVESTING p2p
platform used to back COV value and reward COV
token holders:

+ Entry commission 2% - charged every time an
investor deposits funds to their account, which
allows them start following to trading Models.

+ 10% platform commission - on all profits
realized by copy trading.

These fees will automatically accrue in the COV
Asset contract and will be used for systematic
buyback and burn programs in the future.

COVESTING intends to add additional recurring
revenue streams within the next 8-12 months,
including liquidity distribution to institutional
clients, commissions occurring from the
COVESTING Trading Terminal, Binary options
sale, and market making.

8.1 Asset Contract

The COV Asset Contract is an essential part of how
the value will be created for COV token holders.
With all commissions from the combined
infrastructure of COVESTING accrued in the Asset
Contract, it creates a sufficient pool of funds to

support the consistent growth in value of COV
tokens. As soon as the COVESTING platform starts
performing - we aim to distribute part of the
accrued commissions in the COV Asset Contract
towards Buy-back and Burn mechanism.

8.4 Rewarding Token Holders

We aim to allocate at least 50% of all platform
earnings to systematic Buyback and Burn programs.
This form of repayment program sets best practices
or the COV token economy, and simultaneously
serves in the best interest of COVESING token
holders. Technically speaking, we will systematically
buy COV tokens on exchanges and “Burn” them.
“Burning” means that purchased tokens will be
aken off the market, with the consequence that
he total supply of COV tokens will decrease. This
should effectively improve the value of COV over
ime. We will continuously monitor the regulatory
environment closely and possibly introduce
alternative methods of value distribution according
‘0 market guidelines.

9.1 Exchange Listing

COVESTING is actively working to list COV tokens
at the leading crypto exchanges. COV will become
raded on crypto exchanges shortly after the ICO.

9.2 Legal

n July, the Securities and Exchange Commission
issued a ruling that some of the “coins” offered
during recent ICOs are actually securities, and
hereby are subject to the agency’s regulations.
By offering dividends and profit-sharing such
companies failed the Howey Test, created by
he US Supreme Court for determining whether
certain transactions qualify as “investment
contracts.”

The Howey test consists of the following:

+ — Isitaninvestment of money or assets?

+ — Istheinvestment of money or assets in a common
enterprise?

+ Is there an expectation of profits from the
investment?

+ Does any profit come from the efforts of a
promoter or third party?

Unlike other tokens, COV COV is a utility token
and its purpose is to facilitate services (copy-
trading) on the COVESTING platform. COV is not
backed by real assets (such as real estate) and
doesn’t grant their holders any dividends.

As Tim Draper mentioned in his open letter: “Ifthe
purpose of a token is for societal transformation,
and all proceeds go to the support and
development of the token, it need not register.”

9.3 Road Map

Disclaimer

This documentis for information purposes only and is not an offer or a call to sell stocks
or securities.

COV tokens are not securities

User acknowledges, understands, and agrees that COV tokens are not securities and are
not registered with any government entity as a security, and shall not be considered as
such.

Absence of guarantees of income or profit

There is no guarantee that COV tokens will grow in value. There are no guarantees that
the price of COV coins will not decrease, including significantly, due to some unforeseen
events, or events over which the developers have no control, or because of force majeure
circumstances.

Risks associated with Ethereum

COV tokens will be issued on the Ethereum blockchain. Therefore, any failure or
malfunctioning of the Ethereum protocol may lead to the trading network of COV tokens
not working as expected.

Regulatory uncertainty

Blockchain technologies are subject to supervision and control by various regulatory
bodies around the world. COV tokens may fall under one or more requests or actions on
their part, including but not limited to restrictions imposed on the use or possession of
digital tokens such as COV coins, which may slow or limit the functionality or repurchase
of COV tokens in the future.

Risks of using new technologies

COV tokens are a new and relatively untested technology. In addition to the risks
mentioned in this document, there are certain additional risks that the team of the
COVESTING cannot foresee. These risks may manifest themselves in other forms of risk
than those specified herein.

LEGAL CONSIDERTIONS

The Company has approached the Token Sale
in a responsible and sensible manner. Given
the uncertain and largely unregulated status
of distributed ledger technologies, businesses
and activities as well as cryptocurrencies and
cryptocurrency-related businesses and activities,
the Company has spent a significant amoun

approach and where it proposes to operate now

eading law firm. The Gibraltar Financial Services
Commission has on 12th October 2017 published
a draft of the principled-based regulations which
relate to the use of distributed ledger technology
or storing and transmitting value belonging to
others, and which regulations come into effect
on lst January 2018. The Company will look
o comply with all Gibraltar regulations and
regulations of other jurisdictions thatitis required

regulation across the world, the Company cannot

RISK FACTORS

You should carefully consider and evaluate
each of the following risk factors and all other
information contained in these Terms before
deciding to participate in the Token Sale. To the
best of the Company’s knowledge and belief, all
risk factors which are material to you in making
an informed judgment to participate in the
Token Sale have been set out below. If any of
he following considerations, uncertainties or
material risks develops into actual events, the
business, financial position and/or results of
operations of the Company and the maintenance
and level of usage of the Tokens could be
materially and adversely affected. In such cases,
he trading price of Tokens (in the case where they
are listed on an exchange or market (regulated,
unregulated, primary, secondary or otherwise))
could decline due to any of these considerations,

uncertainties or material risks, and you may lose
all or part of your Tokens or the economic value
thereof.

RISKS RELATING TO PARTICIPATION IN THE
TOKEN SALE

There is no prior market for Tokens and the Token
Sale may not result in an active or liquid market
for the Tokens.

Prior to the Token Sale, there has been no public
market for the Tokens. Although the Company
may use reasonable endeavours to seek the
approval for availability of the Tokens for trading
on a cryptocurrency exchange or market, there
is no assurance that such approval will be
obtained. Furthermore, even if such approval is
granted by a cryptocurrency exchange, there is no
assurance that an active or liquid trading market
for the Tokens will develop, or if developed, will
be sustained after the Tokens have been made
available for trading on such market. There is
also no assurance that the market price of the
Tokens will not decline below the original or
issue purchase price (the “Purchase Price”).
The Purchase Price may not be indicative of the
market price of the Tokens after they have been
made available for trading on a market.

A Token is not a currency issued by any
central bank or national, supra-national or
quasi-national organisation, nor is it backed
by any hard assets or other credit nor is it a
commodity in the traditional sense of that
word. The Company is not responsible for, nor
does it pursue, the circulation and trading of
Tokens on any market. Trading of Tokens will
merely depend on the consensus on its value
between the relevant market participants. No
one is obliged to purchase any Token from any
holder of the Token, including the purchasers,
nor does anyone guarantee the liquidity or
market price of Tokens to any extent at any
ime. Furthermore, Tokens may not be resold to
purchasers who are citizens, nationals, residents
tax or otherwise) and/or green card holders of
Restricted Jurisdictions or to Restricted Persons
or to purchasers in any other jurisdiction where
he purchase of Tokens may be in violation of
applicable laws. Accordingly, the Company

SH

rN
C!) COVESTING

cannot ensure that there will be any demand or
market for Tokens, or that the Purchase Price is
indicative of the market price of Tokens after they
have been made available for trading on any
cryptocurrency exchange or market.

Future sales or issuance of the Tokens could
materially and adversely affect the market
price of Tokens.

Any future sale or issuance of the Tokens would
increase the supply of Tokens in the market and
this may result in a downward price pressure on
the Token. The sale or distribution of a significant
number of Tokens outside of the Token Sale
(including but not limited to the sales of Tokens
undertaken after the completion of the initial
crowdsale, issuance of Tokens to persons other
than purchasers for purposes of community
initiatives, business development, academic
research, education and market expansion and
issuance of Tokens as a reward to users of the
Company’s business platform or otherwise), or
the perception that such further sales or issuance
may occur, could adversely affect the trading
price of the Tokens.

Negative publicity may materially and
adversely affect the price of the Tokens.

Negative publicity involving the Company, the
Company’s business platform, the Tokens or
any of the key personnel of the Company and/
or regulation of distributed ledger technologies,
cryptocurrencies and/or crowdsales of tokens in
any jurisdiction, may materially and adversely
affect the market perception or market price of
the Tokens, whether or not it is justified.

The Company may not be able to pay any
anticipated rewards in the future.

There is no assurance that there will be sufficient
engagement in the Company’s business
platform such that you will receive any rewards
anticipated to be distributed to active users of
the Company's business platform. Further, even
in the event there is substantial engagement and
interactions among the users of the Company’s
business platform, there is no assurance you
personally will receive any part of the rewards.

This is because the ability of the Company to
pay any reward to you will depend on the future
results of operations and the future business and
financial condition of the Company, and there is
no assurance of the future results of operations
and the future business and financial condition
of the Company.

There is no assurance of any success of the
Company’s business platform or any future
Token functionality.

The value of, and demand for, the Tokens hinges
heavily on the performance of the Company’s
business platform and the continuous active
engagement of its users and success of its
contemplated business lines. There is no
assurance that the Company’s — business
platform will gain or continue to gain traction.
Furthermore, there is no assurance that any
uture Token functionality will be realised. While
he Company has made every effort to provide
a realistic estimate, there is also no assurance
hat the cryptocurrencies raised in the Token
Sale will be sufficient for the development o
he Company’s business platform and/or for the
proper development, structuring and licensing o
he anticipated future Token functionality. Forthe
oregoing or any other reason, the developmen
of the Company’s business platform and launch
of the anticipated Token functionality may not be
completed and there is no assurance that it wil
be launched at all. As such, distributed Tokens
may hold little worth or value and this would
impact its trading price.

The trading price of the Tokens may fluctuate
following the Token Sale.

The prices of cryptographic tokens in general
tend to be relatively volatile, and can fluctuate
significantly over short periods of time. The
demand for, and the corresponding market
price of, the Tokens may fluctuate significantly
and rapidly in response to, among others, the
following factors, some of which are beyond the
control of the Company:
1. new technical innovations;
2. analysts’ speculations, recommendations,
perceptions or estimates of the Token’s
market price or the Company's financial and

C!) COVESTING

business performance;

3. changes in market valuations and token
prices of entities with businesses similar
to that of the Company that may be listed
on the same cryptocurrency exchanges or
markets as the Tokens;

4. announcements by the Company of
significant events, for example partnerships,
sponsorships or new product developments;

5. fluctuations in market prices and

trading volume of cryptocurrencies on

cryptocurrency exchanges or markets;

6. additions or departures of key personnel of
t
S

he Company;
uccess or failure of the Company’s
management in implementing business and
growth strategies; and/or

8. changes in conditions affecting the
blockchain or financial technology industry,
the general economic conditions or market
sentiments, or other events or factors.

The funds raised in the Token Sale are
exposed to risks of theft.

The Company will make every effort to ensure
hat the funds received from the Token Sale
will be securely held in a wallet, with access
hereto by private keys held by reputable and
rusted parties. Further, the Company may
make every effort to ensure that the funds
received by it from Token Sale will be securely
held through the implementation of security
measures. Notwithstanding such — security
measures, there is no assurance that there will
be no theft of the cryptocurrencies as a result of
hacks, sophisticated cyber-attacks, distributed
denials of service or errors, vulnerabilities or
defects on the Token Sale website, in the smart
contract(s) on which the wallet and the Token
Sale relies, on the Ethereum blockchain or any
other blockchain, or otherwise. Such events
may include, for example, flaws in programming
or source code leading to exploitation or abuse
thereof. In such event, even if the Token Sale
is completed, the Company may not be able
to receive the cryptocurrencies raised and the
Company may not be able to use such funds
for the development of the Company’s business
platform and/or for launching any future Token
functionality. In such case, the launch of the

Company’s business platform and the structuring
and licensing of any future Token functionality
might be temporarily or permanently curtailed.
As such, distributed Tokens may hold little worth
or value and this would impact their trading
price.

RISKS RELATING TO THE COMPANY
The Company’s business platform.

Any events or circumstances which adversely
affect the Company or any of its successor
or affiliated operating entities may have a
corresponding adverse effect on the Company’s
business platform and/or on any future Token
functionality, including but not limited to the
development, structuring and launch of the
Company’s business platform and of any future
Token functionality. Such adverse effects would
correspondingly have an impact on the utility,
liquidity, and the trading price of the Tokens.

The Company may be materially and
adversely affected if it fails to effectively
manage its operations as its business
develops and evolves, which would have a
direct impact on its ability to maintain or
operate the Company’s business platform
and/or develop, structure and/or licence any
future Token functionality.

The financial technology and cryptocurrency
industries in which the Company competes
have grown rapidly over the past few years
and continue to evolve in response to new
echnological advances, changing business
models, shifting regulations and other factors. As
a result of this constantly changing environment,
he Company may face operational difficulties in
adjusting to the changes, and the sustainability 0
he Company will depend on its ability to manage
its operations, ensure that it hires qualified and
competent employees, and provides proper
raining for its personnel. As its business evolves,
he Company must also expand and adap
its operational infrastructure. The Company's
business will in part rely on its blockchain-based
software systems, cryptocurrency wallets or other
related token storage mechanisms, blockchain
echnology and smart contract technology. Al

36

rN
C!) COVESTING

of these systems, tools, and skillsets represent
complex, costly, and rapidly changing technical
infrastructure. In order to demonstrate continued
ability to effectively manage technical support
infrastructure for the Company’s business
platform, the Company will need to continue
o upgrade and improve its data systems and
other operational systems, procedures, and
controls. These upgrades and improvements
will require a dedication of resources and are
ikely to be complex and increasingly rely on
hosted computer services from third parties
hat the Company does not or will not control.
f the Company is unable to adapt its systems
and organisation in a timely, efficient, and cost-
effective manner to accommodate changing
circumstances, its business, financial condition
and/or results of operations may be adversely
affected. If the third parties whom the Company
relies on are subject to a security breach or
otherwise suffer disruptions that impact the
services the Company uses, the integrity and
availability of its internal information could
be compromised, which may consequently
cause the loss of confidential or proprietary
information and/or economic loss. The loss of
inancial, labour or other resources, and any
other adverse effect on the Company’s business,
inancial condition and/or operations, would
have a direct adverse effect on the Company’s
ability to maintain or operate the Company’s
business platform and/or to develop, structure
and/or license the anticipated future Token
unctionality. Any adverse effects affecting the
Company business or technology are likely to
also adversely impact the utility, liquidity, and
rading price of the Tokens.

The Company may experience system
failures, unplanned interruptions in_ its
network or services, hardware or software
defects, security breaches or other causes
that could adversely affect the Company’s
infrastructure network, and/or the
Company’s business platform.

The Company is not able to anticipate when
there would be occurrences of hacks, cyber-
attacks, distributed denials of service or errors,
vulnerabilities or defects in: the Company’s
business platform, in the smart contracts on

which the Company or the Company’s business
platform relies, or on the Ethereum or any
other blockchain. Such events may include, for
example, flaws in programming or source code
leading to exploitation or abuse thereof. The
Company may not be able to detect such hacks,
cyber-attacks, distributed denials of service errors
vulnerabilities or defects in a timely manner, and
may not have sufficient resources to efficiently
cope with multiple service incidents happening
simultaneously or in rapid succession.

The Company’s network or services, which would
include the Company’s business platform and, if
successfully structured, developed, licensed and
launched, the future Token functionality, could
be disrupted by numerous events, including
natural disasters, equipment breakdown,
network connectivity downtime, power losses,
or even intentional disruptions of its services,
such as disruptions caused by software viruses or
attacks by unauthorized users, some of which are
beyond the Company’s control. There can be no
assurance that cyber-attacks, such as distributed
denials of service, will not be attempted in the
uture or that the Company’s security measures
will be effective. The Company may be prone
0 attacks on its infrastructure intended to steal
information about its technology, financial
data or user information or take other actions
hat would be damaging to the Company and/
or holders of the Tokens. Any significant breach
of the Company’s security measures or other
disruptions resulting in a compromise of the
usability, stability, and security of the Company’s
business platform may adversely affect the utility,
liquidity and/or trading price of the Tokens.

The Company may in the future be
dependent in part on the location and data
centre facilities of third parties.

The Company’s future infrastructure network
may be established in whole or in part through
servers which it owns and/or houses at the
location facilities of third parties, and/or servers
that it rents at data centre facilities of third
parties. If the Company is unable to renew its
data facility leases on commercially reasonable
terms or at all, the Company may be required to
transfer its servers to a new data centre facility,
¢

rN
C!) COVESTING

and may incur significant costs and possible
service interruption in connection with the
relocation. These facilities are also vulnerable
to damage or interruption from, among others,
natural disasters, arson, terrorist attacks, power
losses, and telecommunication failures.

Additionally, the third-party providers of such
facilities may suffer a breach of security as a
result of third-party action, employee error,
malfeasance or otherwise, and a third party
may obtain unauthorised access to the data in
such servers. The Company and the providers of
such facilities may be unable to anticipate these
techniques or to implement adequate preventive
measures.

General global market and _ economic
conditions may have an adverse impact
on the Company’s operating performance,
results of operations and/or cash flows.

The Company could continue to be affected by
general global economic and market conditions.
Challenging economic conditions worldwide
have from time to time, contributed, and may
continue to contribute, to slowdowns in the
information technology industry at large.
Weakness in the economy could have a negative
effect on the Company’s business, operations
and financial condition, including decreases in
revenue and operating cash flows, and inability
to attract future equity and/or debt financing on
commercially reasonable terms. Additionally,
in a down-cycle economic environment, the
Company may experience the negative effects ofa
slowdown in trading and usage of the Company’s
business platform and may delay or cancel the
development, structuring, licensing and/or
launch of the anticipated Token functionality.

Suppliers on which the Company relies for
servers, bandwidth, location and other services
could also be negatively impacted by economic
conditions that, in turn, could have a negative
impact on the Company’s operations or
expenses. There can be no assurance, therefore,
that current economic conditions or worsening
economic conditions or a prolonged or recurring
recession will not have a significant, adverse
impact on the Company’s business, financial

condition and results of operations, and hence,
the Company’s business platform and/or the
ability to develop, structure, license and/or
launch any future Token functionality. Any such
circumstances would then correspondingly
negatively impact the utility, liquidity, and/or
trading price of the Tokens.

The Company or the Tokens may be affected
by newly implemented regulations.

Distributed ledger technologies, businesses
and activities as well as cryptocurrencies
and cryptocurrency-related businesses and
activities are generally unregulated worldwide,
but numerous regulatory authorities across
jurisdictions have been outspoken abou
considering the implementation of regulatory
regimes which govern distributed ledger
echnologies, businesses and activities as wel
as cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency-related
businesses and activities. The Company or the
Tokens may be affected by newly implemented
regulations relating to distributed ledger
echnologies, businesses and activities as wel
as cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency-related
businesses and activities, including having to
ake measures to comply with such regulations,
or having to deal with queries, notices, requests
or enforcement actions by regulatory authorities,
which may come at a substantial cost and
may also require substantial modifications to
he Company’s business platform and/or the
anticipated Token functionality. This may impac
he appeal or practicality or functionality o
he Company’s business platform and/or the
anticipated Token functionality for users and
result in decreased usage of and demand for the
Company’s business platform and the Tokens.
Further, should the costs (financial or otherwise
of complying with such newly implemented
regulations exceed a _ certain threshold,
maintaining the Company’s business platform
and/or developing, structuring, licensing and/
or launching the future Token functionality
may no longer be commercially viable, and
the Company may opt to discontinue the
Company’s business platform, the anticipated
future Token functionality, and/or the Tokens.
Further, it is difficult to predict how or whether
governments or regulatory authorities may

COVESTING

implement any changes to laws and regulations
affecting distributed ledger technology and
its applications, including the Company’s
business platform, the anticipated future Token
functionality, and/or the Tokens.

The Company may also have to cease operations
in a jurisdiction that makes it illegal to operate
in such jurisdiction, or make it commercially
unviable or undesirable to obtain the necessary
regulatory approval(s) to operate in such
jurisdiction. In scenarios such as the foregoing,
the utility, liquidity, and/or trading price of
Tokens will be adversely affected and/or Tokens
may cease to be traded.

There may be unanticipated risks arising
from the Tokens.

Cryptographic tokens such as the Tokens are
a relatively new and dynamic technology. In
addition to the risks included in the above
discussion of risk factors, there are other risks
associated with your purchase, holding, and use
of the Tokens, including those that the Company
cannot anticipate. Such risks may further appear
as unanticipated variations or combinations of
the risks discussed above.

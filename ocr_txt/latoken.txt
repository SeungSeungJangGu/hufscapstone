MISSION

LATOKEN facilitates the broad use of cryptocurrencies in the real economy and allows
cryptoholders to diversify their portfolio by getting access to tokens linked to the price of
real assets.

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

LATOKEN is a blockchain platform for creating and trading asset tokens. LATOKEN
enables asset owners to unlock the value of assets by creating and selling their asset
tokens. As a result, cryptocurrencies will be widely used in the real economy.

The platform enchances liquidity and transparency of assets, as well as reduces
transaction costs. It provides cryptoholders with transparent price discovery and
diversification across multiple asset classes as it allows the creation or listing of third-
party asset tokens compliant with LATOKEN disclosure and legal structure rules. The
LATOKEN platform is already operational: asset tokens can be created, listed for sale
and traded.

LATOKEN is based on a profitable home equity marketplace and a back office for
hedge funds founded by Valentin Preobrazhenskiy, who invested $1 million in these
businesses.

The LATOKEN team has a strong track record in hedge fund management, development
of marketplaces, trading terminals and has worked at companies such as Avega Capital,
cKinsey, BCG, Emst & Young.

We adhere to the principles of sustainable growth, integrity and good governance, which
is why we sell a small share of tokens in order to have a strong incentive to develop the
product and grow capitalization of LATOKEN (this is not the case when most tokens are
sold, and full cash is received in advance without the product in place).

LA is the main currency for trading asset tokens as it is used for market making and
iquidity enhancement by the LATOKEN liquidity fund. Thus, the demand for LA
correlates with trading volume on the LATOKEN platform.

Total value of asset cryptocurrencies could reach $4 trillion by 2025 with global trading
volume exceeding $47 trillion. The value of asset cryptocurrencies traded on the
LATOKEN platform could reach $1.2 trillion by 2025 with trading volume exceeding
$14 trillion.

2. VALUE PROPOSITION

2.1. Exposure to the price of real assets
for cryptoholders

At LATOKEN, cryptoholders can benefit from being exposed to the price of various real
assets: equity, debt, gold, real estate, commodities, artwork. The value of these assets
totals $517 trillion and cryptoholders can purchase tokens linked to their price on the
LATOKEN platform with low transaction costs and maximum transparency and security.

In addition to trading tokens linked to the price of liquid assets (e.g. shares, commodities,
bonds), LATOKEN offers a unique opportunity for cryptoholders to gain exposure to the
value of illiquid assets accessible only to large investors (Such as real estate and artwork)
and thus increase their ROI and diversify their portfolio.

information on traded tokens is available and visible to every user registered on the
LATOKEN platform.

2.2. Unlocking asset value by disruptive
reduction of transaction costs

LATOKEN allows asset owners to unlock the value of their assets and gain instant
liquidity by creating asset tokens and selling them to cryptoholders with minimal
transaction costs.

Equity

Listing equity on a stock exchange is a very costly process. Underwriter and bookrunner
syndicate fees range from 2% to over 6%' of gross proceeds from the offering,
application and filing fees average around $25k? . Moreover, each year the equity issuer
has to pay listing fees exceeding $100k on the leading stock exchanges.

Public companies also have to spend over $100k° per annum as remuneration to an
independent executive director and audit committee. Listing preparation takes around 6
months, assuming the company is IPO-ready. Broker commission costs of trading equity
average 1% for retail investors.

LATOKEN allows equity owners to create asset tokens linked to equity prices with
negligible cost and preparations taking up to one week.

Debt

Issuing debt on a leading stock exchange incurs initial listing fees of ~$20,000 and an
annual fee of ~$20,000+. Underwriting fees generally amount to over 1% of total gross
proceeds from debt issuance. Preparation takes around 3 months and typically requires
a lengthy legal proceeding, including NDA signing, disclosure letters, transfer
documentation, and the final stage of SPA. Broker commission costs of trading debt
average 1% for retail investors. Minimal debt issue amounts reach $5 million at leading
stock exchanges.

The issue of selling debt is especially topical for banks constantly looking for ways to
increase their liquidity and unlock the value of their portfolios.

Artwork

The highly inefficient artwork market associated with high transaction costs is another
space for development of the LATOKEN platform.

As per the example below seller fees associated with an artwork sale are 20-25% of the
sale price (hammer price) while a buyer’s premium is charged up to 25% (according to
Sotheby’s commission structure). Thus, buyers overpay a significant amount over the
hammer price, while sellers receive far less than the auction price.

LATOKEN offers cryptoholders direct exposure to the value of artwork eliminating the
middlemen (e.g., dealers and auction houses), dramatically reducing transaction costs
and providing fair market valuation and liquidity.

2.3. Elimination of information
asymmetry and fraud

The issue of information asymmetry between asset owners and buyers is leading to a
significant erosion in the market itself; low-quality assets become more profitable to sell
than high-quality assets.

Fraud is another issue troubling the financial sector. There have been numerous legal
proceedings arising from fraudulent mortgage-backed securities (MBS) after the 2008
crisis. In 2016, the largest private loan marketplace (Lending Club) lost 80% of its
capitalization after investors recognized they could not trust its loan records because of
the detected fraudulent records in its loan portfolio database. Leading private UK P2P
website Funding Knight filed for bankruptcy in the same year after it ran out of cash due
to its non-transparent activities.

LATOKEN.COM 8

Even with all the financial fortifications in place and armies of back-office employees
monitoring the movement of money, fraud is still a significant issue in the financial sector
due to separate isolated databases and hard copy data prevailing across the banking
sector.

Blockchain technology makes trustworthy data available to both parties prior to the
transaction and thus provides greater certainty of its worthiness, thereby reducing risks
associated with asymmetric information and fraud.

There are many blockchain projects offering tokenization of different asset classes from
real estate to equity. However, most of them are in the concept stage. Only LATOKEN
has a working business with the marketplace and the back office in place’.

Few projects are already in the working business stage. Bitbond is a peer-to-peer lending
platform. Despite its blockchain functionality, it does not provide a secondary market for
debt.

Digix is about to launch tokens DGX backed by 1 gram of gold each. After ICO in 2016,
capitalization of the company’s token DGD increased to more than $160 million.
However, it is impossible to get gold-backed DGX so far as the marketplace is not in
operation yet.

Some projects created an MVP, allowing trading tokens of a single asset. Proof
company) provides a marketplace for trading tokens of real estate properties; currently
it allows trading of four properties in the test mode.

BlockOptions adds blockchain functionality to binary options market and already offers
binary options on BTC price movements as an MVP. ZrCoin is a cryptocurrency backed
by shares of zirconium mining company.

any similar projects target real estate, artwork market and some other markets,
however they have not completed an MVP so far.

3.3. Wide diversification options across
major asset classes

Such projects as Brickblock and Digix work on markets that are already relatively liquid
(ETFs, REFs, commodities). These projects involve only part of the problem solved by
LATOKEN: seamless transactions and better security for funds, thanks to blockchain
functionality.

Some projects ease transactions in one of the illiquid asset classes, such as real estate
and peer-to-peer debt, by breaking them into chunks. Very few (e.g. Proof) of these
projects enable trading on the secondary market. No competitor allows trading across
different asset classes.

At the same time, LATOKEN allows cryptoholders to diversify across all major asset
classes ensuring single compliance and disclosure standards. Other asset tokens may
also be traded on the LATOKEN platform if they meet compliance standards.

4, HOW IT WORKS

4.1. Trading of tokens linked to liquid
asset price

Publicly traded equity, debt and commodities trade

On the LATOKEN platform, cryptoholders can buy tokens linked to the price of publicly
traded assets (shares, bonds and commodities). The process is as follows:

1) | LATOKEN issues tokens linked to the price of publicly traded assets (e.g. an
Apple share

2) — Cryptoholders buy asset tokens at an auction on the LATOKEN platform using
cryptocurrency

3) Onapre-determined settlement date, LATOKEN buys back asset tokens from
cryptoholders at the current market price of the underlying asset (e.g. current
market price of an Apple share on the NASDAQ)

This is very similar to purchasing a forward contract on a stock exchange. The advantage
is that, due to much lower transaction costs on the LATOKEN platform, even small retail
cryptoholders can benefit from the upside potential of stocks, bonds and commodities
without converting cryptocurrency to fiat.

LATOKEN.COM 12
©

4.2. Trading of tokens linked to illiquid
asset price

Another advantage of LATOKEN is that it allows asset owners and cryptoholders to easily
create and trade tokens linked to the price of previously illiquid assets, such as real estate
and artwork. The general process of the asset token creation and sale on the LATOKEN
platform consists of 4 steps:

1) | Asset owner signs an agreement with a LATOKEN-certified Trustee transferring
ownership rights to the Trustee

2) he Trustee issues tokens linked to the price of the asset and sells them to
cryptoholders on the LATOKEN platform

3) — Cryptoholders may sell asset tokens on a secondary market

4) The asset owner buys back asset tokens on the settlement date or the Trustee
sells the asset at a fiat auction

However, there are specific details depending on asset class. Cases of real estate and
artwork tokenization are provided below to illustrate these details.

Real estate tokenization

Step 1. Qualification check

Filling out a short questionnaire, an asset owner provides basic information about the
real estate property, the share they want to tokenize (maximum share is 80%), settlement
date, and their household finances. On the basis of this information, LATOKEN
preapproves or rejects the application for tokenization.

In preapproved cases, the asset owner receives an indicative non-binding estimate of his
property’s value. Then, he is asked to provide a full package of documentation and
complete an application.

Step 2. Property appraisal and insurance

An independent vendor (selected by the asset owner from a list of LATOKEN-certified
appraisal firms) conducts an on-site appraisal of the property. The appraisal report is
shared with the homeowner upon completion. The property must be insured by the asset
owner prior to tokenization.

Step 3. Custodial agreement

A LATOKEN-certified Trustee receives documents preserving the right to exercise the
sale of the property in case it is not bought out (in the US: promissory note, deed of trust
and memorandum of option from a property owner)

_—_ Qovseaatsgeonet |
OO CUSTODIAN

Step 4. Asset tokenization

After the custodial agreement is made, the homeowner can create tokens linked to the
value of the tokenized part of their property.

Steps 5-6. Asset token sale and transfer of funds

Asset tokens are sold at an auction on the LATOKEN platform to cryptoholders.
Proceeds are transferred to the asset owner.

Steps 7. Asset token buy back
A homeowner can buy back asset tokens on a pre-determined settlement date or before.

The buyback price will be determined based on the property’s second appraisal,
conducted prior to the settlement date. The buyback price is determined in USD value
and then converted to LA at the current exchange rate.

Thus, the buyback price may be higher or lower than the initial sale price. If the property
depreciates, the cost to buy back the asset token will be proportionally less than the
initially originated amount.

If ahomeowner decides not to buy back asset tokens, the Trustee will sell the real estate
via fiat currency auction. Auction proceeds will be distributed among asset token holders
in crypto or fiat currency.

The homeowner does not incur penalties for early redemption. Once asset tokens are
bought back, a deed of reconveyance is issued to the homeowner and the asset tokens
are eliminated.

LATOKEN.COM 14
©

Artwork tokenization
Step 1. Application for sale

The owner of the artwork fills in a form on the LATOKEN platform for artwork tokenization,
providing basic asset information, results of previous appraisals (if available), share of
asset to be tokenized, and ownership rights.

Step 2. Asset appraisal

Prior to artwork tokenization, it is subject to tests for authenticity, appraisal, and
insurance by LATOKEN-certified vendors.

Step 3. Custodial agreement

A LATOKEN-certified Trustee and applicant sign a binding agreement for mandatory
future open fiat auction sale of the asset by the settlement date.

Step 4. Asset tokenization

When all legal issues are settled, tokens linked to the value of the artwork are issued on
the LATOKEN platform and become available for cryptoholders. All raised funds are
transferred to the asset owner (excluding LATOKEN’s commission fees).

Step 5. Asset token buy back

By the settlement date, the applicant must sell his artwork at a fiat auction and distribute
the proceeds among the asset token holders in LATOKEN platform at the current
exchange rate. If he fails to do this, the asset will be sold at a fiat auction by the Trustee.

4.3. Service vendors

The asset tokenization process at LATOKEN platform will be facilitated by independent
service vendors: appraisal firms, insurance companies, trustees, law firms. To be
registered on the LATOKEN platform, service providers will have to meet strict admission
criteria ensuring their reliability and quality of service. Asset owners may select a service
vendor of their choosing or from the list of registered providers.

5. LATOKEN PLATFORM

The LATOKEN platform is the heart of the financial blockchain-powered ecosystem. Key
elements of the LATOKEN platform are LATOKEN wallet, Asset token constructor,
LATOKEN marketplace, trading terminal, and ICO listing.

6. KEY ASSET MARKETS
6.1. Equity market

World market cap of listed domestic companies as of 2016 is~$65 tn® with global annual
stock turnover of ~$86 tn’. Although listed companies are among the most liquid asset
classes, liquidity varies greatly across stock markets and individual stocks. Stock market
turnover varies across countries from 0.2% in Luxemburg to 480% in China.

Listed stocks might be inaccessible for investors abroad due to the high cost of listing

means that companies that make up major part of the economy are currently cut off from
the wide equity investor base.

6.2. Debt market

Global debt market value grew by $7.6 trillion to more than $215 trillion in 201619 with a
total trading value of $52 trillion annually’?. Transaction costs of trading debt are currently
estimated at $150 billion.

6.3. Real estate market

Until now, to get exposure to real estate one had to buy the whole property or buy shares
of real estate funds (REFs). High transaction costs and a very limited choice of REF
investment opportunities led to a reality where turnover is significantly lower, despite the
fact that real estate has nearly the same total asset value as the stock market.

The size of the global real estate market has reached $217 trillion’? and residential
property makes up about 75% of the total value.

While annual real estate trading volume totals around $16 trillion with estimated trade
transaction costs of ~$100 billion’S, we see a growing trend and a chance to seize the
opportunity offered by tokenization to unlock the value of real estate assets.

6.4. Commodities market

Commodities are typically traded on futures and options markets, while spot market
turnover is significantly lower. Four major segments of physical commodities account for
35% of total futures trading volume on exchanges: agriculture, energy, industrial metals
and precious metals. Trading of futures has been growing very rapidly over the past 10
years. From 2007 to 2016, the number of contracts traded in the agricultural, energy and
industrial metals categories rose from 1.16 billion to 5.77 billion'*, with a total nominal
value of more than $100 trillion.

Liquidity and trading volumes vary greatly across traded commodities. The most traded
include: crude oil, natural gas, heating oil, RBOB gasoline, gold, sugar, corn, wheat,
soybeans, copper, soybean oil, silver, cotton, cocoa. Purely financial transactions in the
most popular commodities are outnumbering physical trades by a factor of more than
200. For example, average daily traded volume in crude oil futures exceeded $100 billion
with 2.2 billion barrels of oil traded daily in Q2 20171, while daily production volume was

8.9 million barrels. Transaction fees for liquid contracts vary from below 0.01% to about
0.1% of contract nominal value.

Less than 100 types of commodities contracts are traded on exchanges and may enjoy
high liquidity. Many others are not, including high volume commodities, such as steel of
different grades, titanium, rare earth, different alloys, some precious metals, gems,
chemicals, several types of coal. Investors willing to be exposed to these commodities
should either sign OTC contracts, buy commodities physically and store them or buy
shares of publicly traded mining companies. Some of these commodities are particularly
interesting for investors, e.g. electronics producers who want to hedge from rising rare
earth prices or speculators who want to bet on gem appreciation. LATOKEN provides a
much more convenient access to these markets via tokenization.

6.5. Artwork market

Global artwork holdings amount to around $3 trillion'®, while worldwide auction and
private sales in 2016 raised more than $50 billion'’. Given high auction house
commissions — which average around 20-25% of the sale price — we see the potential to
eliminate the middleman, thereby reducing commission costs.

The pledge services market of artwork is currently underdeveloped. Overall value of
current loans secured by artwork amounted to more than $8 billion. About 8% of global
collectors used the strategy of securitization of artwork, and only 22% of banks provide
such services. Reportedly, more than 30% of banks have plans to get art work
securitization under way'8. Given the demon stable demand of global collectors and low
penetration, we expect LATOKEN to be a driver of market growth and accelerated
development of artwork tokenization services.

The number of cryptocurrency wallets has doubled every year since 2013. Demand for
crypto will be driven by the emergence of less volatile asset cryptocurrencies. If it
continues to double, the adoption rate could reach 75% by 2025. However, considering
the obstacles imposed by some governments, we should expect a slowdown with an
average annual growth rate of 45%. In that case, the adoption rate will be above 5% by

capitalization of alternative cryptocoins exceeded that of Bitcoin for the first time in May
2017, as innovations increase their utility and make them more attractive for crypto

At the same time, incumbent cryptocurrencies will attract users with their well-developed

that cryptocurrencies offering the highest utility to their users will hold the dominant
market positions.

Capitalization of asset cryptocurrencies could surpass $4
trillion

According to the theory of money, the main functions of money include medium of
exchange, store of value and a unit of account.

Most of the cryptocurrencies can be used as a medium of exchange that is superior to
fiat due to disintermediation and trustless exchange, better security and lower transaction
costs. Traditional cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin, may
become a store of value only in case of strict commitment to low supply growth credibly
backed by the network’s distributed protocol and wide adoption, ensuring high liquidity.
At the same time, these traditional cryptocurrencies are inherently too volatile to be used
as a unit of account outside of the ecosystem where cryptocurrencies dominate, such
as ICO services.

The volatility index for traditional cryptocurrencies exceeds that for real assets, Such as
gold and fiat currencies, by a factor of 5 to 10. For example, current 60-day BTC volatility
is 5.88%, while 60-day gold volatility is just 0.53%.

Asset cryptocurrencies, which have a value linked to real-world assets, such as
equities, commodities or fiat money, have an advantage over traditional cryptocurrencies.
They have the benefits of traditional crypto, such as low transaction costs, security,
trustless exchange and smart contracts functionality. At the same time, they are a good
store of value by design, since their volatility is lower. A diversified portfolio of asset
cryptocurrencies is a better option from the risk management point of view than investing
in one or several traditional cryptocurrencies. Asset crypto also has an advantage over
real world assets, since there are no costs associated with conversion from crypto to fiat.

Market capitalization of asset cryptocurrencies is around $10 bn, as opposed to $160
bn market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies?4. These are numbers that institutional
investors can obviously no longer ignore. A few highlights in the media, such as Business
Insider, Bloomberg and Fortune, confirm that the interest in asset cryptocurrencies is
clearly rising.

Notable examples of asset crypto are cryptocoins linked to fiat

Disruption of trading transaction costs on the blockchain

Transaction costs on the blockchain are significantly lower than those imposed by
centralized institutions in the traditional economy. For example, in the United States, the
acquiring fee averages approximately 2% of transaction value. Average transaction costs
of Ethereum were 0.00257 % for a typical transaction value of $13,566 in July 201725.

Meanwhile, we should keep in mind that transaction volume grows fast, and transaction
costs inflate as they compete for limited computational power. Since cryptocurrency
transaction costs are fundamentally driven by blockchain technology design and
computational power, we believe that they will eventually go down as technology
improves and computational power increases. According to Moore’s law, the number of
transistors per square inch on integrated circuits doubles every 2 years. Although it has
slowed in recent years, computational power is still increasing quickly.

According to FT, Brian Krzanich, CEO of Intel, estimated that over the last two technology
transitions, cadence was closer to two and a half years than two?. This implies at least
a 20% cost decline per year. Hashing algorithm improvements should also reduce
computational complexity.

transaction volume significantly exceeds their capitalization. Turnover is 9.3 for Bitcoin

Asset owners will strive for tokenization to get a 10-40%
liquidity premium

Owners of illiquid assets cannot withhold significant amounts of assets in a short period
of time when they need to raise capital. According to many studies®', typical illiquidity
costs are in the range of 10-40% of the asset value. That is, restricted securities,
securities issued by a company that can be sold through private placements to investors,
but cannot be resold in the open market for a certain period, trade at significant discounts

of 7-35% according to research. Thus, we should expect that tokenization of illiquid
assets will increase their valuation by at least 10%.

High illiquidity costs make asset tokenization a very attractive opportunity for asset
owners as long as the asset owner’s total tokenization costs are significantly lower than
10%. As soon as tokenization technology goes online, and demand reaches scale,
tokenization becomes too attractive for asset owners to ignore.

Asset cryptocurrencies are a safe haven for crypto

As a large number of asset cryptocurrencies go online

COUNTER-CYCLICAL TO crypto portfolios to minimize risks. Currently, when the
TRADITIONAL confidence of crypto. owners _ in _ traditional
CRYPTOCURRENCIES cryptocurrencies drops, they reallocate funds from their

portfolios into fiat, traditional financial and real assets. In
contrast to traditional assets, frictions of buying asset cryptocurrencies are significantly
ower for crypto owners. At the same time, their value is linked to that of real assets. This
makes asset cryptocurrencies a much more convenient alternative to traditional assets
or crypto holders, especially if they don’t want to escape the blockchain ecosystem.
Thus, asset cryptocurrencies are countercyclical to traditional cryptocurrencies. This
makes them an indispensable part of a good crypto portfolio.

Furthermore, recent moves in regulations imposed by some governments against
traditional cryptocurrencies and coins issued for fundraising purposes? do not make
hem more stable and secure. This makes asset cryptocurrencies a safe alternative to
raditional cryptocurrencies, since it is easier to disprove illegal fundraising and allegations
of using Ponzi schemes for asset cryptocurrencies.

Platform tokens

A token that will be used as a means of exchange on crypto platforms should have the
lowest transaction costs and highest liquidity. Since it will power trades, we expect it to
play the role of cash in crypto holders’ portfolios and account for a significant share of
these portfolios. In 2016, cash accounted for 4.5%-5.5% of assets managed by a group
of the largest primarily long-only investors according to the Global FMS Cash Indicator
calculated by Bank of America Merrill Lynch®’. Since a platform token grows as trading
volume grows, some token holders may be passively holding it. Thus, we can expect
that at least 10% of traded asset value will be stored in platform tokens.

A token used in platform transactions is more stable and less susceptible to bubbles and
speculators’ attacks compared to other traditional cryptocurrencies, due to a high

transaction volume running in the opposite direction to different asset tokens. Also, like
asset tokens, this token is countercyclical to other cryptocurrencies. When investors
want to get away from traditional cryptocurrencies, its price increases, as it is required
for transactions with asset tokens. Its value is driven by platform transaction volume. As
long as transaction volume on the crypto platform increases, demand for this token
increases.

8. TECHNOLOGY
8.1. Overview

Most popular cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Litecoin, were pioneers of the
blockchain technology.

They were robust and innovative, but had very limited functionality as they were not
scaled to handle thousands of transactions per second and transaction fees were high
on public networks. Then, the new word in the blockchain industry was Ethereum, which
introduced the power of smart contracts to the world. This technology created new
demand on the market for “intelligent blockchains” with the ability to run decentralized
applications. However, major problems with these protocols, including slow transaction
speed (e.g.: 1 hour for Bitcoin) and impossibility of reacting (by smart contracts) to

external (non-blockchain) events, makes them almost unusable for real-world challenges.

The next-gen Graphene-based blockchains based on DPOS mechanism solved the
problems with transaction speed and added a lot of fresh, new ideas to the blockchain
world. But they were still not powerful enough to fit our needs: to process millions of
transactions extremely fast, to store terabytes of asset-related files, to run many high-
performance operations such as OCR of documents, patterns recognition, and Al neural
networks.

8.2. Core functionalities

he LATOKEN Transactions Blockchain is based on the EOS vision of DPOS technology
with 10-second blocks, TaPoS-technology that exposes the status of every user through
their transactions and offers direct internal references with asset Blockchain objects.

he LATOKEN Assets Blockchain is based on the Steemit (Graphene) blockchain to store
a large number of objects, including assets, holders and file references. It uses the
Aeternity idea of Decentralized Oracles to provide trustworthy connections with real-
world existing systems containing information about certain types of assets.

LATOKEN will store encrypted data via systems based on BitTorrent technology with
highly advanced improvements: sharing (node holder is not required to store the whole
file, they can only store parts of it) and encryption (user cannot decrypt a certain file until
permitted by other participants).

LATOKEN will use distributed computing systems based on technologies similar to
Apache Hadoop, adopted in the blockchain world, with a highly decentralized structure
that allows the system to process complex high-performance operations, such as text
recognition, decentralized neural networks training and execution, as well as fog
computing, on shared hardware.

LATOKEN technology is developed based on proven concepts and best practices with
the goal of providing the best-quality financial services to billions of users all over the
world. The main advantages of LATOKEN are its low costs and very fast transaction
speed.

8.3. Testing stage

Existing limitations, such as speed and transaction costs, are not important until we reach
turnover exceeding one hundred trades per hour or a combined turnover of 10 million
blocks. We tolerate Ethereum’s high commissions as the average value of transactions
exceeds $30,000 (average for a home equity loan).

When we reach limits such as speed and cost of transaction, LATOKEN will deploy our
two-part proof of stake distributed ledger:

1. First part - only transactions

2. Second part — all asset records, encrypted, shared and replicated for security
reasons and to save disc space

Blocks will be formed on a Proof-of-Stake basis:

1. Transaction records are sent to all nodes
2. Each node forms a block

8. The node with the etalon block is selected with a probability based on log of

amount of LA stored

4. The selected node broadcasts the etalon block to other nodes to compare with

their blocks

5. The block is validated and stored at every node if it is validated by 50% majority
(based on log of amount of LA stored) If a majority is not reached, the process
starts again.

If a majority is not reached, the process starts again.

8.4. Security

To ensure 100% security, we have implemented DDoS attack security and secure smart-
contracts:

e Security audit from third-party

e Escrow
e Multi-factor authentication

9. TOKEN

LA is a utility token designed to support transactions on the LATOKEN platform. It will be
purchased by cryptoholders and asset owners to do the following:

e Buy asset and other tokens on the LATOKEN platform (e.g., if you want to buy a
fraction of an asset for $100k, you need to purchase LAs equivalent to $100k)

e Pay transaction fees. A large part of these payments will be received by node
holders

Cryptoholders buy LA to purchase asset tokens traded on the LATOKEN platform and
pay for transactions. Thus, the demand for LA correlates with the trading volume on the
LATOKEN platform.

Turnover of asset-linked tokens traded on the LATOKEN platform can exceed $14 trillion
in 2025.

10. LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS
10.1. Legal implications with LA tokens

LA tokens are blockchain tokens, which are digital tokens created on a blockchain as
part of a decentralized software protocol. LA tokens are crypto-tokens issued on the
Ethereum platform on the basis of an ERC20 standard contract. LA are utility tokens
designed to support transactions on the LATOKEN platform. The utility nature of LA
token is proved by White Summers Caffee & James, a law firm that prepared a legal
memo concluding that LA is not a security.

LATOKEN.COM 34
©

LA do not grant their holder ownership or equity in the Company or the right to participate
in the control, direction, or decision making of the Company. Individuals, businesses, and
other organizations should carefully weigh the risks, costs, and benefits of acquiring LA.

We make no promises with respect to the future performance or value of LA tokens,
including no promise of inherent value, no promise of continuing payments, and no
guarantee that LA will not decrease in value or hold any particular value. LA tokens are
non-refundable. LA tokens purchasers shall accept sole and exclusive risk for the
purchase of the LA and shall recognize that the LATOKEN platform is currently in
development and may undergo significant changes. Please refer to the risks associated
with LA tokens acquisition in the relevant section of our Terms and Conditions.

This concept is fundamental to the objective of the LATOKEN platform - to spread
cryptocurrency to the global economy.

10.2. Limitations for purchasing and
using LA
USA

In July 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission ruled that some tokens can be
considered as securities and are thereby subject to the agency’s regulation. The ruling
followed an SEC investigation into the German corporation behind a group called “The
DAO” (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) that raised $150 million in ICO last year.
The DAO issued coins that were used to pursue an automated investment strategy,
which entitled token owners to receive “rewards” similar to dividends. See
httos://www.sec.gov/litigation/investreport/34-81207.pdf

SEC also pushed Protostarr, a decentralized application allowing content creators to
receive funding from fans and investors in return for channel earnings, to shut down
midway through its token sale.

By offering dividends and profit-sharing those companies were clearly offering a security
and failed the Howey Test, created by the US Supreme Court. Under the Howey Test, a
transaction is an investment contract if:

e |tis an investment of money

e There is an expectation of profits from the investment

e The investment of money is ina common enterprise

e Any profit comes from the efforts of a promoter or third party to determine whether
certain transactions are qualified as “investment contracts.”

LA is a utility token used to pay for LATOKEN platform services, such as assets
tokenization. LA is not linked to real assets (unlike asset tokens issued on the platform,
which are not yet available to US residents) and does not grant their holders ownership

LATOKEN.COM 35

in the company or any dividends. Therefore, LA cannot be seen as a security, and can
pass the hurdles of the Howey test as:

e LA are not to be purchased with a view to profit on potential appreciation of LA

themselves

e LAdo not represent a common enterprise as the LATOKEN platform is already

operational prior to the contribution

e LAshall be purchased by asset owners, or their service providers, or asset buyers

e LAdo not represent an investment contract wi
the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others. LA are not intended for
investment or currency speculation and LATOKEN reserves the right to refuse to
sell to any purchaser that cannot demonstrate a bona fide intent of purchasing
he tokens for their intended purpose. All investments decisions are made directly
by the holder of LA, independent of other holders of LA or the Management of the

10.3. Asset tokens and the LATOKEN
platform

Asset tokens are tokens created on the LATOKEN platform and linked to prices of
associated assets. Asset tokens can be issued both on our own blockchain platform or
on the Ethereum platform by a third-party Trustee who will hold the actual asset and
retain the asset owner’s option to buy back asset tokens from asset token holders at the
market price on the settlement date. If the asset refuses to exercise the option, the asset
will be sold at fiat auction by the Trustee and asset-linked token holders are entitled to
receive their corresponding share of the proceeds.

The Company hereby expressly disclaims its liability, and shall in no case be liable to any
person, for: LA being classified or treated by any government, quasi-government,
authority or public body as a kind of currency, securities, commercial paper, negotiable
instrument, investment or otherwise that may be banned, regulated or subject to certain
legal restrictions

10.4. Legal implications of smart
contracts execution

As discussed above, LA are issued on the basis of a smart contract via a blockchain
platform. A smart contract is a way to discharge obligations by means of the algorithm
input into the respective program code. As such, smart contracts shall fully comply with
the laws applicable to them, in particular, they shall ensure compliance with confidential
information legal requirements.

10.5. Data protection

Sales and purchase of LA and asset-linked tokens on the LATOKEN platform may require
personal data. Personal data is information that identifies an individual. Examples of
personal data collected may include names, addresses, email addresses, phone
numbers, and fax numbers. Personal data may be obtained in a number of ways,
including application via our website, correspondence, telephone and fax and email. We
ensure personal data protection by accepting an internal Privacy Policy and complying
with Terms of Use.

Generally, an individual is entitled to require a bank where he/she made any transaction
to remove any data regarding such transaction from the banking system. Blockchain
does not allow deleting data about any transactions concluded. As such, any user
conducting transactions via blockchain connected with purchase and/or disposal of LA
and asset tokens shall represent and warrant that they realize the above and shall provide
a waiver renouncing their right to require removal of any such data from blockchain.

LATOKEN.COM 37

We put a significant emphasis on managing possible legal and regulatory risks and works
in close partnership with a very reputable international law firm to protect its users.

10.6. KYC and anti-fraud

Due to our role as a major international business, we pay serious attention to kKnow-your
client and anti-fraud issues in order to provide our customers and cryptoholders with a
transparent business model that is safe with minimal risk.

In order to ensure that our services are not utilized by unwanted and illegal elements to
further their illegal motives, we intend to facilitate our operations by means of (i) obtaining
sufficient information about our clients and verifying customer identity; (ii) conducting
ongoing due diligence of assets tradable on the LATOKEN platform; (iii) highlighting
suspicious customers and operations.

10.7. Tax

Each customer shall declare, bear and pay all such taxes, duties, imposts, levies, tariffs
and surcharges that might be imposed by the laws and regulations of any jurisdiction as
a result of or in connection with the receipt, holding, use, purchase, appreciation, trading
or divestment of LA and each customer shall be solely liable for all such penalties, claims,
fines, punishments, liabilities or otherwise arising from his/her non-payment,
underpayment, undue payment or belated payment of any applicable tax. The Company
gives no advice and makes no representation as to the tax implication of any customer’s
decision to purchase LA.

12. ROADMAP

©

By 2025, LATOKEN aims to become the leading platform for trading asset tokens with
the capitalization of issued tokens exceeding $1.2 trillion.

2013 December

The first Business plan for

a Home Equity Lender

Valentin Preobrazhenskiy worked at hedge funds when he
discovered that emerging markets have a very lowhome loans
penetration due to low transparency forinvestors and prohibitively
high deal costs. He drafted a business plan ofa

home equity lender solving this problem.

2015 - 2016
Launch of the Home Equity Marketplace

After the launch of the marketplace 25 investors and7 banks
made more than 15 000 calls with clients via theplatform and
arranged over 1200 meetings resulting in over 1000+ deals
closed in 2016. In December 2016 the first bank made an
automated sale of a home equity loan via the platform.

2017 May - June

AlBanks - LATOKEN Development

We developed AlBanks as a blockchain platform for selling loans
and assets off the balance sheet. Because the platformallows
trading of non banking assets and eventually removes the
middleman we rebranded it to the Liquid Asset Token (LATOKEN)

First tokenized Apple shares
are sold at the LATOKEN

platform
Trading of tokens linked to prices of shares (e.g. Apple, Amazon,
Tesla) and commodities (oil, gold, silver) started at the
LATOKEN platform

2018

Scaling of asset tokens trading

Start of the full-scale trading of asset tokens linked to real estate
and artwork prices. Listing of major third party's asset tokens at
the LATOKEN platform.

2020

LATOKEN platform could become the leading
global asset token platform with a $400 billion
trading volume

The first sale of a home equity loan

We launched a home equity loans broker to develop it into P2P
online marketplace. The first deal was closed in May with a $1200
commission.

2017 April

We held a Digital Mortgage conference for 200+
banks, investors and real estate developers

Banks and real estate owners need the

blockchain to sell assets on the secondary

market.

Banks can automate selling loans off balance sheet if loans are
transparent on blockchain for secondary buyers. This enables banks
to provide the best rate available on the marketplace toany
borrower.

2017 Jul

LATOKEN wallet developed

LATOKEN wallet allows users to control account balances of
tokens, make transactions, create new tokens and link them to
assets.

2017 August - October
Token sale

The Token sale is completed in several rounds with ~$20m raised from
11,000 contributors.

2019
Apps for new specific assets are
added to the LATOKEN platform

2025

Capitalization of tokens issued
at LATOKEN platform may reach $1.2 trillion

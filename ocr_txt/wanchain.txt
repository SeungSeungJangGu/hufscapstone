Abstract

Digital currency, represented by Bitcoin and
Ethereum, is blazing through traditional
inancial systems with the force of a prairie
ire. Although blockchain technology is still in
he initial stages of development, its transpar-
ent mechanisms and open concepts show
remendous vitality. Wanchain seeks to link

he present to the future, through the explora-

ion and implementation of blockchain tech-
nology.

Wanchain aims to build a distributed “bank”.
Just as traditional banks are the infrastructure
of the current financial framework, Wanchain
seeks to build a new, distributed infrastruc-
ture of digital assets to form an improved,
modern framework - an ambitious goal
indeed.

Wanchain connects and exchanges value
between different blockchain ledgers in a
distributed manner. It uses the latest cryp-
tographic theories to build a non-proprietary

cross-chain protocol and a distributed ledger
hat records both cross-chain and intra-chain
ransactions. Any blockchain network, wheth-
er a public, private or consortium chain, can
integrate with Wanchain to establish connec-
ions between different ledgers and perform
ow cost inter-ledger asset transfers. The Wan-
chain ledger supports not only smart

contracts, but also token exchange privacy

protection.

With Wanchain, any institution or individual
can set up their own virtual teller window in
the “bank” and provide services such as loan
origination, asset exchanges, credit payments
and transaction settlements based on digital
assets. Under the guarantee of “banks” based
on the blockchain infrastructure, more people
can participate in financial services based on
digital assets. To describe it more accurately,
Wanchain is a distributed super-financial
market based on blockchain.

1/ Wanchain Design Concept

1.1/ Blockchain Emergence and Significance

Friedrich A. Hayek, the eminent Austrian econ-
omist, believes that if we let currencies com-
pete in the market by survival of the fittest, like
other commodities, market mechanisms can
ilter out the most appropriate currency for us,
just like it does for those other commodities.

n January 2009, the first Bitcoin block was
mined. The emergence of Bitcoin transcend-
ed Hayek’ s ideal state where responsibility

or controlling the total amount of money ina
system is borne by specific institutions,

whose self-interest keeps the total currency

amount at a level acceptable to most users.

The switch from credit authorization by institu-
tions to inviolable mathematical laws for
recording the exchange of value is another
great innovation. In essence, currency is a
consensus. It is an agreed upon accounting
representation for a more convenient
exchange of value. Reviewing mankind’ s
financial history, from the bartering of one
thing for another, to the use of cattle, sheep or
shells as universal equivalents, to the use of
precious metals as money, and the current use
of paper currency with a strong credit base,

human currency is approaching abstract math-

ematics and its nature as symbols or ledgers is
more apparent. Blockchains make human
accounting principles align closer to mathe-
matics.lt helps the entire accounting system
get

away from control by a single institution and
move ina more fair and transparent direction.

The concept of Financial Inclusion seeks to give
disadvantaged people and small enterprises,
worldwide, better access to the financial system
and low-cost financial services. Two and a half
billion people in the world are unable to use
banks, open savings accounts or obtain credit
cards and are therefore separated from the

global economy. Cross-border remittances
hrough banks incur high fees. Ordinary inves-
ors can only buy relatively low-end financial

products from banks and other financial institu-

ions and can't take part in early-stage invest-
ments of technology companies such as Google
and Alibaba before
difficult for many smal

hey are listed. It is also
o medium enterprises
to obtain loan support from banks, despite
good credit and outstanding performance,
because they are not the target customers of
traditional banks under the 80/20 rule.

Georg Hegel said “Reality is a historical process,”

and the emergence of blockchain technology is
changing the aforementioned situations. When
Venezuela recently devalued its currency, Bitcoin

became a popular safe-haven asset. Workers in
foreign countries, such as the Philippines, remit
their income to their weak hometown banking
facilities through blockchain networks. Investors
who participated in the ICO of well-known block-
projects, such as Ethereum, received returns
hundreds of times the size of their initial invest-
ments. Blockchain technology is pushing Inclu-
sive Finance to brand new heights.

As of June 2017 there are thousands of digital
currencies based on blockchain technology
with a total market value of over $100 billion,

and the number and value of digital curren-
cies continues to grow. Digital currency is
becoming more acceptable as a form of
payment in financial transactions; many
organizations are exploring ways to record
traditional forms of assets, such as commer-
cial bills and loyalty points, into blockchains,
usually in the form of consortium chains.

Digital asset exchanges, which are similar to
raditional financial institutions, have
emerged. These exchanges perform the
banking function of exchanging digital

assets. They are a platform for buying and
rading tokens, similar to those of a stock

exchange. A platform for cross-border token
ransfers performs functions similar to
cross-border bank remittances.

However, these platforms, in various degrees,
are operating in a centralized manner, which
not only brings about the security risks of
centralization, but also blocks the wider adop-
ion of blockchain technology.

Based on this phenomenon, we need a
distributed "bank'
currencies and digital assets can be trans-

where different digital

erred in, transferred out and exchanged by
blockchains. We need a place where financial

products and contracts based on digital
currencies and digital assets

WANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD | 02

can be created and implemented and where
he transaction privacy can be effectively
protected. Of course, such "banks" will be com-
pletely different from traditional banks, except
or some functions such as debit and credit,
remittance, settlement, and sale of financial

products. With corresponding ability and capi-
al strength, any organization or individual can
set up their own business windows. They can
provide various services, under the guarantee

of a distributed blockchain infrastructure, to
provide more financial services for more

people. More accurately, this is a future finan-

cial infrastructure based on digital assets and a
distributed financial market.

1.2/ Design Background

In the early days of traditional banks, currency
exchange was their main purpose, and func-
tions such as currency custody, payments,
settlements and remittances were gradually
developed. At last, modern banks with depos-
its and loans as their main business were

born. It can be said that a bank is a ledger
recording debtor-creditor relationships. Every
receipt, payment and transfer of funds is, in
fact, a change of corresponding assets in a

bank ledger that supports more than one
asset. An exchange settlement among differ-
ent banks is actually an asset record change

on different ledgers. It must be ensured that
the assets are not double spent, regardless of
whether the asset changes are in the same
ledger or in different ledgers. In general, the
increase or decrease in the amount of an
asset in a ledger must correspond to an
equivalent opposite change in another
ledger. The block chain provides an excellent
solution to the problem of double spending
in the same ledger in different accounts. Solv-
ing the problem of transferring assets among
different blockchain ledgers is key to the

wider application of blockchain technology.
Wanchain requires a distributed approach to

support the access of different blockchains

and the transfer of assets - that is, to support
cross-chain transactions.

Effective protection of users’ privacy is one of
he foundations of traditional banking. Any
inancial transaction is needed to be protect-
ed froma third party. Wanchain needs to have
he same capabilities.

Wanchain is a distributed financial market. In

principle, any organization or individual can
develop and provide their own financial
services based on Wanchain. It requires Wan-

chain, a blockchain infrastructure, to support
the programmable smart contract function.

In summation, Wanchain is designed under
such a context.

1.3/ Design Objectives

In order to build a more widely spread block-
chain technology and digital asset applications,
Wanchain has set the following objectives
based on the research on cross-chain technolo-
gy, combined with the characteristics of decen-
tralization and its application scenarios:

WANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD | 03

Cross-Chain Asset Transfer:

* Connect existing major digital currency
networks (such as Bitcoin and Ethereum) and
completing the asset exchanges without
modifying the mechanism of original chains.
This integrates newly generated digital
currency networks with Wanchain at a very
low cost.

+ Integrate consortium chains with Wanchain.
This fulfills the functions of transferring assets
from original chains to Wanchain, transferring
assets from Wanchain back to the original
chains, and trading various assets on Wan-
chain.

* Ensure the security of cross-chain transac-
tions and the stability of cross-chain transac-
tion services.

Transaction Privacy Protection:
+ Allow trading parties to choose to conduc
transactions with privacy protection.

+ Provide privacy protection for transfers and
exchanges of digital assets.

+ Provide anonymous protection of digital asse
holders.

Functional Extensibility:
+ Become a distributed platform for the
exchange of various digital currencies.

* Carry out deposit and loan business for
different digital currencies.

* Conduct transactions of digital assets using
digital currency as a medium.

+ Issue and trade brand new digital financial
assets.
1.4/ Positioning

Through the establishment of links among
different blockchains, the inter-ledger trans-
fer of assets can be achieved, providing an
infrastructure for financial applications based
on digital currencies and digital assets. We
seek to give full play to the blockchain func-
ion of carrying and transferring value, and
he equal and open concept of blockchain.

From a blockchain technology development

secret-sharing, a ring signature scheme

perspective, applies

multi-party computation,
based on elliptic curve cryptography, a
one-time account generation mechanism,
and many other cutting-edge cryptographic
echnologies. Wanchain also solves the priva-
cy protection problem of smart contract
oken transactions. To some extent, Wan-

chain is an advanced cryptographic applica-

ion that solves the real problems of block-
chains and represents the developmental

direction of the blockchain technologies.
Wanchain has a professional cryptography
research team to apply cryptography to the
blockchain field and contribute to the indus-
try asa whole.

From a blockchain application perspective,
Wanchain is more than just a blockchain proj-
ect of achieving cross-chain transactions and
interoperability of multiple blockchains.
Wanchain is a complete blockchain develop-
ment platform. Wanchain achieves the func-
tion of cross-chain transactions, but it is also

a blockchain running independently; it

contracts, and has privacy protection mecha-
nisms for smart contract token transactions.
Any developer may develop applications on
Wanchain in accordance with its application
development standards.

2.1/ Architecture

2.1.1 Distributed Ledger and Smart Con-
tract Virtual Machine

Wanchain is an Ethereum-based generic
ledger that runs applications independently,
with account models and smart contracts
that implement various original Ethereum
functions. On top of those, we added
cross-chain transactions and achieved smart

contract token privacy protection.

2.1.2 Native Coin

Wancoin is the native coin of Wanchain. Both
cross- and intra-chain transactions consume
a certain amount of Wancoin. Wancoin is also
used in security deposits for the cross-chain
verification nodes.

2.1.3 Consensus Mechanism

Wanchain adopts a Proof of Stake (POS)
consensus mechanism for ordinary transac-
tions and implements consensus and incentive

mechanisms for cross-chain transactions.
These mechanisms are discussed in the
following sections.

2.1.4 Intra-Chain Transactions

Common transaction methods in Wanchain
are the same as in Ethereum, but we have
added a privacy protection mechanism that is
implemented

through a ring signature

scheme and a one-time account mechanism.

2.1.5 Cross-Chain Integration

Both blockchains and assets that integrate with
Wanchain first need to be registered on Wan-
chain to make sure that they can be uniquely
identified. These functions are completed via
chain and asset registration protocols.

For cross-chain transactions, we use secure
computing and threshold
secret-sharing joint anchoring schemes to

multi-party

achieveminimal-cost integration through the
cross-chain communication protocol without
changing the original chain’ s implementa-
ion. Wanchain is a complete platform that
can be applied to broad financial applica-
ions with privacy protection for smart
contract token transactions of public and
private chains. What’s more important is

hat other blockchains developed on Wan-
chain are equivalent to the homogeneous

blockchains of Wanchain and have the same
cross-chain mechanism and seamless inte-
gration with each other.

2.1.6 Cross-Chain Transactions

When an unregistered asset is transferred
from the original chain to Wanchain, Wan-
chain will create a new asset using a built-in
asset template to deploy a new smart
contract based on the cross-chain transac-
tion information. When a registered asset is
transferred from the original chain to Wan-

chain, Wanchain will issue the corresponding
equivalent tokens in the existing contracts to

ensure that the original chain assets can still
be traded on Wanchain.

In order to describe the transfer of assets
between a public chain and Wanchain, we’ ll
illustrate an example using Ethereum:

Transfer-In Process: Alice and Bob have
accounts on Ethereum and Wanchain respec-
tively, and Alice needs to transfer 10 ETH to Bob.

Alice makes a cross-chain transaction request
using the Wanchain wallet and initiates a
transfer on Ethereum, with the recipient being
an Ethereum cross-chain Locked Account.
Wanchain’s validator node receives the
cross-chain transaction request, verifies that
the transaction has been recorded on Ethere-
um, and creates a new smart contract token
ETH' (ether prime) on Wanchain, which corre-
sponds to the ETH needing to be cross-trans-
ferred to Bob on Wanchain.

Transfer-Back Process: Bob wants to trans-
fer the 10 ETH he received from Alice to Chris.

Bob uses his Wanchain wallet to initiate a
cross-chain transaction with the ETH’ asset
contract. Upon receiving the request, the
validator node locks the corresponding 10
ETH’ assets. After successfully locking the
assets, the validator node uses the threshold
secret-sharing mechanism to create an

transfer-back processes between Wanchain
and the public chain, which is essentially the
same as that between Wanchain and the
private chain. For details of the asset transfer
process and data transmission process,

2.2.1 Fully Decentralized and No Trust-
ed Third-Party Participation

Currently, most cross-chain transactions are
conducted through exchanges and third-par-
ty trading platforms. But the blockchain
cross-chain transaction platforms need the
involvement of a_ third-party custodian
account. This leaves the secure and smooth

completion of the entire transaction to the

reliability of third-party participants. The

locked account mechanism of Wanchain
uses fully decentralized, multi-party comput-
ing and threshold secret-sharing technology
to perform the account management without
the need of any third-party participation or
credit endorsement of any entities.

2.2.2 Unmodified Original Chain and
Low Integration Threshold

n our cross-chain transaction solution, the
account locking mechanism doesn’t use
wo-way anchoring, and doesn’ t need addi-
ional script extensions to identify and verify
he Simple Payment Verification (SPV) proof. All

on data is transmitted into the node

ransac
network of the original chain after reconstruc-

ion and integration on the Wanchain validator

node. The format of the validator node isin line
with the transaction type requirements. This
enables certain operations and computations
of cross-chain transactions to be completed

within the Wanchain network, without the
need to modify the various original chain
mechanisms. This allows existing public and
private chains, based on other platforms, to be
integrated with Wanchain with a low integra-

tion threshold, thus reducing the cost o
cross-chain transactions.

2.2.3 Cryptography Based _ Security
Guarantee
echanisms used by many — existing

cross-chain exchanges often use logical secu-
rity, relying on participants to look out for
heir own self-interest. In other words, the
participants will not break the cross-chain
ransactions at the expense of damaging their

“

own interests. This can be called “The

Hypothesis of Rational Participants”.

In addition to the application of original elliptic

WANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD I 08

curve cryptography to ensure the security of
the original signature solution, Wanchain uses:

+ threshold secret-sharing technology,

+ the locked account management solution
based on multi-party computing,

+ the privacy protection mechanism for smart
contract token transactions, based on ring
signatures and one-time accounts.

All subsequent operations are automatically
done between validator nodes of Wanchain
and don’t need coordination from transac-
tion participants after initiating a cross-chain
transaction. This leaves the smooth operation
of the entire system to the security of cryp-
tographic algorithms.

2.2.4 Cross-Chain Transaction Privacy
Protection

n Wanchain’ s cross-chain transaction solu-
ion, assets on the original chain exist in the
orm of smart contract tokens after they are
ransferred into Wanchain. On one hand, we
hide the initiators of smart contract token
ransactions in a collection of accounts, via
ring signature technology, so that they are not

raceable. On the other hand, we allow

one-time use of accounts in smart contracts,
so the corresponding relationship with the
original account on Wanchain cannot be
established. By using a combination of the
above two methods, Wanchain achieves the
confidentiality of smart contract token trans-
actions, allows cross-chain transactions of
assets under privacy protection, expands
application scenarios and provides a better
user experience.
WANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD | 09

3/ Cross-Chain Communi-
cation Protocol

The Wanchain cross-chain communication
protocol defines the specifications for data
transmission between Wanchain and other
chains, allowing interconnections and data flow
between chains. The following paragraphs
describe the module functions and data trans-
mission processes.

3.1/ Functional Modules

The cross-chain communication protocol consists of
hree functional modules:

Registration module: this module provides two
unctions.

The first is to register the original chain partici-

pating in cross-chain transactions. This gener-
ates a unique ID through specific algorithm
rules for the original chain, maintaining the ID
registry of the original chains to avoid fraud
caused by false chains.

The second function is to register the asset to be
transferred. This generates a unique ID through
specific algorithm rules for the asset to ensure
the uniqueness of the assets.

Cross-chain Transaction Data Transmission
Module: this module provides three functions.

The first function is that the user on the origi-
nal chain makes the cross-chain transaction
request to Wanchain. This is the starting point
of the Wanchain asset transfer-in transaction.

The second function is the acknowledge-
ment of receipt of Wanchain’ s validator node
returning success or not.

The third function is that Wanchain’ s valida-
tor node sends the legal transaction to the
original chain to complete the transfer-back
process.

Transaction Status Query Module: this
module mainly provides the function of que-
rying the confirmation status of the asset
transfer-in transaction on the original chain
to Wanchain’ s locked account and the trans-
fer-back transaction of Wanchain’ s locked
account to the original chain. These are the
control marks of the cross-chain transaction
progress.

3.2/. Data Transmission

Process

Here we take the user Alice, who wants to
transfer value from an original (Ori) chain to
Wanchain, as an example to illustrate the
asset transfer-in data transmission process:
WANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD | 10

Step1: Alice initiates a transaction OriTx with her OriAccount on the original chain to send an
asset OriAssetID to Wanchain’ s locked account LockedAccount and broadcasts the cross-chain
transaction request InterTxReq to Wanchain via the cross-chain transaction data transmission
module.

The function takes the transaction data as parameters, such that:

OriTxInfo=(OriBlockNum,OriTx)
InterTxReq=(OriAccount,OriChain!ID,OriAssetID,value,OriTxInfo,sig)

Step2: :The cross-chain transaction proof node (Voucher) on Wanchain receives a cross-chain
transaction request and checks whether the transaction has been confirmed on the original chain
through the transaction status query module.

The function Token Locked Flag (TLF) takes OriTxInfo, OriChain|ID and OriAssetID as parameters,
such that:

TLF=CheckCommitment(OriChainID,OriAssetID,OriTxInfo)

Step3: The cross-chain transaction proof node (Voucher) gathers consensus on the TLF results
and if TLF=true, then OriTx has been confirmed. The verification node (Validator) receives the data
TLF=true, and then checks the asset registry of the original chain. If it is a new asset, the asset will
be registered and added into the registry. The public account WANAccount, maintained by the
Validator initiates a transaction WANTx, deploys a smart contract for the new asset and distributes
tokens of Value for OriAccount in the contract. If it is a registered asset, the transaction WANTx
distributes tokens of Value for OriAccount directly into the existing asset contract. If WANTx is
confirmed, the Validator uses the cross-chain transaction data transmission module to reply to

Alice about the successful receipt of the cross-chain transaction:
response=(WANAccount,InterTxReq, True,addresSsc,sigvalidator)

If WANTx becomes invalid, the locked account management node (Storeman) initiates a transac-
tion on the original chain to transfer Alice’ s locked asset back to her account OriAccount.

If the consensus result for TLF is confirmed by the Voucher as false, the cross-chain transaction is
considered invalid.

Figure 3.1: Cross-Chain Data Process from Ethereum to Wanchain

In the next example, we have user Bob transferring Value from Wanchain back to the original
chain to illustrate the asset transfer-back data transmission process:

Step1: Bob uses BobAccount on Wanchain to send the transaction WANTx, which calls the asset
transfer-back function of the smart contract corresponding to the asset of the original chain.

Step2: The Validator calls the smart contract after receiving the transaction. The Voucher tests
the results of the contract execution and gathers consensus. If TLF=true, which means that the
token value for Bob in the contract has been locked, the Storeman then broadcasts the transac-
tion of Locked Account, which transfers Value to BobAccount on the original chain, via the
cross-chain transaction data transmission module:

OriTx=(LockedAccount,BobAccount,value, sigstoreman)

The Voucher checks whether this transfer is confirmed via the transaction status query module,
and gathers consensus on confirmation flag TL F.

Step3: If the Token Unlocked Flag (TUF) = true, the Validator will clear the assets locked in the
smart contract; if TUF=false, it means that transaction on the original chain is not confirmed and
the Storeman will re-initiate the transaction.

is subject to the threat of 51% power attack,

4.1/ Verification Node Con- while similarly, the POS consensus algorithm

sensus Mechanism is theoretically subject to a threat of collusion
attack of participants. As a result, Wanchain

Wanchain adopts the Proof of Stake (POS) introduces this mechanism to increase the

consensus algorithm, the description of which opportunity cost of verification node collu-

can be found in a series of papers from Ethere- sion, allowing Wanchain to record cross-chain

um, so itis not detailed here. Theoretically, the transactions faithfully and follow the

Proof of Work (POW) consensus algorithm is cross-chain processes objectively.
In short, the verification nodes on Wanchain
are divided into three categories:

*Cross-chain transaction proof nodes (Vouch-
ers)

* Locked account management nodes (Store-
men)

* General verification nodes (Validators)

Vouchers are used to provide proof of transac-
tions between the original account and the
locked account. A Voucher is required to pay a
certain security deposit. The higher the
if
provides will be adopted. If the proof is found
to be false, the security deposit will be

deposit, the greater chance the proof

deducted from the holding account and the
authorization of the Voucher is revoked.

The Storeman, upon receiving a notice, is
responsible for computing the signature
shares according to its own part of the key and
merging the signatures parts into a complete
signature for the lock account. When this is
done, operations related to the locked
account are performed (see the specific
process in section 4.3).

The Validator informs the Storeman of opera-
tional actions related to the locked account
and complete the record of operations on the
Wanchain whenever a transaction proof
reaches a consensus.

The security of the Wanchain network
depends on its overall value. When the value
of all cross-chain transactions is far greater
than the overall value of the Wanchain

WANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD I 13

network, i.e. where the gains for collusion are
greater than the opportunity cost, the risk of
collusion between verification nodes will
increase.

On the contrary, when the overall value of the
Wanchain is sufficiently high, collusion
between verification nodes means giving up
margin held by them that are staked to the
tokens on Wanchain, greatly increasing the
opportunity cost of collusion. The nodes will

not collude to destroy the entire network for

cross-chain asset risking their existing inter-
ests and long-term income, thus reducing
he risk of collusion.

Furthermore, the more cross-chain transac-
ions are involved in the Wanchain, the great-
er the value carried by Wanchain. The higher
he risk for verification nodes to collude, the
more secure the entire network, which will
attract more and more cross-chain transac-

ions. This is an interactive process, with the
value transferring to the Wanchain network.
Wanchain is bound to become increasingly
robust.

4.2/ Incentive Mechanism

4.2.1 Verification Nodes

The Vouchers receive transaction fees from
the corresponding shares as a security depos-
it. If the proof provided is found to be false,
the security deposit is deducted from the
holding account and the node authority
status will be revoked.
AValidator completes the recording of transac-
tions on Wanchain to gain a part of the transac-
tion fees.

A Storeman receives a corresponding key
share according to the stake it holds and calcu-
lates the corresponding signature share to be
added into the transaction. The Storeman
obtains the transaction fee involved in the
verification transaction according to the key
share proportion. If the key share information
is offline or lost, the transaction fee cannot be
claimed. Likewise, if the nodes sign the error
ransaction, the credentials of the Storeman
will also be taken away.

n summary, the verification node incentive
mechanism will motivate the Vouchers to
provide correct transaction proof, the Valida-
ors to complete the recording of Wanchain

aithfully, and the Storemen to stay online and
safely keep their own key shares.

4.2.2 General Nodes

Only those holding a high enough stake in the
Wanchain network can become a verification
node. Nodes that fail to be verification nodes
are known as general nodes. The general
nodes cannot participate in the verification
process of cross-chain transactions, but they
can entrust the stakes they hold to the trusted

verification nodes. The entrusted verification

nodes distribute the transaction fees they
receive to the general nodes in proportion to

the entrusted stakes. If the entrusted verifica-

tion node is punished, general nodes will bear

a corresponding loss.

WANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD | 14

Such an incentive mechanism ensures that
stakeholders in Wanchain can earn stake-re-
lated benefits while also motivating them to
entrust their stakes to trusted verification
nodes. This improves the security and stabili-
ty of Wanchain.

4.3/ Locked Account Gen-
eration Scheme

The Locked Account Generation Scheme is
based on secure multi-party computation
and threshold key sharing.

4.3.1 Introduction

Secure multi-party computation is both the
theoretical basis of distributed cryptography
and a fundamental problem of distributed
computing. The theory arises from “Yao’s
Millionaires’ Problem” in 1982. Simply speak-
ing, secure multi-party computation is about
a group of participants, referred as Pi...... Pn,
who work together to compute the function
fla, bees Xo (Yay ye) securely. Then inputs
of function f are held, one each, by n partici-
pants. Pi holds the secret input x, and after
computation Pi gets output yi. In this situa-
ion, security requires that even if some
participants cheat in the computing process,
he correctness of the computing result must
be ensured. This means that when computa-
ions are completed, every participant must

get the correct output y and all input from

participants remain privileged. Pican get no

In this scheme, a key is divided into n pieces The Locked Account Generation Scheme is
and distributed to n participants. Every partic- as follows:

Step1: Select a secure random number.

There are n validators on Wanchain, named as P.......Pn. Each validator selects a secure random
number di and k-degree polynomial fi (x)Hditainxt--+aikix .Thescheme sends fi (j)to other
validators through secure channel and broadcasts diG to every node of the network, G being the
base point of the elliptic curve.

Step2: Check the correctness of the messages.
After receiving other validators’ messages, P;will check the correctness of the messages:

flag=Check(fy (j),..-fv (j))

If flag=true, then P; accepts and saves it locally.
WANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD I 16

If flag=false, then P; rejects it and requires other validators to resend the messages.

Step3: Receive key share.
When all messages are sent and checked out, then every validator gets their key share:

key_sharex=)\(=1 f(k) , k=1,......n
Step4: Compute the address of the Locked Account.
Locked_Account_Address=GenerateAddress(d, G.......,dn G)

After all the operations above, the Locked Account is generated, and its key is divided into n key
shares and then distributed to n validators of Wanchain.

Any operation on the Locked Account will require at least k of n validators’ participation to
complete.

4.3.3 Scheme Generation

During the generation process of the Locked Account, the private key is never generated or recon-
structed in the entire network. Generating the signature of the Locked Account needs at least k
validators’ participation. They compute the signature shares separately through the key shares
they hold, and then reconstruct the full signature using signature shares.

The Locked Account Signature Scheme is as follows:

Step1: Compute the Signature Shares

A quantity of n Wanchain Validators compute signature shares of the message using key shares
they hold:

signature_sharej=Generate_Sig(m,key_share;)

Step2: Send out the signatures shares.
Each Validator sends its signature share to other Validators.

Step3: Reconstruct and broadcast the complete signature.
When a Validator receives more than k signature shares, it will reconstruct the full signature and
broadcast it to other Validators:

signature=Construct_Sig(signature_share.......,signature_sharex)

Step 4: The full signature of Locked Account is generated

4.3.4 Advantages

Almost all cross-chain transaction schemes
need a mechanism to lock the assets of the
original chain. Only when the triggering
condition is met will the locked assets be
unlocked and returned to the original
account or some other account.

Existing mechanisms use the Hashed
TimeLock Contract scheme, the Trusted
Third-Party Escrow Account scheme and the
Multi Signature Account scheme.

Compared to these mechanisms, the Locked
Account scheme has several advantages:

+ Fully Decentralized without Third-Par-
ty Participation

The Locked Account is generated through
secure multi-party computation. In this process,
no participation or endorsement of a trusted
third-party is needed. All we need is information
interaction and computation by Validators
through secure channels. Compared to the

trusted third-party escrow account scheme, the
Locked Account generation scheme has a lower
cost and more flexibility.

+ Secure and stable

The key for the Locked Account is distributed
to validators of Wanchain through Shamir s
Secret Sharing Scheme (a.k.a. Shamir’ s (k,
n)-threshold secret sharing scheme). Each
Validator holds one piece of the key share.
Even when some Validators are offline or lose
their key shares, the signature of the Locked
Account can still be generated, and the trans-
action can be executed with the participation

of at least k validators. Therefore, the Locked
Account generation scheme can ensure that

WANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD | 18

the whole system operates with stability and
security even in unforeseen circumstance
where some part of network paralyzes or lose
some key shares. At the same time, the key
share of every validator is updated periodical-
ly or when a triggering condition is met, in
order to eliminate the threat caused by key
share exposure.

+ Easy Integration and Efficient Data Stor-
age

Any operation on the Locked Account is done
by the original transaction of the original
chain. No new transaction type or verification
mechanism is added. So theoretically, any
chain can be integrated with Wanchain, and
he cost is negligible. At the same time, com-
pared to the multi-signature account scheme
hat relies on the logic of smart contracts to
achieve multiparty management, the Locked
Account generation scheme achieves multi-
party management through principles of cryp-

ography. The final transaction has only one
signature, not several signatures. Thus, this
mechanism is more efficient on data storage.

4.4/ Smart Contract Token
Transaction Anonymity

On Wanchain, ring-signature and one-time
accounts are implemented to achieve ano-
nymity in smart contract token transactions.
Ring-signature mixes the transaction sender
in a set of fake members to make the sender
untraceable. A one-time account is generated
for each transaction, so it cannot be linked to
the true owner.
4.4.1 One-Time Account System
As a foundation for anonymity, the one-time
account system is especially important. Each
user has only one main account and lots o
sub-accounts. So, if anyone wants to keep
anonymous in a smart contract token trans-
action, he needs to generate an associated
account to create a one-time main accoun
together with his original one.

On Wanchain, Alice has an original accoun
(A,a). Ais the public key and a is the private

WANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD | 19

key. To create a one-time main account, she
generates a new account (B,b). The main
account is ((A,B),(a,b)) with main public key
A,B), main private key (a,b) and scan key
A,b). Usually a sub-account is generated by a
ransaction sender for the receiver. For exam-
ple, Bob wants to send some tokens to Alice.
He invokes the function OTA_GenerateAc-
count( ) with Alice’s main account as a
parameter to generate Alice’s sub-account
A1,S)):

(Az,S1 )=OTA_GenerateAccount((A,B))

Alice invokes the function OTA_ScanAccount( ) with her own scan key to scan every sub-account

(A,S):

flag=OTA_ScanAccount((AiS: ),(A,b))

When it comes to (A1,S;), the flag returns true. So (Ai,S1) belongs to Alice. She invokes the function

OTA_GetPrivateKey( ) with her main private key to get the private key of (Ax,S1):

sk=OTA_GetPrivateKey((A;,S; ),(a,b))

In the One-time account system, the scan key helps Alice learn which sub-account belongs to her

and the main private key guarantees that she is the only one who can get the private key. No one

could change the owner of a sub-account without the associated scan key and get the private key

without main private key. Therefore, anonymity and security is guaranteed.

4.4.2 Ring Signature Scheme

The Ring Signature scheme was first provided in 2001 by Rivest and others. It is a special kind of
Group Signature scheme. A Group Signature scheme needs a trusted center and secure setup,
which would mean that the signer can be traced by the trust center. The Ring Signature scheme
solves this serious problem by removing the trusted center and secure setup.

Since the Ring Signature scheme was introduced, many practical schemes have been designed
based on the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), such as the trapdoor technique. Generally speak-
ing, there are four kinds of Ring Signature schemes: Trapdoor Ring Signature, Linkable Ring Signa-
ure, Anonymity Revocable Ring Signature, and Deniable Ring Signature.

To provide anonymity in Smart Contract Token transactions, the Ring Signature scheme based on
ECC is implemented in Wanchain.

There are three parts to the Ring Signature scheme. Details are as below, taking the signer (Px) as
an example:
WANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD | 21

GEN: Get the public parameters. The signer generates a public key set including n members from
the world state through the function GeneratePublicKeySet( ) with the public key as a parameter:

publickeyset=GeneratePublicKeySet(P)

The signer makes a key image I by invoking GenerateKeylmage( ) with the public key and private
key:

1=GenerateKeyImage((P,x))

SIG: Generate the ring signature. The signer generates the ring signature of message m through
GenerateRingSignature( ) with publickeyset, I and x:

ringsig=GenerateRingSignature(m,publickeyset,I,x)

VER: Verify the ring signature. The signer verifies the ring signature of message m through
VerifyRingSignature() which returns true or false with publickeyset, I and ringsig:

flag=VerifyRingSignature(m,publickeyset,Lringsig)
If the flag is true, the ring signature is valid. Otherwise it’s invalid.
In the Ring Signature scheme, the key image and ring signature cannot be matched with the signer

who is among the publickeyset. Anyone can verify whether the signature is valid or not, but no one
is able to identify the signer.

4.4.3 Privacy Protection Transaction Flow

Alice wants to send some tokens to Carl in the smart contract whose address is SCAddress. Alice’ s
main account is (A,B) with main private key (a,b). Carl*s main account is (C,D) with the main
private key (c,d). Alice has a sub-account Onetime_accountl with the private key sk1 in the smart
contract. The transaction flow is as follows:

Alice sends a transaction:
Step1: Alice generates a one-time account for Carl with his main account:

Onetime_account2=OTA_GenerateAccount((C,D))

Step2: Alice generates the signature for the transaction data in the smart contract through Gen-
erateSignature( ) with skl and makes the final data Payload:

sig=GenerateSignature(Onetime_account1,Onetime_account2,value,nonce)
Payload=(Onetime_account1,Onetime_account2,value,nonce,sig)
Step3: Alice generates the public key set:
publickeyset=GeneratePublicKeySet(A)
Step4: Alice generates the key image and makes the transaction message m:

1=GenerateKeylmage((A,a))
m=(publickeyset,SC_Address,Payload)

Step5: Alice generates the ring signature and makes the final transaction data:

ringsig=GenerateRingSignature(m,publickeyset,I,a)

transaction=(publickeyset,SCadaress,Payload,Lringsig)

Step6: Alice broadcasts transaction on the Wanchain.

The Validator verifies a transaction:
Step1: The Validator receives transaction and makes the transaction data m to verify the ring
signature:

m=(publickeyset,SC_Address,Payload)
flag=Verify RingSignature(m,publickeyset,Lringsig)
WANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD I 23

Step2: If flag is true, the Validator goes to step 3. Otherwise the transaction is invalid and thrown
out.

Step3: The Validator invokes the smart contract with Payload as a parameter. Then the smart
contract verifies the signature in Payload and executes the transfer.

After step 3, the transaction is committed on Wanchain. Carl scans the sub-accounts with his scan
key and recognizes that Onetime_account2 belongs to himself. Then he gets the private key for

Onetime_account2 with his main private key. Therefore, he takes the tokens of Value.

5/ Wanchain Applications

5.1/ Borrowing and Lending

As digital currency becomes an important
medium of value exchange and a value stor-
age carrier, using it to create new value and
generate income is an inevitable trend. For
example, Bitcoin is used to invest in block-
chain mining businesses and other ICO proj-
ects. With the increasing number of applica-
tions for digital currency, direct investment
opportunities for

digital currency have

increased.

People who use digital currencies to create
value need more digital currencies, and
people who hold digital currencies want to
increase their value, so the demand for
borrowing and lending digital currencies will

increase.Take Ethereum (ETH) for example. A
service provider uses a smart contract to
create a deposit application and set the inter-
est rate on Wanchain. A user transfers ETH
from the Ethereum blockchain to the corre-
sponding Wanchain smart contract address
through a cross-chain transaction. The
deposit on Wanchain releases a correspond-
ing voucher (tokens on Wanchain that are
similar to deposit bank receipts) to the user’ s
account on Wanchain. The smart contract
then automatically calculates the interest.
When the user needs to withdraw the depos-
it, the voucher will be transferred back to an
intermediary address, and a cross-chain

transaction is executed. The ETH corre-

sponding to the voucher is unlocked on the
original chain and transferred back to the
original user’ s account. The deposit reserves
(the locked assets on the original chain corre-
sponding to the intermediary address) are
always transparent.

5.2/ Payment and Settle-
ment

More and more businesses accept digital
assets, like Bitcoin, asa means of payment. In
the future, there will be more applications in
which a variety of digital currencies are used
for payments. Currently, there are many
payment methods such as VISA, Paypal and
Alipay, each with their own payment proce-
dures and settlement processes. Wanchain is
a distributed multi-currency platform, inte-
grating different banking ledgers into one
unified ledger. Any business or user can
install the Wanchain wallet to implement

multi-currency payments and settlements
without having to install multiple digital
currency wallets.

5.3/ Transaction and Ex-
change

At present, the completion of digital currency
exchange depends on centralized exchanges
and over-the-counter markets. All transac-
tions are based on trust of the exchanges and
intermediaries. After multiple currencies are
integrated with Wanchain, the exchanges or

WANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD I 24

intermediaries can achieve multi-currency
auction trading and one-to-one curb transac-
ions via smart contracts. The privacy protec-
ion transaction mechanism on Wanchain
provides support for transactions that require
privacy protection. Wanchain allows for
importing digital currency into Wanchain,
aunching private transactions on Wanchain
and transferring digital currency back to the
original chain. To some extent, the privacy

protection of the original chain is achieved by
masking the fund tracking paths.

5.4/ Investment and
Financing

There is a trend toward traditional institutions
to use consortium chains to hold assets such
as commercial bills, loyalty points, future
earning rights, accounts receivable and so on.
In the future, more financial assets will be
recorded on distributed ledgers based on
consortium chains. When these consortium
chains are linked to Wanchain, they become

financial asset providers, and the investors
can use their digital currencies to buy these
assets. As in the traditional banking business,
it's akin to buying financial products in a
bank. The difference is that more intermediar-
ies can participate and that the asset holders
can carry out financing directly.

An ICO has become an important means of
financing in the blockchain space, and this
trend is spreading into non-blockchain areas.
More and more projects, especially the ones
based on Ethereum, directly use smart
contracts for ICO, which makes the whole
process more transparent and fair. But |COs
that only use Ether cause inconvenience to
investors holding other digital currencies. On
Wanchain, the ICO issuer can issue a smart
contract that supports multi-currency invest-
ments. More conveniently, investors can
invest by using Ethereum, Bitcoin or any
other blockchain tokens integrated with

Wanchain, and issuers can more easily
manage their funds. Furthermore, when a
new blockchain is launched, the conversion
between the crowdfunded shares and the
native currency can be completed via the
Wanchain cross-chain transactions. With

Wanchain, we are entering an era of digital

right issuance fully based on blockchain.

5.5/ Other Applications

The financial applications described above
are intended to give readers a better under-
standing of the logic and value of Wanchain.
From these, we can come up with more
examples such as: multi-currency credit
cards based on digital currency, asset backed
securities that package up a variety of assets,
Peer-to-Peer lending businesses based on

digital currencies, crowdfunding, and so on.

Application of blockchain technology is
regarded as an important strategy by major
banks, but they are investigating the technol-
ogy to transform traditional business.

WANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD | 25

n the field of digital currency, banking busi-
ness, like currency exchange, has been boom-
ing. Blockchains progress in these fields on
wo parallel tracks, but with the rise of digital
assets and their increasing integration into
he real economy, these two tracks will even-

ually intersect. Digital assets will be included
in the banks' balance sheets (banks that
support the loan and deposit of digital assets)
and the banks’ balance sheets will be partially
transferred to blockchains (fiat money is
represented and accounted by blockchain
tokens). Wanchain’s inter-ledger technolo-
gies will support this future integration.
WANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD I 26

Conclusion

In this paper, we put forth the concept of a
future “bank”. The term “bank” is an analogy
used to give readers a more intuitive under-
standing of the concept. Abstracting block-
chain technology, from the concept of Bitcoin
into a neutral technology, greatly improved
the global popularization and application of
blockchain, however it still faces huge obsta-
cles. It’s risky and expensive for traditional
banks to solve existing business problems by
using blockchains. Decision makers are
unlikely and unwilling to take such a big risk
due to investor return expectations, and for
just one bank to change is not enough.

The financial framework based on digital
currency is like traditional banking at the busi-
ness level but is differentin its nature and orga-

nization. This is similar to what occured at the
inception of ecommerce, which did not sprout
from traditional industries, but generated new
commercial modalities that changed

the traditional industries. As the proportion of
digital currency in the economy increases,
new financial industries based digital currency
will flourish. Of course, given time, traditional
banks will join the digital currency economy in
their own ways and a financial ecosystem inte-

grating traditional assets with digital assets
will gradually be developed.

Wanchain aims to design a new decentralized

financial infrastructure, that allows the
exchange of value among different blockchain
networks. Based on this new model, interme-
diaries will develop their own financial
services and build a distributed super finan-
cial market via Wanchain. We believe that a
flexible, decentralized, value exchange system
is the future of the financial infrastructure, and
will help to promote financial inclusion and

standardize future financial transactions.

Appendix: Glossary of Terms

Chain ID: The chain identifier in Wanchain’ s registry. OriChainID is used to mark the original chain
in transactions.

Cross-Chain Transaction: An asset transfer between two different blockchains (which means
transfer-in or -out of the original chain.) When an asset on one chain is transferred to another
chain, the total amount of the assets in the two ledgers stays unchanged, which will not cause any
inflation or deflation.

Homogeneous Chain: Either a public or private chain developed based on Wanchain, which
contains the same cross-chain protocol and asset cross-chain mapping methods, and can be inte-
grated with Wanchain seamlessly for two-way asset transfers.

Inclusive Finance: Providing affordable financial services to disadvantaged and low-income
segments of society.

ICO(Initial Coin Offering): An initial coin offering (ICO) is a means of crowdfunding the release of a new
cryptocurrency. Generally, tokens for the new cryptocurrency are sold to raise money for technical
development before the cryptocurrency is released. Unlike an initial public offering (IPO), acquisition of
the tokens does not grant ownership in the company developing the new cryptocurrency.

Locked Account: The account to lock the assets transferred out of the chain.

Mapping Token (MT): The tokens on Wanchain corresponding to the original assets.

OriAccount: The account for the original chain that initiated the cross-chain transactions. For
example, the OriAccount of Alice is written as OriAccount(Alice).

Private Chain: A blockchain network with limited openness and decentralization compared with a
public chain, where authorization under specific rules is required for a new node to join the network.

Public Chain: A blockchain network fully open and decentralized, where any participants can join
the network if they follow the protocol of the public chain.
WANCHAIN WHITEPAPER >> WANCHAIN FOUNDATION LTD | 29

Storeman: A Wanchain node that holds the key shares of locked accounts, uses the key shares to
generate signature shares and combine them into complete signatures, and carries out other oper-
ations on locked accounts.

Token Locked Flag (TLF): During the process of asset locking, Wanchain nodes verify the transac-
ion OriTx on the original chain and broadcasts the TLF consensus results to other nodes.

Token Unlocked Flag (TUF): During the process of asset unlocking, Wanchain nodes verify the
ransaction OriTx on the original chain and broadcasts the TUF consensus results to other nodes.

Validator: The blockchain node used in packaging and verifying the transactions. Wanchain’ s verifica-
ion nodes are divided into three categories: the general verification nodes (Validators), the cross-chain

ransaction proof nodes (Vouchers), and the locked account management nodes (Storemen).

Voucher: A Wanchain verification node that is responsible for verifying whether the assets on the
original chain are locked or unlocked for cross-chain transactions.

WAN Account: An account maintained by Wanchain’ s Validators to initiate transactions on Wan-
chain and deploy or call smart contracts.

Wanchain: A public blockchain referred to in this white paper, including distributed ledger, smart
contract, cross-chain protocol and other contents, which can achieve the cross-chain transactions,
privacy protection for token transactions and other functions.

Wanchain Cross-Chain Protocol: The communication specifications for Wanchain cross-chain
transactions (WIP for short), which includes Wanchain Cross-Chain Transaction Requests (WITx-
Req), Token Locked Flag (TLF), Token Unlocked Flag (TUF) and Mapping Token (MT):

Wanchain Cross-Chain Transaction Request (WITxReq): A package of information, which
includes two parts - the Cross-Chain Transaction Request (Inter!xReq) and the Origin Chain Trans-
action (OriTx). If the original chain is “BTC”, then it will be written as OriTx(BTC). If the original
chain is the Wanchain, then it will be written as OriTx(WAN). For the public chain, OriTx is struc-

tured as the public chain transaction data format, and the wallet uses OriTx to initiate the asset
transfer to Wanchain’ s locked account on the original chain. Wanchain and the homogeneous

chain can construct a transaction UnlockedOriTx in accordance with the original chain transaction

data format. An OriTx is used to lock the original chain assets. An UnlockedOriTx is used to unlock
the original chain assets.

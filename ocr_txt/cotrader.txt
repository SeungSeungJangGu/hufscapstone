Executive Summary

WHY, WHAT, HOW: CoTrader’s goal is to provide users with financial freedom by optimizing
investments in minimal time for everyone, with the world’s first live social investment fund
marketplace on the blockchain.

To offer on-chain fund managers the best investment options, CoTrader pulls together
collaborative Decentralized Finance (DeFi) dapp such as Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs like
Kybre, Bancor, and Uniswap), DEX aggregators like Totle, on-chain lending and borrowing DAI
(eg Compound, MakerDAO), tokenized assets (synthetix) and more. We have already
integrated Kyber and will be integrating Compound and others Q3 2019.

OVERVIEW: CoTrader solves the complexity problem of investment management. It aims to
become the world’s open protocol for investment funds marketplaces by democratizing the $85
trillion global funds industry. For the first time in history, investors, now powered by CoTrader’s
blockchain platform, can have their investments managed with complete transparency, control of
assets, and proof of a fund’s past returns-on-investments (ROI). CoTrader’s MVP already
supports cryptos, and is live on the Ethereum mainnet at mainnet.cotrader.com.

PROBLEM: Investing in cryptos and DeFi can be very complicated and time consuming. Most
people lack the time and resources to do it properly, and instead may even lose money in bull
markets on bad projects with emotional or hasty trading. Investors are overwhelmed by the
1000s of cryptos and new growing projects. Even spending 24 hours per day wouldn't be
enough time for seasoned investors with deep technical, investing and other skills to properly
assess the entire crypto market.

SOLUTION: SMART FUNDS: CoTrader solves the complexity problems of investing by finding
the best performing fund managers to follow, with “Smart Funds”. These are blockchain smart
contracts powered investment funds that provides proof of past ROI performance, and
assurance that investors can always withdraw assets from any fund at any time. Anyone can
join or create Smart Funds with the click of a button, and are geared for supporting the long tail
of investment funds.

INCENTIVES: Smart Funds fund managers trade fund assets on the blockchain. Successful
fund managers receive a percentage of the profits they have made for their investors. Investors
remain in control of their money and are able to deposit and withdraw from any fund at any time.
Since investments and trades are done on-chain, smart contracts ensure each user that only
they can pull out their funds and that fund managers can only take an agreed upon performance
fee from the earnings.

NETWORK EFFECTS: Both influencers and high performance fund managers are incentivized
to do their best for their CoTraders (platform users who invest in fund managers), because top
fund managers can multiply their gains enormously. For example, a top fund manager managing
1000 times her own money, and charging a 10% performance fee from what she earns her
cotrader, would multiply her own gains by 100x (10% of 1000x). If the same fund manager
would earn 2x in a good month on their own, with CoTrader, she would earn 200x (100x times
the 2x she would have made). CoTraders will likely only use the best fund managers per sector.

Fund managers will be able to trade using CoTrader’s Super-DEX hybrid infrastructure, which
pools together both centralized exchanges and multiple DEXs including Bancor, Kyber, Ox,
CoTrader’s own DEX, and other future DEXs for maximum liquidity and power. Other platforms
can utilize and extend CoTrader’s infrastructure.

Contests are an additional engaging way to onboard users, with token prizes. An MVP to check
user engagement is at contests.cotrader.com. We are now working with partners to turn such
crowd wisdom into investable funds, even via FIAT. The main focus however, is to move
contests on-chain at our smart funds here mainnet.cotrader.com which will automatically award
tokens to winners. This functions as a user onboarding and growth strategy.

TOKEN ECONOMICS: Tokens can be staked on smart contract for guaranteed COT bonuses,
depending on locking period. To keep this available, the platform revenues are automatically

CoTrader © White paper Version 1.111.0.0
Copyright CoTrader © 2017-2018 - All Rights Reserved - page 2 of 27
used to buy back COT tokens to place back into the staking contract reserves. Tokens may be
used to automatically stake 5-10% of each fund’s value to redirect and earn platform fees.

ROADMAP FEATURES

All Assets

The CoTrader protocol can support all tradable assets, starting with cryptos, in major centralized
exchanges, from Binance to Ameritrade, with a safe decentralized access point, i.e., a smart
escrow exchange point. The smart escrow would only release funds to a broker on centralized
exchanges after the broker sends the cryptos to the buyer. This smart escrow can also be used
to support any tradable non-tokenized asset such as stocks, options, and other derivatives. In
effect, CoTrader can tokenize entire exchanges in this way.

In the future as more assets are tokenized by other crypto projects, these tokenized assets
could be tradable on CoTrader. This includes tokenized stocks, financial instruments, real-estate
and more.

Some projects are already tokenizing other cryptos like Bitcoin on, for example, Ethereum.
Unlike off-chain assets such as dollars in Tether, it’s easier to prove that the correct number of
Bitcoins are bought and sold each and every Ethereum trade. Meanwhile, cross-blockchain
atomic swaps technology, developed by other projects, is another avenue for broad asset
support.

IDOs

CoTrader is set to be the world’s first “IDO futures” marketplace, that doesn’t require trust in
lOUs, driven by smart-contracts. Fund managers will be empowered to enter IDOs as part of
their portfolios to take advantage of early group-buy discounts that many IDOs offer. This is
possible because CoTrader Smart Funds that are, by smart-contract, to receive future unlocked
IDO tokens are themselves tradable. CoTrader’s own DEX supports trading these Smart Fund
shares since each fund has its own tradable tokens. This means that if a fund manager takes
investors into an IDO position and some investors want to liquidate their shares that include the
future IDO tokens, they can trade away their token shares within the fund.

Privacy

CoTrader’s patent-pending privacy preserving smart funds algorithms can hide trades and fund
managers’ trading strategies while still publicly proving the returns of their anonymous funds on
the blockchain. CoTrader’s protocol is agnostic about the underlying mechanism used such as
various zero-knowledge-proofs (ZKP) as long as these support privacy-preserving
smart-contracts.

OPPORTUNITY: CoTrader can become the world’s largest investment funds and trading
marketplace. CoTrader token voters can set and adjust platform fees to gain e.g. 20% from fund
managers earnings, and small fees such as 0.1% per trade for some services. To get some idea

CoTrader © White paper Version 1.111.0.0
Copyright CoTrader © 2017-2018 - All Rights Reserved - page 3 of 27
of the market size for relevant industries, consider that global fund management is an $85 trillion
industry, and, by some estimates, total global asset trading amount to more than a quadrillion
dollars per year. Crypto trading alone amounts to over $10 billion dollars per day. These
industries are growing rapidly.

MISSION: Through the CoTrader platform we are democratizing funds and reinventing how they
can be used for a digital world. Our goal is to help people maximize returns in minimal time and
realize greater financial freedom together. We do this through connecting investors from both
sides of the expertise spectrum and providing them tools to quickly and easily make powerful
financial decisions to better their lives.

said, any changes are meant to improve the project and/or prices for buyers. All figures are

Contests

Before delving into the core of the CoTrader blockchain platform, which center around our Smart
Funds, we make a brief mention of our new contests. CoTrader Contests are a gamified way to
onboard new users, with token prizes at contests.cotrader.com. CoTrader is working with
potential partners (TBD) to turns this crowd wisdom into investable funds, even coming from
FIAT.

The main focus however, is to move contests on-chain to use our Smart Funds, live on
Ethereum at mainnet.cotrader.com.

Smart Funds

Smart funds are live on mainnet.cotrader.com, and make up the core of the CoTrader platform.
Asmart fund is an Ethereum smart contract that has a fund manager, investors, and shares that
can be traded. Each investor that invests in the fund is awarded a certain number of shares
representing his total ownership of the fund. The fund manager is able to trade the assets
invested into the fund with the aim of making himself and his investors a profit. The fund
manager receives a performance fee for any profits he makes his investors.

Investors remain in control of their investments and have the ability to deposit and withdraw
their money at will.

Smart funds implement the ERC20 token interface which means smart fund shares can be
traded on exchanges in the same way as any other ERC20 token.

One can invest in a smart fund by depositing CoTrader (COT) token into the fund.

Token Usage

Tokens can be staked on smart contract for guaranteed COT bonuses, depending on locking
period. To keep this available, the platform revenues are automatically used to buy back COT
tokens to place back into the staking contract reserves. Tokens may be used to automatically
stake 5-10% of each fund’s value to redirect and earn platform fees.

CoTrader © White paper Version 1.111.0.0
Copyright CoTrader © 2017-2018 - All Rights Reserved - page 6 of 27
Fund Creation

Anyone can create a smart fund on the CoTrader platform and deposit tokens into the fund. The
creator can choose a name for the fund as well as set his performance fee which is the
percentage of profits he will earn, typically around 20%.

Performance Fees

Instead of paying performance fees from CoTraders, performance fees will be paid from the
protocol’s emission revenue in the selling of new tokens in the DAIDO3 model explained below.

Investing

Each smart fund consists of shares representing the percentage ownership of each member of
the fund. When an investor invests in a smart fund, new shares are minted to represent his
holding of the fund based on the total amount he invested and the current value of the fund’s
holdings.

When an investor withdraws from the fund, shares are burnt accordingly decreasing the total
number of shares.

Mathematically, upon joining a fund with a total of Scurrent shares and a value of Vcurrent COT
(CoTrader Token), a user that deposits Vdeposit COT into the fund will be awarded Sdeposit
shares:

Sdeposit / Scurrent = Udeposit / Veurrent
Sdeposit = Udeposit * Scurrent/Ucurrent

For example, if an investor deposits 100 COT into a fund that has a value of 900 COT anda
total of 1800 shares. The new investor will receive the following number of shares:

100 « 1800/900 = 200 shares

The new fund value is now 900 + 100 = 1000 COT and the fund now has a total of
1800 + 200 = 2000 shares. So the new investor owns 200/2000 = 10% of the fund and the old

investors own 1800/2000 = 90% of the fund. The value of the new investor’s shares is
10% « 1000 = 100 COT and the value of the original investors’ shares is
90% *« 1000 = 900 COT, as expected.

CoTrader © White paper Version 1.111.0.0
Copyright CoTrader © 2017-2018 - All Rights Reserved - page 7 of 27
When an investor withdraws from a fund, he receives his portion of the fund minus the
performance fee for any profit the fund manager has made for him. His shares are destroyed,
decreasing the total number of shares in the fund.

For example, if an investor that owns 200 shares of a total of 2000 shares in the fund, and the
fund has a value of 1000 COT, then 1000 « 200/2000 = 100 COT worth of tokens will be
withdrawn from the fund and sent to the investor’s address (minus the fund manager
performance fee which will be discussed further below). The investors shares will be burnt so
the new fund will have a new total of 1800 shares.

Since Smart Funds are also ERC20 tokens they can be transferred between accounts like any
other cryptos. When shares are transferred in this way, no new shares are issued, nor are any
burnt.

Fund Managers

Anyone is able to become a fund manager using the CoTrader registry smart contract. The only
fee to do so is a minimal one time gas fee for the transaction (paid to the Ethereum miners).

For example, if a fund makes a profit of 2000 COT for his investors and has set a 20%
performance fee, the performance fee will be 2000 * 20% = 400 COT. Of this 20% fee, 16% will
go to the fund manager and 4% to the CoTrader platform. So the fund manager will earn 320
COT and CoTrader will receive 80 COT.

A fund manager typically starts trading with his own funds to build up ROI history. It may also
please investors to see that he has even more skin in the game, beyond any valuable reputation
and ROI history his fund may have built up over a long period of time.

CoTrader SuperDEX Infrastructure

Fund managers can trade assets on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). CoTrader provides a
SuperDEX infrastructure that pools other DEXs together for maximum the liquidity and power.
The initial integrations into the CoTrader platform will use Bancor', Kyber? and 0x? exchanges.
Further DEXs will be added over time as well as a native CoTrader DEX.

This will be done on the fund manager dashboard which will also provide tooling and charts to
make the best decisions for the fund.

Tokenized Assets

Initially fund managers will only be able to trade Ethereum and ERC20 tokens on the platform.
In the future as more assets are tokenized, fund managers will also be able to include these
assets in their portfolios. This will include other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin as well as other
assets such as the US dollar, gold, oil, S&P 500 stocks and even tokenized real-estate and
novel asset classes. Many of these items will rely on other projects successfully tokenizing real
world assets, creating trusted and liquid tokens for these assets on the blockchain.

Calculating Fund Values

Investors will deposit into funds using the CoTrader token (COT). To calculate the number of
shares the new investor will receive we need to know the value of the Smart Fund at the time of
the investment. This is trivial when the fund only contains COT in it, but becomes more complex
when the fund is holding multiple different tokens which will usually be the case.

Our initial integrations with decentralized exchanges are with Bancor and Kyber and both offer
the ability to request the price of a token on chain. Connecting to the Bancor and Kyber smart
contracts, the Smart Fund can automatically calculate its value at the time of deposit.

Protecting Smart Fund Investors

One of the fundamental selling points of blockchain technology is its decentralized, peer-to-peer
doesn’t require trust. Users are able to transfer crypto assets to a friend without a middleman or
having to trust anyone along the way.

Using decentralized exchanges provides a significant security advantage in that users aren’t
required to entrust their funds with a third party exchange that may be dishonest or susceptible
to hacking.

CoTrader Smart Funds offer the same advantages as cryptocurrencies and decentralized
exchanges, putting users in full control of their assets. Users have the ability to withdraw their
portions of a smart fund at any time with no one else having the ability to do so.

CoTrader fund managers can only trade on decentralized exchanges where the same prices are
available to everyone and is unable to make a direct trade with a personal address. The
decentralized exchanges currently integrated into the CoTrader platform are Bancor and Kyber
that fulfil the above criteria and the CoTrader team will carefully integrate decentralized
exchanges in the future to ensure full security for our users.

CoTrader © White paper Version 1.111.0.0
Copyright CoTrader © 2017-2018 - All Rights Reserved - page 9 of 27
Fund managers are also financially incentivized to perform well for their investors. A fund with a
positive ROI will attract many investors to invest and earn the fund manager a big profit if he
continues to trade profitably. It is in the fund manager’s best interest for the fund to continue
performing well.

A fund manager will also have the option to verify their account thereby also putting their
reputation on the line.

As we integrate new decentralized exchanges into the platform, care will be taken to make sure
that only trusted exchanges will be added as trading options. CoTrader may also make use of
oracles that hold a list of token prices to make sure no dishonest trades are happening. As we
add more exchanges to the platform, an investor will always be given a 30 day period to
withdraw his money from smart funds before the fund manager can make any trades with this
newly added exchange. The investor may choose to do this if unhappy with a newly added
exchange. The 30 day grace period will be built into the smart fund contract code so an investor
is able to see the exact terms of any investment he makes.

IDO Funds

IDOs are Initial DEX Offerings, similar to IEOs, but offered on DEXs. An IDO fund is a special
type of fund that may only contain IDO tokens. Investors that pool their funds together can
receive group discounts for IDOs and the purpose of an IDO fund is to do exactly that. IDOs
offer tremendous upside with investors sometimes seeing 100x+ returns in a short period of
time, but come with commensurate risk. Receiving a large discount as a pool investor heavily
increases your potential for a large profit.

IDO funds have a single period to buy in to the fund after which no new shares will be issued.
Only once the fund has received its tokens and from the IDO and these tokens have been
unlocked, can investors withdraw from the fund.

The added benefit of IDO funds is that since a fund is also an ERC20 token, fund share tokens
can be traded even before the IDO has finished, or before the tokens have been unlocked. This
creates liquidity for unavailable or locked tokens. We call this IDO and presale futures trading.

Since CoTrader smart funds mint their own shares tokens, even IDO tokens that have not yet
been sent from the IDO to the smart fund (or have been sent, but are still locked) can be
effectively traded via the shares’ tokens. This may be the world’s first platform to enable trading
future IDO tokens via smart contracts.

Investors can pre-whitelist their accounts so they need not be KYC’d for each new IDO
investment the fund manager makes.

CoTrader © White paper Version 1.111.0.0

Smart Shares DEX

As more features are added to Smart Funds and this financial tool becomes more complex and
capable of a wider range of use cases, some funds may be more difficult to invest in than
others. This can be due to the nature of IDO funds, minimum deposits, deposit cap, etc. When
these types of features are introduced it may not be possible for some investors to directly
deposit into specific funds. To solve this problem we will be introducing a smart shares DEX.
Any smart share can be traded on this DEX against COT. This DEX will be built into CoTrader’s
Smart Fund platform, giving users insights into all available data for the funds they are
interested in purchasing shares in.

Cryptographic Trader Privacy

Last but not least, the CoTrader platform will provide trade secrecy for fund managers. Fund
managers can hide their strategies, at least in the short term, and choose to display them later.
If their strategies were public at all times, they may have trouble commanding significant
success-fees for public information. Any top traders on other platforms not offering hidden trade
strategies would be incentivized to move to CoTrader where they can multiply their ROI.

Privacy Preserving Smart Contracts Protocol

CoTrader is agnostic about the underlying privacy-preserving smart contract mechanisms such
as zero-knowledge-proofs (ZKP). The public ROI calculation can be done and proven to be
correct without exposing the private inputs to the calculation function - namely, the secret trades.
More about this sensitive IP will be released in various yellow-paper addendums and code
releases at a later stage.

CoTrader Smart Escrow Exchanges

This provides the liquidity and variety of any centralized exchange with the safety and
transparency of decentralized exchanges. Traders will deposit funds for trading into a
smart-escrow. While the money is held by this smart contract, traders will be able to make
instant trades on any supported centralized exchange, from Binance to Ameritrade. When the
smart-escrow’s oracle detects that the purchased assets have been sent to the user, it releases
the escrow funds to the party doing the buy for them, which we might call the asset owner.

To prevent abuse or “race conditions” where for example the trader withdraws while the owner is
sending the assets from the exchange, there would be a series of locks. The owner would lock
the smart escrow funds from being withdrawn while sending pulling them off of the exchange, to
the smart escrow, where it'd then get forwarded to the trader. An oracle would read an open

CoTrader © White paper Version 1.111.0.0
Copyright CoTrader © 2017-2018 - All Rights Reserved - page 11 of 27
exchange read API and/or the blockchain and detect that this transfer is in progress, and would
disallow the trader from withdrawing the funds. The trader can request to further trade to other
assets on the exchange, before requesting to withdraw any assets. In the case that both the
trader and owner submit to the same block, the default can be that trader’s operation is acted
upon.

Tokenize All Assets on Any Exchange

As mentioned, when assets such as real estate, cars, stocks, etc, become tokenized, of course
any DEX can treat the tokens like any crypto. CoTrader, however, can even support non
tokenized assets. By using the smart-escrow exchange method in the section above, CoTrader
can support non crypto assets just the same. That is, a master account can hold stocks,
options, or any representation of tradable items, while an onchain smart escrow smart contract
can record investors operations and owed assets. In this way, CoTrader can offer a large
measure of security and proof of performance in this space.

Tokenization typically involves a broken buying and selling an individual underlying asset.
CoTrader’s Master Account and Smart Escrow mechanism does this for all tradable assets
available on any trading platform, and therefore achieves automatic tokenization for entire
exchanges - entire classes of assets - such as the stock and derivatives market enbulk.

Trading Tools Marketplace

Traders often search for convenient technical tools to research and be alerted of changes
across many exchanges and markets. CoTrader will provide a platform and marketplace to
develop, buy and sell such tools. Paying for these tools in COT will reduce platform fees.

At first the CoTrader team will provide basic tools. In the future, an open marketplace will be
developed to support 3rd party trading tool plugins and APIs that can interface with the
CoTrader platform. Some planned tools include trade triggers from simple price points to alerts
for combinations of more sophisticated indicators such as MACD divergence, Fibonacci
retracement, candlestick patterns, Bollinger Bands, advanced signal tools, and beyond.

Product is Live in Beta

The CoTrader beta is live on mainnet at https://mainnet.cotrader.com and an older version is on
the Ropsten testnet at testnet.cotrader.com. The platform allows users to create smart funds
and invest in them using Ropsten test ether. The CoTrader team continues to make
improvements on the product for its production launch planned for August 2018. The smart
contracts will undergo heavy auditing before then as well as fixing any known bugs.

Competition

There are existing platforms that offer copy trading and fund management in a centralized
manner. CoTrader’s decentralized version isn’t a competitor, but, rather, addresses a different
set of users, markets, assets, and regulatory environments. Centralized systems can have
upsides, but here are some of the limitations:

1. Regulations dictate who is allowed to use the system (must be rich and licensed)
2. DeFi dapp integration isn’t possible without oracles

3. Users are not in direct control of their money

4. There’s no proof of performance or total actual fees

eToro is a great and profitable company with millions users that pioneered copy trading. It was
originally a place to copy trade stock investors and has done very well expanding to include
cryptocurrencies. In March 2018, eToro closed a funding round of $100 million which shows the
vast opportunities available in the social copy trading and fund management space at large.

Covesting and other typical centralized copy trading platforms would require users to keep all of
their copy trading funds, and API keys, with them or with multiple centralized exchanges, and
keep (all) these funds there forever, as long as users wish to continue copy trading’. This is
dangerous because centralized exchanges themselves aren't safe, especially for the long term.

All these centralized platforms also do not offer proof on the public verifiable blockchain, nor the
fund managers’ ROI performance.

MelonPort is a decentralized project that aims to offer smart fund management on the
blockchain. Development for this project has stalled and there has only been integration with
one low volume decentralized exchange to date® and was not live on the mainnet when
CoTrader went live.

Iconomi offers index funds for crypto assets. These funds are not actively managed and the
platform has a high degree of centralization®.

Coinbase is also announcing its own index fund that will only contain the four currencies that
can be currently traded on their platform: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin.

Other shortcomings and questions are represented in the table below.

CoTrader stands out from the competition as being the only fully decentralized fund

Another major advantage of CoTrader smart funds is that they enable investors to co-trade
rather than copy trade. The fundamental difference is that when copy trading the copiers always
lag behind the lead trader, always receiving a worse price than the copied trader. When
co-trading, all tokens are traded by a single entity giving the same price to all shareholders of
the smart fund. CoTrader smart funds also enable IDO funds trading without requiring trust.

CoTrader Business Model & Charts

CoTrader aims to become the world’s largest investment funds and trading marketplace without

custodianship, neither on the part of the CoTrader platform, nor traders (fund managers).

CoTrader typically earns 4% of investment gains, or 20% from every 20% of traders’ typical
performance fee (20%), and small fees such as 0.1% per trades on the CoTrader DEX and

Smart Escrow Exchange for all assets. Tokens are bought back with profits. Tokens are needed
to hide trading strategies. The current MVP deals only with this first category of Crypto Fund
Management. CoTrader plans to enter the other markets (global funds management, and equity

and derivatives trading) as seen further below.

The total revenue that we are projecting for the coming four years are represented cumulatively

In order to reach these revenue numbers, we are also planning to spend significant resources
on marketing and acquiring cotraders and traders. Our acquisition projections are based on an
average spend of $75 per cotrader and $500 per trader. Potential trader talent could be lured to
try their skill at trading for special rewards such as contests and specials.

We expect to have large user growth. Our primary focus is on targeting good traders, who will
help encourage more people to become cotraders. Each trader is intrinsically encouraged to
add cotraders to their fund because the more money that is in their fund means more money for
the traders to make through successful trades.

The growth of traders and cotraders can be seen in the following graph where cotrader growth
is in red and trader growth underneath in blue:

The Total revenue is a combination of our five investment options: Crypto Fund Management,
Crypto Trading, Global Fund Management, Global Equity Trading, and Global Derivatives
Trading. These investment options use CoTrader’s unique Smart Funds and Smart Escrow
offerings. Smart Funds allow traders to trade cotraders’ funds on a decentralized exchange.
Smart Escrow gives traders the advantages that come with a centralized exchange such as
liquidity and variety with the safety and transparency of a decentralized exchange.

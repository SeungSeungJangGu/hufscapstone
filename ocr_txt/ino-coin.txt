10. Ino Platform as the core ofour project
Inthis white paper we present InoCoin, abrand new technology for securely
transferring money between anonymous peers. Our solution is based on the
Ethereum Codebase and keys/addresses system including multisignature
outputs and ring signatures.

The main purpose of this technology is to help young entrepreneurs and
startups to secure financing and develop their idea. At the same time, the
technology enables anyone to become an investor and earn a return on their
investment.
1. Abstract

Unlike other projects, InoCoin is a universal payment tool, but aside from
serving as a platform for procuring venture capital, it also provides an
opportunity for any person to take advantage of the innovations and benefits

that new projectsoffer.

InoCoinisa global platform for funding and provision of knowhow to new
Blockchain projects. Asacurrency, itis backed by ateam of people with great
technical and commercial skills, people who willshare advice and showright
direction to young teams in addition to providing funds. It is a unique
decentralized system forjoint decision making between the lead team, project
representatives and all investors as well as owners of the currency. It enables
sharing of knowledge, ideas and wealth through InoCoin.
2. Blockchain technology

Before the blockchain era, commerce required building trust between the
transacting parties, which in practice meant proving that each party was
actually capable of fulfilling their obligations in accordance with the terms
agreed beforehand. Failing to stick to one’s promises would wreak havoc in the
markets.

As aconsequence, there was aneed fora third party, a financial intermediary,
that would take the risks of the counterparty default unto itself. Whether due
to practical reasons following from market necessity or because ofimposed
regulations by government agencies, middlemen became an integral part of
the market landscape to ensure every party kept up their end of the bargain.

The blockchain technology removes the need for a middleman as the validity of
a transaction is confirmed by the network of independent nodes. A
decentralized, distributed one-way ledger existing in thousands of copies
across the world removes the overhead introduced by third parties, with a
bonus of greatly diminishing the time it takes to confirm a transaction.

Blockchain has marked the beginning of a truly new era. Now, the blockchain
technology makes old payment systems redundant and outdated. With
blockchain, there is no more need for complex auditing systems as it has its
own audit system built in, which provides reliable accountability right out of
the box. Transactions which get written to the blockchain are literally set in
stone and time. Once a transaction gets confirmed, there is no way back as all
transactions are intentionally made irreversible. No one can change them.

This becomes possible through a consensus mechanism. The two major ways
to reach a consensus in the blockchain network are Proof of Work and Proof of
Stake. Their effect is that they render the efforts to compromise a blockchain
prohibitively expensive even for those who can spend billions of dollars, for
example, government agencies, and yet more costly for major decentralized
currencies like Bitcoin.

The security of the network is guaranteed by the distributed nature of
decentralized blockchains and cryptographic algorithms used. Moreover, the
costs of preventing new transactions from receiving confirmations are rising
exponentially as the network expands, so this attack vector will be even less
feasible in the future when the blockchain technology gains more traction in
the Internet.
Currencies based on decentralized blockchains don’t need a trusted third party
as is the case with a centralized payment system, for example, a Central bank.
This eliminates a single point of failure by making decentralized systems
immune and invulnerable to things like blackmail, bribes, corruption, virtually
everything which regularly overruns legacy systems.

As a result, decentralized blockchains are operating beyond the reach and
outside the control of financial structures and oligopolies which are more often
than not pursuing their own ends incompatible or even directly hostile and
antagonistic to the idea of an open market, which the blockchain technology
greatly contributes to.
3. Smart contracts

It is possible to implement a Turing-complete programming language within
the blockchain itself. A piece of computer code stored and replicated on the
blockchain system is called a smart contract. These contracts got a lot of
traction over the last few years. As Turing-complete, they can store, convert,
and process arbitrary data in a formally specified (algorithmic) manner,
depending on specific conditions set beforehand. And it is not only about
storing and processing information related to account balances, which is what
the Bitcoin blockchain mostly deals with, as any data including but definitely
not limited to data about data (metadata), sets of rules, restrictions,
transaction conditions can be entered into a smart contract, i.e. virtually
anything that can be processed by a modern desktop PC.

First smart contracts were implemented using the Bitcoin blockchain but due
to the limitations of the underlying protocol, it was not possible to execute
complex logic procedures inan efficient way ontop ofit. Thus, the most widely
used Turing-complete blockchain dubbed Ethereum was born which enables
execution of complex smart contracts mostly involving financial operations.
For example, a small smart contract consisting of just a few lines of code can
set rules about transferring assets or executing predefined operations once
certain conditions are met. These conditions can be triggered immediately or
at some point in the future.

Smart contracts allow to strike a bargain between two parties without running
the risk of default by either. The contract is either carried out fully or gets
cancelled completely, so no party is in fact risking anything. If one side fails to
deliver, the other retains what belongs to it. And all of this comes with the
benefits which a plain vanilla blockchain enjoys.
4. What problems InoCoin solves?
And How it Works?

Within the InoCoin platform, there are several main features that are of
interest to future users. The “like” button is the first such feature as it is
intended to allow the community to vote on what projects should get financial
support. This occurs every three months as our managerial team redirects
InoCoins in order to fund a project.

The second feature is the “boost” button which allows investors to fund
projects on an individual basis. There is no limit as to how much or how little
can be invested. Each project individually details the benefits the investors
receive. InoCoin provides every single person with a chance to be an investor or
innovator. Age, knowledge, wealth, etc. are not important.

Atthe same time, InoCoin provides an opportunity to every person witha great
idea even though they don’t have sufficient financial resources.

InoCoin makes the world a better place as it connects investors with innovators
thanks to its being an investment platform, enabling them to improve upon
new or existing technologies. And all this comes without any taxes. Everyone
with a good idea is welcome to share it, and we will do our best in raising the
money required to implement it.

Youcan register at https://platform.inocoin.eu and choose the role you want to
take, either as an investor or innovator, or both.

9. Roadmap

The idea of the project was worked out during Q4 of 2017. Since then we have
designed and developed the investment platform InoCoin. The InoCoin token is
not like any other, that’s why we are not following the common Initial Coin
Offering (ICO) route. We are aiming to be listed on the public markets and
provide everyone with a chance to be a part of this huge project.

By the end of 2018, at least one startup will be financed and developed with our
help and the help of our investors.

10. Ino Platform as the core of our project

Wewouldliketomakeaconclusion why the InoCoin investment platform is

superior to othermore conventional means ofinvesting. Our platform allows
investors ofall sizes to participate. This is the key factor that differentiates us
from the traditional systems which usually restrict investment opportunities
toasmall circle ofindividuals. We areremoving these high barriers for entry.

Using our platform anyone can invest regardless of whether it’s $1 or
$1,000,000. The platform is capable of calculating profit as a percentage of
investment automatically, depending on the size of the investment. Inocoin is
a utility token that will be the future of crowdfunding. After investing in INO,
you are able to receive smart services and all kinds of products from the
projects you support.

The InoCoin Investment Platform places no restrictions on startups. We
believe this is the key to a successful business in the new age. These new
ventures need to be innovative above all else, not constrained by the limits of
old ideas. Due to these requirements, the more interesting and fresh the idea
is, the more likely the project is to secure funding. If you believe you will
struggle to secure investment because your idea is too unproven or overly
optimistic, then you would be an ideal candidate to apply for funding through
InoCoin. Many of the great innovators of our time were thought to be too
forward thinking at first, struggling to secure the funding and trust necessary
to realize their ideas.

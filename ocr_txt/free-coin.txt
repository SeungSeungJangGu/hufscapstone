Support mass adoption of cryptocurrencies

2017 — General awareness

2017 was the year of the public breakthrough of cryptocurrencies. We saw

- Anexplosive increase of prices of the different cryptocurrencies
- An abundance of cryptocurrency projects being launched

As a result cryptocurrency became a hot news item, and even governments and central banks
started studying cryptocurrency as a disruptive transformation of the worldwide financial system.

By the end of 2017, more than 2500 different cryptocurrencies were officially listed at the different
Exchanges, and many more were being traded without official listing (EG via address trading on
decentralized exchanges).

However, the number of persons that participate actively in the cryptocurrency trade was still very
limited : less than 1 percent of the world population was actively investing in cryptocurrency

As from 2018 — Mass acceptance starts

Different studies indicate that as from 2018 there will be a start of the mass adoption of
cryptocurrencies. This acceptance of cryptocurrencies will vary in function of :

- Age: Bloomberg studies estimates that soon up to 33% of the Millennials will use
cryptocurrencies

- Location : Cryptocurrency usage is currently concentrated in specific geographical areas,
other areas are underrepresented

- Income : the popular cryptocurrencies have reached high price levels, bringing them out of
reach of the persons that are in a financial weak position

- Education : currently the trading of cryptocurrencies at exchanges seems complex, and this
is an obstruction for some people to start using crypto.

- Technology Access : About 60 % of the world population has access to a PC or Smartphone,
and can thus invest in cryptocurrencies.

As from 2018 we will see a massive inflow of capital to invest in cryptocurrencies :

- The number of persons that invest in cryptocurrency will be multiplied by 10. Especially
Millennials — with less trust in banks and economic stability — will look at alternative ways to
invest to safeguard their financial future, even after retirement

- Banks, Pension funds, Insurance Companies, ... are preparing to enter the cryptocurrency
market, and to invest a part of their financial holdings in cryptocurrencies

www.FREEcoin.technology FREEcoin@outlook.be page 5

WHITEPAPER : The FREE project, The FREE coin 24/11/2018

- Companies discovered cryptocurrencies as a successful way to raise capital, a good
alternative for shares and bonds

- Central Banks and Governments start studying the possibility to create their own
cryptocurrencies

The challenge for the FREE project

The demand for cryptocurrency will explode - billion(s) of persons will want to invest in
cryptocurrencies. And then banks and companies will also want to invest ...

However the current cryptocurrencies are not suited for mass adoption. Look at Bitcoin, Ether,
Litecoin, Bitcoin cash, Neo, Monero, Dash, ZCash, Qtum, Ven, Lisk, ... : the available supply of these
coins is expressed in millions, not in billions.

Suppose that a billion people are going to invest in Bitcoin or Litecoin or Bitcoin cash : the price will
increase so much that these coins will become useless as an “exchange of value”, because the
transactions would have to be executed at so many decimal points, that it would become
unreadable for humans: “A bread ? That is 0,00000012 Litecoin please”

To support the mass adoption, the FREE project will deliver :

- AFREE coin which :
o Has a supply which is high enough to be used by every person on earth
o Is launched at a price which is so low (and 50 % even free of cost during first 3
months) that also people with less financial means can own FREE coins.
- Active promotion and support to people worldwide to adopt cryptocurrency at the most
easy and lost low cost way.

We decided to deliver this solution using the Ethereum Blockchain :
- Wallets and Exchanges are widely available
- Proven technology, that is sufficient fast and reliable to be used for storage and exchange of
value
- Mining is guaranteed also in the future, due to the many altcoins that run on top of
Ethereum

Make cryptocurrency inclusive

Currently the crypto market is reserved for the wealthy that have enough knowledge to know how
to use wallets and exchanges.

The majority of the people is excluded, because crypto is too expensive for them, or because it looks
too complicated to work with Exchanges and Wallets, or because there is no active community in
their language to help them in their first steps.

To make sure that as much people as possible get access to the cryptocurrency market (and wealth
that is being generated on these markets), the FREE project will

- Launch a coin at extreme low price . The FREE coin will be distributed during the first 3
months :
o 50%via exchanges, at the price of only 0,0000000001 Ether (about 0,00000006
dollar, in April 2018)
o 50% free of cost via targeted donations, giveways and airdrops.
- Launch a coin which has sufficient supply, to survive the mass adoption without an
immediate price explosion
- Promote the initiative via “Brand Ambassadors” and social media worldwide
- Simplify the purchase of cryptocurrency to the maximum (EG for starters who are still
confused about how Exchanges work : offer the possibility to buy the FREE coin via a
classical webshop and pay via Paypal)

Create Global Wealth

Cryptocurrencies will become worldwide the standard “storage of value”, and will replace current
methods to store value (fiat money, bank accounts, pension funds, precious metals, derivates, ...).

Because of the laws of Supply and Demand, the value of cryptocurrencies will increase fast, for some
coins the value will really explode.

Lots of new wealth will be created during this process (and existing wealth will be transferred from
the old storage of value items to cryptocurrency).

People that will be early adopters of cryptocurrencies will profit from these price increase, and will
generate a lot of wealth.

The FREE project wants to allow everyone the possibility to become an “early adopter”, so that
everyone has the chance to participate in this wealth creation.

Price and Supply of the FREE coin.

To be able to act as a “store of value” and an “exchange of value” the FREE coin has to meet 2
requirements :

1) Enough coins have to be available, to allow everyone worldwide to use it
2) Enough coins have to be available, so that price is less volatile and can be use for exchange
of value

We decided to create 10.000 Billion FREE coins.
Is this not too much ?
No, this is only about 1.400 FREE coins per person on earth.

Furthermore there are today 80.900 Billion “dollar equivalent” stored in bank accounts and
banknotes/coins worldwide. And even a higher value is stored in “derivates” and precious metals.

So there is only 1 FREE coin for every 8 Dollar equivalent that exists today in banknotes/coins and
bank accounts. This means that the FREE coin cannot become the only worldwide cryptocurrency,
but can take a leading position between the few cryptocurrencies that will be adopted worldwide.

Let’s compare the number of FREE coin also with the value of EURO’s in the European Community :
500 million inhabitants use 1.300 Billion Euro in banknotes/coins and have at least 19.000 Billion
Euro’s in banks (these figures are related to the 10 largest banks only, so the real total of all banks
will be much higher). When 500 million inhabitants of the EC have more than 20.000 billion EURO in
banknotes and bank ccounts, than a total of 10.000 billion FREE coins for 7 Billion people worldwide
seems correct ?

The distribution of the FREE coin will be done in 2 phase :
PHASE 1: distribute 4.000 Billion FREE Coins during 2018

PHASE 2 : distribute gradually the remaining 6.000 Billion FREE coins in function of market needs.

Why will the FREE coin increase in value, it is not backed by gold ? The EURO is not backed by gold,
the Dollar is since 1971 no longer backed by gold, so why do they have “value” ? Because there is a
general TRUST in these currencies. When people trust that they can use something to exchange in a

trade, then this object develops value.

The Bitcoin developed a high value, because the first darknet users agreed it was useful as non-
traceble way to transfer value to pay for transactions. And once the value of the Bitcoin started to
increase, other people saw additional usage : high return investment, hiding value for Taxes,
transferring value worldwide ultrafast and at low cost, 100 % availability and uptime of the support
IT infrastructure, ...

What worked for the Bitcoin will also work for other cryptocurrencies : once it is widely spread and
once it is really traded at exchanges, people will see the value of the FREE for them : price of FREE
will start to increase, people will start accepting it in trade transactions, it is a safe storage of value
(even in unsafe physical environments), it has a correct supply taken into account the world
population, ...

Technical solution

Smart Contract

The FREE coin is created as an ERC20 smart contract on the Ethereum ETH blockchain.

The smart contract address can be consulted at :
https://etherscan.io/address/0x2f141ce366a2462f02cea3d12cf93e4dca49e4fd

The smart contract code can be consulted at :
https://etherscan.io/address/0x2f141ce366a2462f02cea3d12cf93e4dca49e4fd#code

The distribution of the FREE coins over the different coin holders, can be consulted at :
https://etherscan.io/token/0x2f141ce366a2462f02cea3d12cf93e4dca49e4fd#balances

Wallets

The FREE coin can be stored in every wallet which is Ethereum ETH ERC20 compatible :
Myetherwallet, Metamask, Mist, Ledger, ...

The parameters to perform the set-up of the FREE coin in the wallet are :

- contact address = 0x2f141ce366a2462f02cea3d12cf93e4dca49e4fd
- symbol = FREE
- number of decimal positions = 18

Exchanges

The FREE coin can be traded via address trading on every ether based Distributed Exchange (DEX) :
Token.store, Forkdelta, Etherdelta, ...

The project team will also negotiate to have the FREE coin listed at a major exchange. But the price
for such a listing is very high ...

When we prove together that many persons are adopting the FREE coin, the Exchanges will list the
FREE coin on their own initiative (because they can make money out of trading it)

WHITEPAPER : The FREE project, The FREE coin 24/11/2018

The Team

The FREE coin is started by a small team of unpaid volunteers. The number and composition of the
FREE coin Core Team evolves in function of the project phase, skills needed and workload to be
done.

We do not consider ourselves as the long term owner of the FREE coin, but simply as the persons
that are doing the start-up and that will guide the FREE coin to maturity.

Once ALL coins are distributed, the FREE coin will be a self-regulation eco-system, exact as what we
see with the Bitcoin.

Question : what happens with the financial earnings that result from the initial sale of the FREE coins
by the project team ? These earnings will be used to pay the listing of the FREE Coins on Exchanges,
to finance the give-away actions (gas usage coin distribution) and to promote the FREE coin
initiative.

Exchanges and Webshop

The FREE coin will be distributed via Exchanges and via a webshop.

The number of exchanges that offer the FREE coin will continue to increase. We advise you to check
our website www.FREEcoin.technology to have the latest list available

During the first month of the project, the FREE coins were distributed via FORKDELTA and
Token.store. Today the FREE coin is listed on many exchanges, for a full list please visit our website

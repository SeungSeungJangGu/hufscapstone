Introduction

A Balancer Pool is an automated market maker with certain key properties that cause it to function as

a self-balancing weighted portfolio and price sensor.

Balancer turns the concept of an index fund on its head: instead of paying fees to portfolio managers to

rebalance your portfolio, you collect fees from traders, who rebalance your portfolio by following

arbitrage opportunities.
Balancer is based ona particular N-dimensional surface which defines a cost function for the exchange
of any pair of tokens held in a Balancer Pool. This approach was first described by V. Buterin[0],
generalized by Alan Lu[1], and proven viable for market making by the popular Uniswap[2] dapp.

We independently arrived at the same surface definition by starting with the requirement that any
trade must maintain a constant proportion of value in each asset of the portfolio. We applied an
invariant-based modeling approach described by Zargham et al[3] to construct this solution. We will

prove that these constant-value market makers have this property.

Present Work

Index funds are a common financial instrument. The first index fund became effective in 1972. Ever
since, investors rely heavily on different portfolio strategies to hedge risk and achieve diversification.

Index funds guarantee investors a constant and controlled exposure to a portfolio. If one of its assets
out- or under-performs, it is respectively sold or bought to keep its value share of the total portfolio
constant.

Both in the conventional financial system as well as in the blockchain context, index funds and other
types of investment portfolios charge investors fees for managing and holding their funds. These fees
are necessary to pay for the costs of actively rebalancing the index funds, be it by manual traders or

automatic bots.

There are many centralized solutions for portfolio management and for investing in index funds. These

all share some form of custodial risk.

We are aware of one decentralized (read: non-custodial) solution that shares all the fundamental
characteristics Balancer was designed to have: Uniswap. This approach was first described by V.

Buterinand generalized by Alan Lu.

We independently arrived at the same surface definition by starting with the requirement that any
trade must maintain a constant proportion of value in each asset of the portfolio. We applied an
invariant-based modeling approach described by Zargham et al to construct this solution. We will

prove that these constant-value market makers have this property.

Theory

Throughout this paper, we use the term “token” to refer to a generic asset because our first
implementation is a contract system that manipulates ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum network.
However, there is nothing fundamental about the Ethereum execution context that enables this
market-making algorithm, which could be offered by a traditional financial institution as a centralized

(custodial) product.

Value Function

The bedrock of Balancer’s exchange functions is a surface defined by constraining a value function V —
a function of the pool’s weights and balances — to a constant. We will prove that this surface implies a
spot price at each point such that, no matter what exchanges are carried out, the share of value of each

token in the pool remains constant.

The value function V is defined as:

Vv =11B" (1)

t
Where

e tranges over the tokens in the pool;
e B,is the balance of the token in the pool;

e W, is the normalized weight of the token, such that the sum of all normalized weights is 1.
By making V constant we can define an invariant-value surface as illustrated in Fig.0.

Spot Price

Each pair of tokens in a pool has a spot price defined entirely by the weights and balances of just that
pair of tokens. The spot price between any two tokens, SpotPrice?, or in short SP.°, is the the ratio of

the token balances normalized by their weights:

Where:

e B; is the balance of token i, the token being sold by the trader which is going into the pool.

e B, is the balance of token o, the token being bought by the trader which is going out of the pool.
e W,; is the weight of token i

e W, is the weight of token o

From this definition it is easy to see that if weights are held constant, the spot prices offered by
Balancer Pools only change with changing token balances. If the pool owner does not add or remove
tokens to/from the pool, token balances can only change through trades. The constant surface causes
the price of tokens being bought by the trader (token o) to increase and price of tokens being sold by
the trader (token 1) to decrease. One can prove that whenever external market prices are different
from those offered by a Balancer Pool, an arbitrageur will make the most profit by trading with that
pool until its prices equal those on the external market. When this happens there is no more arbitrage
opportunity. These arbitrage opportunities guarantee that, in a rational market, prices offered by any

Balancer Pool move in lockstep with the rest of the market.

Effective Price

It is important to bear in mind that SP° is the spot price, which is the theoretical price for infinitesimal

trades, which would incur no slippage. In reality, the effective price for any trade depends on the
amount being traded, which always causes a price change. If we define A, as the amount of token o
being bought by the trader and A; as the amount of token i being sold by the trader, then we can define

the Effective Price as:

And as mentioned above, EP tends to SP when traded amounts tend to 0:

SP°= lim EP?
Ay Ai 0

Spot Price Proof

(2)

(3)

(4)
Let’s now prove that this choice of V entails Eq.2.

First of all, we know that what the trader buys, Ag, is subtracted from the contract’s balance.
Therefore A, = —AB,. Likewise, what the trader sells, A;, is added to the contract’s balance.

Therefore A; = AB;.

Substituting in Eq.2 and Eq.3 we get:

AB;
SP.°= lim EP°= im , (5)
Ay Ai 0 AB,.AB>0 —AB,
This limit is, by definition, minus the partial derivative of B; in function of B,:
OB;
SP,° = -—+ (6)

From the value function definition in Eq.1 we can isolate B;:

Now we use Eq.7 to expand the partial derivative in Eq.6:

which concludes our proof.
Constant Value Distribution Proof
We will now prove that:

1. Balancer Pools maintain a constant share of value across all tokens in the pool and;

2. These shares of value are equal to the weights associated to each token.

Let’s calculate V ', the total pool value in terms of an arbitrary token t from the pool. Since we already
know that the pool has B, tokens t, let’s calculate how many tokens t all the other remaining tokens are
worth. It does not make sense to use their Effective Price relative to token t since we are not going to
do any actual trade. Instead, to calculate the theoretical value we use their Spot Price relative to token
t.

From Eq.2 we can calculate V,,, ie how many tokens t the balance of each token n is worth:

B
B Ww W,
V,i= —* =B,- 2 =Be (8)
SP; a WwW,

We know that the total pool value in terms of tokens t is the sum of the values of each token in terms of

tokens t:

VISE Vi=BtE Vi=Bt2-E Wes 2 -W+E Wis 2 6)

k ket t ket t kat Wt

Now to calculate S,, the share of value each token n represents in the pool, all we have to do is divide
the value of each token n, V,, by the total pool value, V ':

vi
=r We (10)

Sn
which proves both that the share each token represents of the total pool value is constant and also that

it is equal to the weight of that token.

Trading Formulas

Calculating the trade outcomes for any given Balancer Pool is easy if we consider that the Value
Function must remain invariant, i.e. V must have the same value before and after any trade.
In reality, V will increase as a result of trading fees applied after a trade state transition.

For more details on fees, see Implementation: Swap and Exit Fees

Out-Given-In

When a user sends tokens i to get tokens 0, all other token balances remain the same. Therefore, if we
define Aj and Ag as the amount of tokens i and 0 exchanged, we can calculate the amount A, a users
gets when sending A;. Knowing the value function after the trade should be the same as before the

trade, we can write:
TI (Bx)™* «(Bo - Ao) ¥* - (Bi + Ai)™ = T1(Bx)™* (11)

k#i,0 k

TT (Bx)™* + (Bo = Ao) (Bi + Ai)! = TT (Bx) - Bo? BY (12)

In-Given-Out

It is also very useful for traders to know how much they need to send of the input token A; to get a

desired amount of output token Ay. We can calculate the amount Aj; as a function of Ag similarly as

follows:
TI (By)™* - (By - Ao)? «(Bi + Ai)™' = TI (Ba)™* (16)

A, = Bi Bo_)® - 1 (20)

Notice that A, as defined by Eq.11 tends to SP.° - Aj when Aj << Bj, as expected. This can be proved
by using LHopital’s rule, but this proof is out of the scope of this paper.

In-Given-Price

For practical purposes, traders intending to use our contract for arbitrage will like to know what
amount of tokens i - A; - they will have to send to the contract to change the current spot price SP.° to
another desired one SP,°. The desired spot price will usually be the external market price and, so long

as the contract spot price differs from that of the external market, any arbitrageur can profit by trading

with the contract and bringing the contract price closer to that of the external market.

The highest profit possible by an arbitrageur is when they bring the contract spot price exactly to that
of the external market. As already mentioned, this is the main reason why our design is successful in
keeping track of the market prices. This makes it a reliable on-chain price sensor when implemented on

a blockchain.

It can be proven that the amount of tokens i - A; - a user needs to trade against tokens o so that the

pool’s spot price changes from SP° to SP,° is:

( sP, \
Aj = Bj -|( ) -1| (21)

Liquidity Providing Formulas
Pool Tokens

Pools can aggregate the liquidity provided by several different users. In order for them to be able to
freely deposit and withdraw assets from the pool, Balancer Protocol has the concept of pool tokens.
Pool tokens represent ownership of the assets contained in the pool. The outstanding supply of pool
tokens is directly proportional to the Value Function of the pool. If a deposit of assets increases the

pool Value Function by 10%, then the outstanding supply of pool tokens also increases by 10%. This

happens because the depositor is issued 10% of new pool tokens in return for the deposit.

There are two ways in which one can deposit assets to the pool in return for pool tokens or redeem

pool tokens in return for pool assets:

e Weighted-asset deposit/withdrawal

e Single-asset deposit/withdrawal

All-Asset Deposit/Withdrawal
An “all-asset” deposit has to follow the distribution of existing assets in the pool. If the deposit contains
10% of each of the assets already in the pool, then the Value Function will increase by 10% and the
depositor will be minted 10% of the current outstanding pool token supply. So to receive Pissueq POO!
tokens given an existing total supply of Psuppiy, one needs to deposit D, tokens k for each of the tokens
in the pool:

Psupply + Pissued

Dy, = P

—1)-By (22)
supply

Where B, is the token balance of token k before the deposit.
Similarly, a weighted-asset withdrawal is the reverse operation where a pool token holder redeems
their pool tokens in return for a proportional share of each of the assets held by the pool. By

redeeming PyedeemeaPOOl tokens given an existing total supply of Psupply, one withdraws from the pool
an amount Ax of token k for each of the tokens in the pool:

Psupply — Predeemed
P

) By (23)
supply

Where B, is the token balance of token k before the withdrawal.

Single-Asset Deposit/Withdrawal

When a user wants to provide liquidity to a pool because they find its distribution of assets interesting,

they may likely not have all of the assets in the right proportions required for a weighted-asset deposit.

Balancer allows anyone to get pool tokens from a shared pool by depositing a single asset to it,
provided that the pool contains that asset.

Depositing a single asset A to a shared pool is equivalent to depositing all pool assets proportionally
and then selling more of asset A to get back all the other tokens deposited. This way a depositor would
end up spending only asset A, since the amounts of the other tokens deposited would be returned
through the trades.

The amount of pool tokens one gets for depositing a single asset to a shared pool can be derived from
the Value Function described above.
Single-Asset Deposit

The increase in the pool token supply proportional to the increase in the Value Function. If we define
Pissuedas the amount of pool tokens issued in return for the deposit, then:

,

Vv _ P supply _ Psupply + Pissued
Vv Psupply Psupply
V ,

Pissued = Psupply . ora -1) (24)
Where V | is the Value Function after the deposit and V is the Value Function before the deposit.
Considering also B, the balance of asset k after the deposit and B, its balance before the deposit, we
have:

v'_ 1,

Vi TI, (By) ¥*
Let’s say the single-asset deposit was done in asset t, then the balances of all other tokens do not
change after the deposit. We can then write:
' B Wi ')W, i We
vi 1,8)" — By” __B,
Vo TB) (BY Br

VY

If we define A, as the amount deposited in asset t, then the new pool balance of asset t is $$B’t = B_t+
A_t$$. We can then substitute and get the final formula for the amount of new pool tokens issued $P{issued}

inreturnforasinge — assetdepositl_t$:

A.
Pissued = Psupply “(d+ 3 -1) (25)

t

Single-Asset Withdrawal

When a pool token holder wants to redeem their pool tokens Predeemea in return for a single asset t, the

amount withdrawn in asset t, Ay, is:

as
A, =B,-(1—(1 — Pedeemed_y™' (26)
Psupply

Where B, is the pool balance of asset t before the withdrawal.

Indeed, using the formulas of deposit and withdrawal defined above, not considering any fees, if one
deposits A, asset t for Piscueq POO! tokens and then redeems that same amount of pool tokens for asset t

, they will get the same initial A; back.

Trading Fees for Single-Asset Deposit Withdrawal

Depositing or withdrawing to/from a shared pool ina single asset t is equivalent to trading (1 — W,) of
the amount deposited for all the other assets in the pool. W, of the amount deposited is held by the

pool already in the form of asset t, so charging a trading fee on that share would be unfair.

Indeed, if we disregard any possible pool exit fees, depositing only asset i and instantly withdrawing
asset owill incur in the same trading fees as doing the trade from i to 0 using the trade function the pool

offers.

Implementation
There are a few initial notes regarding the first release of Balancer. We will release a much more
detailed explanation of the system at the same time that the source code is released.

Free Software on Ethereum

Balancer is implemented as a GPL3-licensed Ethereum smart contract system.

Releases

The ¢ Bronze Release%@ is the first of 3 planned releases of the Balancer Protocol. Bronze

emphasizes code clarity for audit and verification, and does not go to great lengths to optimize for gas.

The. Silver Release~ will bring many gas optimizations and architecture changes that will reduce

transaction overhead and enable more flexibility for controlled pools.

The “6: Golden Release: will introduce several new features to tie the whole system together.

Numerical Algorithms

The formulas in the Theory section are sufficient to describe the functional specification, but they are
not straightforward to implement for the EVM, in part due to a lack of mature fixed-point math

libraries.

Our implementation uses a combination of a few algebraic transformations, approximation functions,
and numerical hacks to compute these formulas with bounded maximum error and reasonable gas

cost.

The rest of this section will be released at the same time as the Bronze release source code.

Controlled vs Finalized Pools
The % Bronze Release%@ allows two basic tiers of trust with respect to pools:

1. Controlled pools are configurable by a “controller” address. Only this address can add or remove
liquidity to the pool (call join or exit ). This type of pool allows the change of pool assets types
and their weights. Note that since the controller is an address, this could in principle implement
arbitrary logic, like managing public deposits in a manner similar to a finalized pool. The key
difference is that official tooling will not recognize it as a “trustless” pool. Controlled pools with
increased trust requirements will be possible with the -~ Silver Release’ .

2. Finalized pools have fixed pool asset types, weights, and fees. Crucially, this
enables join and exit to be publicly accessible in a safe, trustless manner while keeping a

minimal implementation.

Swaps and Exit Fees
The ¢ Bronze Release*@ charges fees in two situations: When traders exchange tokens (via swap and
its variants), and when liquidity providers remove their liquidity from the pool (via exit and its
variants).

Both of these fees are configurable by the controller, but they are also fixed when the pool becomes
finalized.

100% of the swap fee goes to the liquidity providers — the amount of the underlying token that can be
redeemed by each pool token increases.

Most of the exit fee is returned to the liquidity providers who remain in the pool.

This is similar in spirit to a swap fee charged for exchanging pool tokens with underlying tokens.

The rest of the exit fee is transferred to an account controlled by Balancer Labs, Inc, for the

development of ~ Future Releases: .

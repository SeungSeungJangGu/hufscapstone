Blockchain Entrepreneurs See ICO Bubble as Cause for
Wave of Criticism

October 26, 2017 15:01 GMT

Abhishek Pitti, CEO and founder of Nucleus, commented: “What's primarily
driving criticism toward cryptocurrencies is the massive $170 billion bubble
to which it has rapidly grown. Unfortunately, many entrepreneurs conducting
ICOs today lack a basic understanding of how blockchain works. There's
definitely a lot of easy money on the table right now, which has caused every
entrepreneur within even an inkling of an idea to rush toward an ICO, and
thus, has resulted in a lot of criticism toward cryptocurrencies.

The reality is that ICOs are changing the way many technology startups raise
money to fund their projects. The amount of money raised by cryptocurrency
and blockchain startups via ICOs has surpassed early stage venture capital
funding in the last few quarters. ICOs are a way for startups to raise capital
without giving up decision-making power to venture capitalists nor surren-
dering any equity to them. The cat's out of the bag, and ICOs are here to stay
as a form of fundraising.”

Bitcoin Futures Market A Huge Step Forward?

November 1, 2017 2:28 PM

“On its nine-year anniversary, bitcoin has surged to an all-time price high
following an announcement by CME Group to launch bitcoin futures by the
end of the year. While it's not the first to announce plans for bitcoin futures,
CME may have a better chance of obtaining SEC approval for its proposal.
Earlier this year, the SEC rejected a bitcoin ETF proposal put together by the
Winklevoss twins, saying the exchange that wanted to list it could not enter
into necessary surveillance-sharing agreements, given that ‘significan
markets for bitcoin are unregulated’ If CME does manage to achieve this feat,
one of the largest barriers in introducing a bitcoin-based ETF may soon be
removed, which will open up the floodgates for both institutional funds and
retail investors who haven't had exposure to bitcoin to get in on some of the

action. We could very well see bitcoin going multiple folds higher when tha’

happens. However, bitcoin is quite different from traditional commodities like
gold, copper, or rice that are currently traded in the futures markets. Thus,
there will be a lot of teething issues that CME will face, as it does not have any
other commodity that behaves like bitcoin. What's more, this commodity can
be procured in many more unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges around the
globe, which could potentially steer away a lot of traditional and conservative

investors.”

Bitcoin Hits $7,000 Mark As Newborn Bitcoin Gold
Faces Safety Issues

November 2, 2017 10:37 AM EDT

“The intent behind the creation of Bitcoin Gold is to support true decentraliza-
tion of Bitcoin, with the goal of the project being the same goal as any Bitcoin
hard fork: to improve the protocol," said Abhishek Pitti, CEO of cryptocurrency
service provider Nucleus.

One of main objectives with BTG is to change how mining works by making it
so the most powerful mining machines, known as application-specific
integrated circuits ( (aka ASICs), can no longer be used. Pitti explained that by
changing the mining algorithm to be incompatible with ASICs and compatible
with graphics processing units (GPUs), it opens up the mining market to lot
more people. ASICs are expensive and their purpose is singular, and hence
Bitcoin mining currently is centralized around just the big players.

“Consumer-miners cannot mine Bitcoin profitably today, and Bitcoin Gold
aims to change that," said Pitti. "The intent is to revoke power from few
central players who own massive mining farms and transfer that power to a
more decentralized based of GPU miners.’

Pitti added that the irony here is as follows: Bitcoin Gold is pre-mined, and
100,000 BTG is reserved for the BTG developers. This can cause a market
crash if the developers decide to cash out large volumes once Bitcoin Gold
starts to trade.

“It falters on its own premise of true decentralization, a large portion of the
currency will be owned by just a handful of people," said Pitti.
Too Many Forks on Bitcoin Blockchain? A Look Ahead
It's no secret that with Bitcoin constantly reaching new highs, many are
concerned that bubble could burst.

And though the hard fork that created Bitcoin Gold has bolstered Bitcoin
itself, Pitti warns that too many forks on the Bitcoin blockchain cannot be a
good thing.

There is also already rumors of a Bitcoin Silver in the making. This can cause
confusion among new cryptocurrency investors in the years to come.

How Blockchain Can Improve Security of Customer
Data

November 03, 2017, 02:58:52 PM EDT

If you ask most people about bitcoin, they would describe it as a digital
currency. However, those who understand its underlying blockchain technol-
ogy know that it's in fact a digital ledger of tamper-proof transactional data.
This ledger isn't owned by any one company or individual; instead, ownership
is shared by every person who has ever made a transaction in bitcoin or any
other kind of cryptocurrency.

This decentralized nature of blockchain makes it infinitely more secure than
any existing government-regulated system. That's especially critical in an age
in which privacy has become an increasingly pressing issue. Today, giant
Internet corporations monetize customer information through various forms
of advertising solely for their own benefit and have maintained exclusive
control over this data. Blockchain-based protocols shift the power of
controlling and monetizing personal data into the hands of the customers

How Blockchain Can Improve Security of Customer
Data

November 6, 2017 10:20 AM

To most people, bitcoin is simply a digital currency; however, those who
understand its underlying blockchain technology know that it is actually a
unchangeable ledger of all past transactional data. This ledger isn’t owned by
an individual or even a company; rather, there is shared ownership by every
person who has ever made a transaction in bitcoin or any other kind of
cryptocurrency.

Blockchain's decentralized nature makes it more secure than any existing
government-regulated system. This is especially critical in time where privacy
has become an increasingly significant problem. Today, large Internet corpo-
rations have maintained exclusive control over our customer data and have
even monetized information through forms of advertising, solely for their
own benefit. These blockchain-based protocols can allow customers to
control and monetize their own personal data, empowering them in ways
that were previously not possible.

Using blockchain, networks can securely share and obtain consumer prefer-
ences — for instance, your favorite stores could know that you're searching
for deals on a sweater or that you're in the market for a new computer —
without compromising the personal data that you don’t want them to access,
unless you authorize it. One way that blockchain is able to do this is through
the use of a private key. Using blockchain with private keys, people can pick
and choose to authorize only select networks to access their personal data.
Smart contracts are another way that blockchain can safeguard privacy.
Smart contracts are computer protocols that can verify, facilitate, and enforce
terms of a contract by accessing external data off of the blockchain. This
technology can replace the role of intermediaries by ensuring that all partici-
pating parties aren adhering to the laws of the transaction. In terms of retail,
smart contracts ensure that all parties are operating under the same set of
rules, preventing the chance of any malpractice.

The brick-and-mortar retail industry can significantly benefit from the adop-
tion of blockchain. In fact, blockchain could spearhead the creation of a
system that would let brick-and-mortar retailers provide a personalized
shopping experience to anyone who walks into their stores using data that
the customers can willingly choose to share. While this is exciting, the
thought that retailers might be able to access your personal information can
still seem a bit invasive. This is only heightened in the wake of recent critical
hacks of customer information, such as the recent Equifax breach that
compromised the personal data of over 143 million people.

However, with blockchain, customers can control exactly who is able to see
their data, and even potentially monetize it when coupled with a cryptocur-
rency-based economy. A blockchain-based system could notify customers
when a retailer wants to access to their consumer data, and can choose to
deny or approve authorization to them. With the advent of blockchain, these
heightened levels of data protection have become a reality, and it will prove
critical in ensuring that consumers are fully in control of the privacy and secu-
rity of their own personal data.

Bitcoin Gold aims to break up a mining monopoly

November 6, 2017

Abhishek Pitti, CEO and founder of Nucleus, said that supporters of Bitcoin
Gold believe it will help shift the power away from big centralized miners to
individual users.

The naysayers’ side
Many question Bitcoin Gold based on the technical aspects of the solution
and the issues it raises with bitcoin as a brand.

“Saturating the market with different versions of bitcoin is confusing to users,
and discredits the claim that there are a limited number of bitcoins — since
you can always fork it and double the supply,’ Sol Lederer, blockchain director
at LOOMIA, wrote in an email.

“Instead of coming to agreement, the community, developers, and code are
fracturing into different groups. We're learning that while a blockchain gives

you consensus on a distributed ledger, it does not give you consensus on the
codebase — that is, what code to run. This does not bode well for bitcoin's
future, where it will face new and bigger challenges requiring further
upgrades to the codebase.’

Luis Cuende, co-founder and project lead at Aragon, thinks Bitcoin Gold is not
a good solution for technical reasons. He claims that Bitcoin Gold lacks replay
protection, a safeguard that prevents network attacks intended to repeat or
delay valid data transmission.

Pitti also sees this as a critical problem with previous hard forks such as
Bitcoin Cash. Because it lacked replay protection and backward compatibility,
many major developers refused to accept it, according to Pitti.

If you ask the majority of people about bitcoin, they would describe it as
simply a digital currency.

However, those who understand its underlying blockchain technology know
that it's in fact a ledger of tamper-proof transactional data. This ledger isn't
owned by any single company or individual; rather, ownership is shared by
every person who has ever made a transaction in bitcoin or any other kind of

privacy has become an increasingly significant problem. Today, large Internet
corporations monetize customer information through various forms of
advertising solely for their own benefit and have maintained exclusive control
over this data. Blockchain-based protocols allow customers to control and
monetize their own personal data, empowering them in unprecedented ways.

Blockchain offers a way for networks to securely obtain and share consumer
preferences — for instance, letting your favorite stores know that you're
searching for deals on a pair of boots or that you're in the market for anew TV
— without compromising the personal information that you don't want them
to access, unless you personally authorize it. One way that blockchain is able
to achieve this is through the use of private keys. Using private keys over
blockchain, people can choose to authorize only select networks to obtain
their personal data.
The use of smart contracts is another way that blockchain can safeguard

Still, the thought that retailers might be able to access your personal informa-
tion can seem a bit invasive.That sentiment is only heightened by recent
critical hacks of customer information, such as the recent Equifax breach that
compromised the personal data of more than 143 million people.

However, with blockchain, potential customers can control exactly which
parties are able to see their data,and even potentially monetize it when it's
coupled with a cryptocurrency-based economy. A blockchain-based system
could notify customers when a retailer would like to access to their consumer
data, and can choose to approve or deny authorization to them. As blockchain
becomes increasingly popular, these heightened levels of data protection and
customer awareness of its use have become a reality, and it will prove critical
in ensuring that consumers are fully in control of the security and privacy of
their own data.

Ether price jumps as bitcoin’s planned split is canceled

November 8, 2017 4:30 PM ET

Some other members of the virtual-currency community agreed. “Canceling
SegWit2x is a step in the right direction, and it looks like Bitcoin Core's road
map will prevail for now,’ said Abhishek Pitti, CEO of Nucleus Vision, a block-
chain related company.

Blockchain refers to a distributed, immutable ledger which serves as the
backbone for all cryptocurrencies.

On Tuesday, the value of Ether tokens took a hit following reports that a user
on a Parity Technologies wallet “accidentally” triggered a vulnerability in a
recent coding upgrade that resulted in that user becoming the sole owner of

a group of wallets totaling between $150 million and $300 million.

Is lot technology transforming brick and mortar retail?

November 13, 2017

Many startups have made this omnichannel retail vision a reality, with Nucle-
us being one of them. The idea behind Nucleus's loT solutions was to elimi-
nate the inefficiencies within brick and mortar retail.

“With Nucleus, we can create a better world by providing personalized experi-
ences to end users while ensuring privacy,” Abhishek Pitti, CEO of Nucleus,
told Tech Wire Asia.

Nucleus's loT solution captures and provides previously inaccessible data to
brick and mortar businesses through blockchain and sensor technology. With
this data, the Nucleus platform mines intelligence, helping businesses
provide customized experiences to their customers.

The aim of Nucleus is to ensure next-level personalization for customers.
“With Nucleus, every shopper is made to feel special when they walk into a
retail store,’ said Pitti.

For retailers, Nucleus is a powerful solution. The “e-commerce-esque”
personalization can result in better targeting and higher relevance in regard to
promotional activities.

According to Pitti: “[Retailers] simply connect the ION (loT) sensor and they
become part of the Nucleus ecosystem. With the Nucleus ecosystem, they
gain access to a vast and secure data exchange system that gives them
critical insights about walk-in customers.

“With this data, Nucleus helps retailers to incentivize walk-ins in the store,
increase in-store conversions, grow average customer basket size, and, most
importantly, earn customer loyalty.”
However, with this personalization comes the question of customer data
privacy and security. Fortunately, Nucleus utilizes blockchain technology to
address this issue, allowing the customer to have complete control over how
their data is managed and shared.

“Each request to access a customer's data on the blockchain will triger a
notification to the customer, prompting them to authorize the transfer.
Furthermore, retailers will have to pay users for their data, instead of
networks with mass data. This not only ensures higher data integrity but also
helps retailers pick and choose specific data points.”

Not only does the retailer need customer authorization in order to obtain their
data, they also need to pay the customer nCash tokens — the cryptocurrency
of Nucleus — as a data acquisition cost.

These micropayments will be made in real-time on the blockchain to the
customer's Nucleus wallet, which can later be used as reward points in any
Nucleus retail store. The same can also be exchanged for real currencies
across the world.

According to Pitti, Nucleus has received a great response from the retail
industries so far.

“We are already live in 10 stores in India, with 19 of our proprietary sensors
installed between them. Over 33,000 walk-ins have been identified, with an
authorization rate of more than 10 percent among customers. These
customers were sent around 2,000 offers, and of those offers, 75 percent
were redeemed. This signifies success for us; these numbers more than
validate the potential of Nucleus in retail”

3 Catastrophic Events Could Sink Bitcoin

November 30, 2017 4:48 PM EST

“Banning bitcoin in any democratic country will be extremely difficult," said
Abhishek Pitti, CEO of Nucleus Vision. "Bitcoin's decentralized approach to
currency is very people-centric and as it becomes more mainstream, more
people will understand its benefit. Any democratic government that bans
something so beneficial for the people risks losing power."

“Bitcoin has found a way to overcome many obstacles in the past," said Pitti.
“The industry learned from Mt. Gox and wallets and exchanges have dramati-
cally stepped up their security game."

2018 predictions from bitcoin and blockchain experts |
#VentureCanvas

December 14, 2017

“Blockchain is a powerful tool that can bring positive change in many indus-
tries, and we foresee that advancements in encryption technology and
cryptography, coupled with blockchain, will be the recipe for success in the
security industry in 2018. For instance, the Equifax data hack is something
that needed more than just blockchain to have prevented it. While blockchain
technology could have really helped customers assert. Thus there is more
control over their own personal data owned by the company, bad security
practices would have left them vulnerable, with or without blockchain.

Where blockchain's security features will really come into their own will be in
their coupling with loT. With an ever-increasing number of connected devices.
2018 will need blockchain's security architecture to protect loT applications.
Besides, users from sophisticated data breaches. | strongly believe that 2017
was only a trailer for what is to come in 2018 across the entire blockchain
ecosystem and sector.”

Abhishek Pitti, CEO of Nucleus Vision, agrees that a sudden crash in value is

inevitable; historically this kind of tremendous growth in bitcoin value has
never been sustainable.

There is always a possibility that bitcoin could depreciate so much in value
that it will useless for either investment or use as currency. That said, it's
more likely that bitcoin will persist and carry on.

Nucleus Vision (NCASH) — is Public

February 27, 2018 @ 2:23 pm

Nucleus Vision (NCASH) - What is Nucleus Vision? Nucleus Vision was
founded at Harvard University and came to be a fully developed product by
2016. It is an loT-based, contactless identification system that empowers
retailers to identify and better serve their customers. Combining individual
identities with Data, they set out to “connect the unconnected.’ Funded by
Tim Draper, this cryptocurrency sets out to personalize users retail
experiences with their own data.

The Nucleus Vision technology brings intelligent layers of customer data to
the offline world, previously only capable in commerce. The proprietary
sensor technology identifies your presence as soon as you enter the shop

with your unique phone signal — with no wifi or facial recognition. This data is
securely transferred to the retail worker through blockchain. The blockchain
layer ensures that all customer information flows accurately to all parties.
Once the customer has given consent to make a transaction, the data is then
mapped with retailers customer database in combination with data from the
extended Nucleus retailer ecosystem. All of the information stored in the
blockchain feeds into the advanced platform, the Neuron Network. During
your shopping experience this [platform converts all of the raw data into
actionable insights, which allows the retailers to offer the best services
tailored to your specific needs.

Here is a youtube video that explains the goal of nCASH and Nucleus Vision:

effort and list its nCash token directly on exchanges. CEO of Nucleus Vision,
Abhishek Pitti, called the support of the investment firms a critical step in
moving forward to accomplish their mission to transform the retail industry.
“Their extensive knowledge of the blockchain space will prove to be an
invaluable asset to Nucleus Visions as we apply this technology to transform
the customer experience in retail stores around the world.” Patti says this in

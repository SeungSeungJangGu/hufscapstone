| The Sweetbridge solution

Supply chain management involves the production, movement and storage of almost everything we

interact with each day, which involves extensive cooperation between many organisations in order to

get a product or service built and delivered to your door. Despite supply chain management being a well

established science for managing commerce, there are a number of systemic problems that

Sweetbridge looks to solve:

Lack of liquidity: $3.9T of supply chain assets are
tied up globally at any given moment

Inefficient allocation of resources: only 75% of supply
chain assets are utilised globally at any given time

High Risks Inherent in Optimization: Organizations

find it difficult to measure the performance of their
systems and, consequently, to retain effective talent

for the purpose of supply chain optimization

Disruptive Change: the disruptive pace of
technological change means that supply chain
participators need more agility, transparency,
and efficiency.

What is Sweetbridge?

Sweetbridge addresses supply chain issues
through its five ‘layers of digital rules’ built on
top of cutting edge ‘blockchain’ technology,
as outlined in the adjacent chart.

Blockchains simply enable data to be
decentralised, and the technology creates
secure transaction data in an immutable
ledger - meaning no trusted third party can
change It.

“Blockchain” is a popular word at the moment
but not always understood. Analogous to
viewing a webpage without understanding the
full workings of the internet, a user can use
the Sweetcoin technology to solve issues ina
supply chain, without needing to know all the
inner workings of the blockchain.

Enables owned assets to more easily be converted
to cash

Enables assets to be more easily shared

Enables more accurate performance
measurement of the systems an organisation
uses, the goal being to allow organisations to
focus on retaining effective talent

Enables the management of supply chains to
become more flexible and scalable in response to
the pace at which technology Is changing.

| How it works?

The fundamental mechanics of Sweetbridge involve the use of “Sweetcoin” and “Bridgecoin” crypto-
tokens for assets you place into an ‘Asset Vault”:

Purchase
Assets
—_—_—_—_———— . .
1 Bridgecoin
Sweetcoin i Convert to Fiat
—_—_—_—_———— IT
Asset Vault Pay Invoices

- Your assets become collateral, which are deposited and locked in an asset vault “smart contract”

- This smart contract issues Bridgecoin (BRC) as a loan on your own assets (UoU) without the need of
an intermediary. BRC can be held or exchanged for Fiat.

- When Bridgecoin is repaid the collateral is unlocked and may be sold allowing owners to redeem the
pledged assets.

- Sweetcoin (SWC) is a discount coupon that when activated in your vault can be used to offset interest
on the UoU.

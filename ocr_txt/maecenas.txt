“A new online marketplace promises to give art lovers the
chance to buy shares in famous paintings.”

VISION

Investing in a Monet has always been
beyond the reach of most people;
purchasing a Rembrandt the privilege
of only a few... until now. The opaque
world of auction houses and banks,
which allows them to charge
exorbitant fees, has cut off fine art
investment from efficient modern
markets.

But it does not have to be that way.

With help from visionaries like you,
we can democratise access to fine art
by creating a_ truly open platform
where investors can own a piece of a
Picasso. We are building a global art
blockchain market where assets are
traded quickly and fairly on a liquid
exchange. Creating portfolios and

trading certificates representing a
part of a masterpiece will be available
to everyone that is part of the
Maecenas community. We will
convert million-dollar artworks into
smaller digitised financial units that
can be bought and sold easily —
literally at a fraction of the cost.

For the first time, technology will
allow investors, collectors and owners
to exchange shares in paintings and
sculptures instantly, akin to the way
stocks of acompany are traded today.
Plus, top emerging artists will have a
showcase for their work, free from
the interference of middlemen.

For years, we have been building a
secure and robust technology

- The Telegraph

foundation for Maecenas, the world’s
first blockchain-based fine art
marketplace. This has been possible
because we have assembled an
exceptional team of experts and have
built crucial relationships — with
galleries, collectors and
authenticators. Now, with your
support, we will be able to launch the
platform, nurture this new
investment network and turn a
centuries-old industry mainstream.

Thanks to its resilience in downturns
and to its capital appreciation, fine art
has long been an attractive multi-
billion asset class.

Now it will be open to all.

THE ART MARKET OPPORTUNITY

There is an estimated $3 trillion worth
of fine art in safe storage, of which
circa $65 billion are traded annually
through auction houses and art
dealers.’

Fine art is considered a reliable and
safe store of value. Wealthy families
have kept art in their portfolios for
centuries, and trading volumes have
continued to grow steadily over the
last few decades. Interest in fine art
among investors and wealth
managers is on the rise, and younger
generations of buyers are eager to
embrace art-tech.

Asset Performance

But the $65 billion annual fine art
industry is in desperate need of open
and fair marketplaces that create
transparency and _ liquidity. The
antiquated industry is struggling to
see trading volumes reach their real
potential. The problem is that access
to information is patchy, and art
pieces are traded at outdated venues.
Sales are processed manually and
settlement can take weeks. This
opaque and_ inefficient process
discourages many potential investors,
which meansart trades are infrequent
and art as an asset is illiquid. In

addition, many investors favour using
financial vehicles over direct
ownerships because they want
exposure to art but don’t want the
responsibility of having to care for the
physical art piece.

Fine art remains one of the rare few
markets that have remained virtually
unchanged for the last three centuries.
It has been impervious to the
technology advances that have been
adopted by the majority of capital
markets like company stocks, bonds,
commodities and even real estate.

REMOVING INTERMEDIARIES

2
A
&
A

But now blockchain can provide the
foundation for a secure and efficient
market that enables buyers and
sellers to transact directly without
intermediaries. An open, agile
platform can energise art markets
and bring millions of investors off the
side-lines.

Weare named after — and inspired by
— an early patron of the arts. Gaius
Maecenas helped democratise art in
Ancient Rome by financing poor
poets. We want to be the modern
version of Maecenas (pronounced
“My-seen-us”) ensuring that fine art is
available to everyone and not just the
ultra-wealthy.

The lack of innovation within art
finance stems from the dominance of
old auction houses. The largest —
Sotheby's and Christies —
monopolise 80% of the secondary
market volume. They present an
identical fee structure, which can see
art buyers paying up to 25 percent
commission — and sellers are charged
even more."

Auction houses also control access to
information as there is no single art

marketplace that provides a proper
price discovery mechanism. In other
words, it’s nearly impossible to know
the fair price of an artwork because
there are no reliable means for
investors to assess market sentiment.
In other asset classes, like public
company stocks or even
cryptocurrencies, any investor can tap
into historical and real-time exchange
price feeds to build pricing models.

The fine art industry doesn’t have any
of that. There are no order books or
exchanges, and historical information
is both scarce and sparse since art
pieces are traded so infrequently.

Masterpieces will be traded briskly
through an open exchange, giving
frequent updates of what the
artworks are really worth. Portfolio
managers will be able to price their
positions more accurately and
diversify their risk by investing in a
range of different art assets. They will
no longer need to have their funds
concentrated in a handful of hard-to-
sell pieces.

[2 [2 [2 [2

Fine art should become a first-class
citizen in capital markets and have
rich market data feeds, order books,
indices and even derivatives.

The reason auction houses have
dominated and controlled the fine art
market for so long can be explained in
a single word: TRUST.

Lack of information and reliable ways
of assessing the authenticity of art
pieces means that investors deal
mostly only with centuries-old
institutions that are perceived as
trustworthy. These institutions act as
intermediaries in almost every art
transaction and therefore control the
market.

Blockchains

networks of trust.

replace __ traditional
with decentralised

By connecting artists, collectors and
investors directly via an open
blockchain platform with smart
contracts, we eliminate the need for
brokers and art dealers to facilitate a
transaction. We replace the need for
trust based on reputation with trust in
the decentralised blockchain.

THE EMERGENCE OF ART-TECH

"Technology-driven businesses have a
clear potential to support the
emergence of Art & Finance, through
increased liquidity, lower transaction
costs and more transparency”

- Deloitte Art & Finance Report 2016

In recent years, — technology
innovation has started to permeate
into the traditional fine art industry.

According to the Deloitte Art Finance
Report 2016, “increasing investment
in art market start-ups demonstrates
continued confidence in the growth
of the online art and technology
industry”. In addition, “the level of
investment in art industry start-ups
increased from an estimated US$125

$10,330,000

million in 2013 to an estimated
US$505 million in 2015 based on 23
art market start-ups.”

Other findings by the Deloitte Art
Finance Report 2016 show that the art
market is increasingly more receptive
to the usage of technology and it
anticipates it playing an important
role in the next two to three years. It
also cites blockchain technologies as
an example of an innovation that
could contribute significantly to the
development of the art and finance
industry.

"73 percent of art professionals (up
from 53 percent) and 69 percent of
collectors believe that online art

businesses will play an important role
in the art market in the next two to
three years, which signals that art
stakeholders are increasingly waking
up to the potential of technology and
the online art market. New innovations,
such as the use of blockchain
technologies mentioned above, are an
example of how technology and
innovation could contribute
significantly to the development of the
art and finance industry.”

- Deloitte Art & Finance Report 2016
COMPETITION

Art investors have limited options
when it comes to investing in fine art
in a secure and trusted way.

Auction houses are perceived as
being the safest channel, and that is
reflected in the high fees which range
between 12 percent and 25 percent.
These auctions are mostly conducted
in the traditional way, and little has
changed besides the usage of TV
monitors to track bids in addition to
calling the bids out loud.

Art galleries and other art dealers
charge lower fees to buyers, in the
range of 6 percent to 10 percent.
However, these are perceived as less
trustworthy, and their art selection is
quite limited. In addition, galleries
dictate prices instead of market
participants.

Besides the lack of liquidity, lack of
transparency and the high fees, both
of these approaches also require
having to physically acquire the

Meecenas

artwork, store it, manage it and look
after it. This is something that most
investors are uncomfortable with
because they are not qualified art
experts. An estimated 90% of buyers
see art as an investment, and nearly
half of them would prefer to have
exposure to fine art through a
financial vehicle instead of a physical
purchase. So the _ traditional
approaches offered by galleries and
auction houses leave a huge part of
the market under-served.

One alternative to these two
traditional approaches is to
participate in an art fund. The way
this works is that a qualified art expert
acts as the art fund manager. They
identify a collection of art pieces that
are of good value and have potential
to appreciate. Investment from
investors is solicited, with a minimum
of $500,000 typically being required,
and larger ticket sizes being the norm.
The art expert then uses the funds to

buy the collection, and sits on it for
between 5 and 10 years until they can
find suitable buyers willing to pay a
premium for the pieces. After the last
art piece is sold, the fund is dissolved
and investors finally get their money
back, plus any returns. The art fund
manager typically charges investors 2%
per annum of any cash invested plus
20% of any profits made. This means
that on a ten-year horizon, investors
will lose out on about a fifth of their
investment in commissions, and on
top of that lose another fifth of any
profits made. In other words, there is
no guarantee of making money even
if the art appreciates, and it’s not
uncommon to make a loss if the fund
fails to perform as expected.

The high fees combined with the
large minimum investment and the
lack of liquidity (minimum lock-in
period of 5 years) makes these art
funds unsuitable for most investors.

There are non-financial blockchain
initiatives in the fine art space which
don’t have an investment focus.
Instead, they attempt to solve issues
around provenance of traditional art
pieces and protection of digital
artworks. A prominent example is
Verisart which provides permanent
digital art provenance for actual
artworks that would typically be
stored in galleries. Another start-up is
Ascribe, which focuses on providing a
secure way to trace digital artworks
and control how they're shared.

But fintech start-ups are beginning to
emerge with innovative alternatives
to invest in art. Arthena, based in the
US, is one such example, which uses a
typical crowd-funding approach to
create art funds. This new model is
proving to be popular with investors
as it reduces the ticket size to $10,000
and waives the 2% management fee
(although it still charges the 20%
performance price). Although this is
definitely an improvement over
traditional art funds, this approach
still fails to address the fundamental
issues of art investment, namely the
lack of transparency, lack of liquidity,

and most importantly the fact that
trust is centralised.

Maecenas, on the other hand, aims at
leveraging blockchain technology to
fully democratise access to fine art
investment. By tokenising art, the
platform converts million-dollar
artworks into smaller financial units
that can be bought and sold easily
globally through a transparent
marketplace. This provides investors
with liquidity and a much-needed
market-driven price _— discovery
mechanism.
OUR PLATFORM

Maecenas uses blockchain
technology to create tamper-proof
digital certificates linked to pieces of
art. These certificates are highly
secure thanks to the cryptographic
properties of blockchains. A single
artwork is broken down _ into
thousands of certificates, similar to
how a public company issues shares.
Investors can then purchase these
certificates to own a percentage of a
given artwork, and they can sell them
back to other investors at any time via
the Maecenas marketplace.

When Maecenas platform is fully
operative, new artworks will be
continuously listed on the platform
after passing a strict due diligence
process. This involves verifying the art
provenance, insurance policy, safe
storage, independent — valuation,
artwork condition and verification on
the registry of loss and stolen art.
Only high-quality artworks with a
pristine track record will be listed.

Meecenas

Once listed on the platform, artworks

go through a_ bidding process
following a Dutch auction process
whereby investors submit private bids
stating how many certificates
representing a fraction of the artwork
they want to purchase and at what
price. This is essentially a confidential
and cryptographically secure book-
building exercise. This process not
only gives investors bargaining power
but it also provides them with a much
fairer and transparent pricing
mechanism. In addition, it is harder to
manipulate compared to traditional
auctions or fixed-price listings.

The auction process does not happen
instantly but rather it takes place over
a number of days or weeks to allow all
members of the Maecenas’
community to participate. When
Maecenas platform is fully operative
artworks will be listed in any fiat
currency (e.g. USD, EUR) or
cryptocurrency (e.g. BTC, ETH).
Conversely, investors may also prefer
to invest in either fiat currencies or in
cryptocurrencies, effectively creating

a multi-currency conversion scenario.
Utilising a

native currency-independent token
as proxy for all currency conversion
allows us to eliminate currency
conversion risks.

This token will be called ART.

OUR TECHNOLOGY

The platform's design provides fault
tolerance and simple recovery
mechanisms. The system is also
highly scalable, resilient and easy to
upgrade. It has a high degree of
reusability and allows us to be agile in
our development.

For instance, when we need to
integrate Maecenas with an external
service (e.g. a payment processor) we
just create a new micro-service to
handle that and link it to the rest of
the services via message queues. This
has the benefit of letting our
developers simultaneously work on
different tasks and makes integration
and testing relatively simple.
THE ART TOKEN

ART — The currency of the Maecenas
economy.

When Maecenas platform is fully
operative, the ARTwill be the digital
token that is required by all Maecenas
functions that are exposed on the
blockchain via smart contracts.

We believe that the art market is in
desperate need of transparency and
fairness. Therefore, we've decided
that all sensitive business logic
dealing with money or assets will be
run on a public and decentralised
blockchain. This ensures that our
processes can be publicly audited and
known upfront.

The main and most significant
function of our platform is the Dutch
auction. This is the process that
receives bids from investors and
issues digital shares of paintings.
Running such a critical part of our
system on an open and transparent
platform like Ethereum allows the
entire community to scrutinise our
operations. It also protects Maecenas

Meecenas

itself from any potential internal
manipulation or insider trading.
These smart contracts that we're
creating, including the Dutch auction
contract, will require ART to operate.
ART is like the fuel of the
decentralised Maecenas machine.
Any fiat or crypto amounts being
invested through smart contracts will
be first given a value in ART first.
Having our own token allows us to
collect income from these smart
contract activities. The utility of these
tokens is that ART can perform
different platform functions.

In the case of our Dutch auction, ART
acts as a clearing and settlement
mechanism that Maecenas uses to
issue digital shares of paintings. The
more paintings are auctioned the
higher the demand for ART will be.

ART has a fixed supply, so we
anticipate that the increasing
economic activity of Maecenas will
play a strong role in the market
dynamics of ART in crypto exchanges.
The rationale here is that as the
Maecenas economy grows, the

market cap of ART - the Maecenas

currency - should also grow with it.
That is our reasoning. Of course,
nobody can know or guarantee if the
value will or won't go up.

Still, the economy of Maecenas is not
limited to just running auctions. For
example, artworks in our platform can
be leased to museums for exhibitions.
The income generated by this activity
is then distributed proportionally to
holders of fractions of paintings or
sculptures. This leasing and income
collection function is also performed
by smart contracts and therefore
requires ART tokens to work.

Besides, as the Maecenas ecosystem
grows, we anticipate creating
additional income-generating
processes. Many of these will require
smart contracts to operate (for the
reasons stated above), therefore
further increasing the demand for
ART.

ART plays a crucial role within
Maecenas. It enables our platform to
operate transparently and openly ina
decentralised space while at the same

Meecenas

time deriving revenue from those

activities. '
THE DUTCH vo

An art owner decides to sell an artwork on the Maecenas platform, and chooses in which currency to receive the
proceeds. This could be ART tokens, cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies.

Investors participate in the auction by submitting ART tokens to the auction smart contract. For those investors
wanting to participate with fiat currencies or other cryptocurrencies, deposits are kept in a per-investor fully-
segregated virtual bank account..

The Maecenas platform, upon reception of monies, allocates an equivalent amount of ART tokens to the investor
and pledges the tokens on the smart contract on behalf of the investor. Maecenas uses its ART reserve funds to
guarantee liquidity, and converts the submitted funds into ART seamlessly to ensure a good user experience.

When the Dutch auction process finishes, the smart contract proceeds to analyse all bids to determine the final
share price and the amount of shares each successful investor ends up purchasing.

The smart contract settles the transaction by issuing artwork crypto-certificated to investors. The artwork seller

receives either the ART tokens or the equivalent amount in currency depending on what they chose before the
auction started.

WORLD-CLASS FINE ART

We have worked very hard to build a strong shortlist of flagship artworks that qualify to be listed on our platform. We now
have access toa diverse pipeline of art pieces by blue-chip artists that collectively is worth in excess of one-hundred million
dollars. This initial lot is an excellent starting point that will allow us to have good volume and traction when we launch.

These are some of the names that could make it into the initial collection.

* Impressionist and Modern: Picasso, Monet, Braque, Pissarro, Giacometti, Brancusi, Modigliani, Renoir, Chagall,
Munch, Sisley.

* Post-War and Classical Contemporary: Warhol, Basquiat, Lichtenstein, Soulages, Beuys, Duchamp, Bacon, Sam
Francis, Dubuffet, Bourgeois.

LEGAL & COMPLIANCE
One of the challenges that we face when we started defining the business model of Maecenas was to figure out how to
structure the art investments in a way that would not infringe financial regulations, while at the same time provide

security and protection for investors.

For that purpose, we are engaging withnumerous art finance experts, law firms and investment professionals worldwide
to seek advice and to determine the best legal and financial structure to enable secure co-investment in fine art,

Since this has never been done before,

The result of this effort is a very

KEEPING ART SAFE BUT NOT HIDDEN

Every artwork listed on the platform will be kept in purpose-built safe art storage facilities.

These high-security vaults actually also operate as galleries whereby dedicated rooms are allocated for viewing purposes.
Maecenas, in its effort to democratise access to fine art, will allow investors and their nominated guests to arrange visits

to appreciate the artworks.

These art storage facilities typically sit within international designated areas next to airports so that the valuables kept in
storage do not attract local tax when they're transacted, making it attractive for investors.

Known as freeports, these facilities are available in most tier-1 art trading hubs and we have already established
relationships with many of them. One such facility is Le Freeport in Singapore where Christie's operates their Fine Art

Storage Services (CFASS).

Equivalent facilities exist worldwide, namely:

TARGET SEGMENTS AND TRENDS

Maecenas' target market is sizeable in its own right. In addition, we capitalise on a number of recent investment trends
which are set to continue:

The Shared Economy:
Maecenas allows investors to syndicate and jointly own a piece of art. This model has been validated at large by the
continual increase in popularity of the many property and equity crowdfunding platforms available.

Cryptocurrencies:

Investment in cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets has grown exponentially over the last few years. The value of many of
these digital assets has increased Sox in less than a year. Trading volumes at crypto-exchanges are at all-time highs and
show no sign of slowing down.

The value proposition of cryptographic tokens is simple: democratise access to wealth. Blockchains allow investors to be
in full control of their digital assets without having to rely on intermediaries or be exposed to central counterparties.

Maecenas capitalises on this trend by opening up trillions of dollars’ worth of fine art to the crypto investor community.

Investment in Art Finance Innovation:
The investment in art-related start-ups quadrupled in the last two years reaching over $500m a year.

Art as Collateral:

Art finance is expected to grow significantly. The US art-secured lending market has grown an estimated 15 to 20 percent
annually for the last five years.

Self-Investment:

50 REVENUE FORECAST
(IN MILLIONS) $43.72

USD (Million)

Year | Year 2 Year 3 Year 4

12
Meecenas

Over the coming years, more and more money will be handed to younger generations, who are actively looking to
participate in the decision making of their investments. The behaviour of this digitally native generation favours digital-
first platforms and the ability to self-invest. Millennials are going to be the largest adult segment by 2020.

Alternative Investments:
The younger generation of investors favour tangible assets over traditional capital market products, such as government

bonds and stocks. These products are currently offering negative or very low interest rates, making alternative assets
even more attractive.

BUSINESS MODEL

Our business model is based primarily on two revenue streams: issuance and secondary market.

* Issuance: Artworks listed on Maecenas attract a one-time issuance fee of 6% which is charged to asset owners.
Investors participating in auctions pay a 2% one-off fee. These fees are charged on settled transactions only.

* Fine Art Marketplace: Shares or certificates representing rights on artworks will be available on Maecenas Fine Art

Exchange.
It will always be free to sell your auction-acquired shares or certificated, while buyers will pay a commission.

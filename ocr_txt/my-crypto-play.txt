Empower every crypto trader on the planet to experience fantasy
trading

The idea behind the inception of MCP is to argue that the
cryptocurrency market can be conceived as a fantasy trading
project. Envisioning the cryptocurrency market within the
fantasy sports framework, can simulate the crypto market
investment and improve the chances of success

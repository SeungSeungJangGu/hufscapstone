Disclaimers

The SafePal White Paper has been published and issued by SafePal Wallet for informational purposes only
and is required to be read alongside the Terms if the prospective purchaser plans to use any of the SafePal

the Terms are outlined. This Whitepaper does not constitute a prospectus for the purposes of [Directive
2003/71/EEC, and the amending directive 2010/73/EU] [Regulation (EU) 2017/1129], and is not intended to
constitute an offer of securities or a solicitation for investments in securities in any jurisdiction. The purpose
of this Whitepaper is to provide potential purchasers with the information on SafePal’s ecosystem to allow
the purchasers to make their own decision as to whether or not it wishes to proceed to purchase SafePal
Tokens and use any of the SafePal ecosystem of products.

Disclaimers

This Whitepaper does not constitute an offer or invitation, or any other sale or purchase of shares, securities,
or any of the assets. Any possession of SFP shall not grant any rights in any form to the user, including but
not limited to any rights of ownership, interest, profit, redemption, property or intellectual property, decision
making, or any other such rights, such as any rights of financial or legal nature, in SafePal the corporation or
its affiliates. SFP may be used for protocol and ecosystem governance which has no bearing to the
corporation or its affiliates.

Users from the following countries or regions will not be able to participate in the SFP token sales:

Australia, Belarus, China, Democratic Republic of Congo,Cuba, Iraq, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, United
States of America and its territories (American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and
the U.S. Virgin Islands), Zimbabwe.

Risks

You acknowledge and agree that there are numerous risks associated with purchasing SFP, holding SFP, and
using SFP for participation in the SafePal Platform. In the worst scenario, this could lead to the loss of all or
part of the SFP which had been purchased. IF YOU DECIDE TO PURCHASE SFP, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE,
ACCEPT AND ASSUME THE FOLLOWING RISKS:

1. Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions

The regulatory status of SFP and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions.
The regulation of virtual currencies has become a primary target of regulation in all major countries in the
world. It is impossible to predict how, when or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulations
or create new regulations with respect to such technology and its applications, including SFP and/or the
SafePal Platform. Regulatory actions could negatively impact SFP and/or the SafePal Platform in various
ways. The Foundation, the Distributor (or their respective affiliates) may cease operations in a jurisdiction in
the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such
jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such
jurisdiction. After consulting with a wide range of legal advisors and continuous analysis of the development
and legal structure of virtual currencies, a cautious approach will be applied towards the sale of SFP.
Therefore, for the token sale, the sale strategy may be constantly adjusted in order to avoid relevant legal
risks as much as possible.

Risks

2. Inadequate disclosure of information
As at the date hereof, the SafePal Platform is still under development and its design concepts, codes, and
other technical details and parameters may be constantly and frequently updated and changed. Although
this white paper contains the most current information relating to the SafePal Platform, it is not absolutely
complete and may still be adjusted and updated by the SafePal team from time to time. The SafePal team
has no ability and obligation to keep holders of SFP informed of every detail (including development
progress and expected milestones) regarding the project to develop the SafePal Platform, hence insufficient
information disclosure is inevitable and reasonable.

3. Competitors

Various types of crypto management platforms are emerging at a rapid rate, and the industry is increasingly
competitive. It is possible that alternative parties could be established that utilize the same or similar code
and protocol underlying the SafePal Open Wallet Platform and attempt to re-create similar facilities. The
SafePal Platform may be required to compete with these alternative parties, which could negatively impact
SFP and/or the SafePal Platform.

Risks

4. Loss of Talent

The development of the SafePal Platform greatly depends on the continued co-operation of the existing
technical team and expert consultants, who are highly knowledgeable and experienced in their respective
sectors. The loss of any member may adversely affect the SafePal Platform or its future development. Further,
stability and cohesion within the team is critical to the overall development of the SafePal Platform. There is
the possibility that conflict within the team and/or departure of core personnel may occur, resulting in
negative influence on the project in the future.

5. Failure to develop

There is the risk that the development of the SafePal Platform will not be executed or implemented as
planned, for a variety of reasons, including without limitation the event of a decline in the prices of any
digital asset, virtual currency or SFP, unforeseen technical difficulties, and shortage of development funds
for activities.

Risks

6.Security weaknesses
Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with SFP and/or the SafePal
Platform in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, phishing attacks, supply chain
attacks, and brutal attacks. Furthermore, there is a risk that a third party or a member of the Foundation, the
Distributor or their respective affiliates may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the
core infrastructure of SFP and/or the SafePal Platform, which could negatively affect SFP and/or the SafePal
Platform.

Further, the future of cryptography and security innovations are highly unpredictable and advances in
cryptography, or technical advances (including without limitation development of quantum computing),
could present unknown risks to SFP and/or the SafePal Platform by rendering ineffective the cryptographic
consensus mechanism that underpins that blockchain protocol.

7.Other risks

In addition, the potential risks briefly mentioned above are not exhaustive and there are other risks
associated with your purchase, holding and use of SFP, including those that the Foundation or the Distributor
cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the
aforementioned risks. You should conduct full due diligence on the Foundation, the Distributor, their
respective affiliates, and the SafePal team, as well as understand the overall framework, mission and vision
for the SafePal Platform prior to purchasing SFP. 8

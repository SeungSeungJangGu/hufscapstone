Bringing the $1 billion auto repossession industry
onto the blockchain.

JUST GOT EASIER.
WE’RE HERE TO
TELL YOU

HOW.

The $1 billion auto repossession industry is growing quickly due to the sharp increase in
new and subprime auto loans in the past five years. Unfortunately, the repossession
industry has not seen any meaningful innovation during that time and is plagued by steep
costs and inefficiencies.

Repo Coin plans to change that. We are introducing a revolutionary solution that will give
auto lenders and repossession companies the ability to do business more efficiently and
at a lower cost by using smart contracts on our blockchain network.

Additionally, we aim to grow a large community of users to assist in locating delinquent
vehicles on the road faster than has ever before been possible. We will do this by offering
license plate scanning and recognition software through the Repo Coin mobile app,
which will decentralize the process of locating assets that need to be recovered. When a
user scans a license plate it will be matched against our real-time database of delinquent
vehicles. Our users will be incentivized by Repo tokens, which can be used to purchase
goods and services on our website (repocoin.io).

In order to make this possible we
aim to forge partnerships with
lending entities and repossession
companies in every local area across
the US. Our goal is to create the
most comprehensive real-time
database of delinquent vehicles in
existence, with data provided by the

C
q Sy <&, lenders in our network.

We believe that our end-to-end technology offering will be the solution to many prob-
lems in the repossession industry, which have come from the growing need for reposses-
sion services, the inefficiency in communication practices between lenders and reposses-
sion companies, and the high cost of the license plate recognition technology currently
in use.

There are currently no other blockchain platforms looking to decentralize the auto repos-
session space, giving Repo Coin a first-mover advantage.

Our team is composed of innovative minds in the technology sector, located in Chicago
and across the US. We also bring years of experience in the auto repossession sector.

Repo Coin’s blockchain platform will run on the Stellar network, chosen because it is fast,
reliable, and can support inexpensive transactions for many users.

INTRODUCTION —™&

l or @

DEEPONION is referred to as a
hybrid cryptocurrency as it imple-
ments the x13 proof of work (POW)
and the proof of stake (POS) algo-
rithm. The Onion Router (TOR) proto-
col is implemented and integrated
natively within the TOR [2] network.
This ensures the security and
anonymity of all peer-to-peer
connections.

The primary purpose of DeepOnion
s to protect the privacy and identity
of an individual by creating a
payment platform that is instanta-
neous, scalable, secure, anony-
mous and untraceable.

Latest TOR Integration

DeepOnion minimizes the likeli-
hood of identification by both legal
and illegal entities to promote the
anonymity and privacy of cryptocur-
rency users by _ incorporating
anonymity-centric networking proto-
cols and industry-leading cryptogra-
phy.

DeepOnion also seeks to imple-
ment DeepSend and other innova-
tive and proven blockchain technol-
ogies such as Stealth Addresses,
which would make it difficult to
violate our users’ privacy.

Untraceable Payments

DeepOnion,
a privacy focused
cryptocurrency.

ir IP and location

We believe privacy is a right. DeepOnion allows users to
send untraceable payments with ease. Integrated with the

latest TOR, OBFS4, and Meek for maximum privacy.

DeepSend is our hidden paymen
echnology that was _— primarily
designed to protect the senders
identity and obfuscate paymen
ransactions.

With the implementation of many
ayers of security such as Stealth
Addresses, a technology that safe-
guards the identity of the receiver,
he TOR protocol was_ natively
integrated to ensure that all the
connections within the DeepOnion
are protected. DeepSend also
offers security and anonymity o
transactions as mentioned earlier.

DeepOnion makes the balanced
research or tracing of the coin move-
ment impossible throughout the
DeepOnion network or even with
social engineering. The primary aim
of DeepOnion is to offer an anony-
mous platform that operates over a
secure and private network.

Cryptocurrency users can nowtrans-
fer their wealth freely without obser-
vation and scrutiny by legal authori-
ties and malicious attackers.
DeepOnion's

Future Vision

DeepOnion seeks to become a premier hybrid cryptocurrency that guaran-
tees privacy and anonymity of its users by introducing the novel blockchain
technologies and improving the current state-of-the-art. The development
has integrated the latest privacy standards into DeepOnion's technology
stack. The latest TOR protocol was incorporated to ensure that the finances
of our community members remain anonymous and secure in every aspect.
We have gone an extra mile by adding VoteCentral, a voting mechanism that
allows democratic and anonymous representation of the future development

of DeepOnion.

It is our belief that nobody should
have their finances or identity scruti-
nized by financial authorities,
Government entities or any other
individual or group because privacy
is an inherent right. We are working
to offer the latest technology that
will protect the user’s privacy.

Security technologies are dynamic
and because they evolve over time,
we include a variety of actual tech-
nologies that would make it difficult
for both legal and illegal parties to
invade the security of DeepOnion
users.

it becomes very difficult for anyone
oO breach the walls of privacy
because of our massive protocols in
our network.

This has been facilitated through
he integration of the blockchain
echnology that operates on the
DeepOnion network. DeepOnion is
always under constant develop-
ment since it is an evolving project
hat attempts to meet the dynamic
demands on privacy, security, and
echnology to maintain a competi-
ive edge of the advancement in
cryptocurrency.

The essential element is that DeepOnion is a community; a family that
believes in financial obfuscation and online privacy. The critical component
to achieving success in DeepOnion project is having a core community and
we take pride in the thousands of people who promote and support us in
such a short period of time. We become stronger when we work together and

together, we are DeepOnion.

CURRENT PROBLEMS
IN CRYPTOCURRENCY

Currently, Bitcoin (BTC) is the dominant cryptocurrency with a market share

and a market cap of 37.6% and $368 billion respectively, despite the fact that
it is experiencing inherent flaws. Most fears in the crypto-world are not only
exacerbated by wild price fluctuations, but also lack of security and privacy
of the crypto-investors. Our point of the argument lies in the elaboration of
what is lacking in Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum,
Litecoin, and Ripple, and how DeepOnion seeks to solve these issues.

Privacy and
anonymity

Bitcoin [1] is built upon an immutable blockchain, SHA-256 bit encrypted that
is publicly available and distributed over a decentralized network supported
by wallet users and miners. In situations where a human identity is linked to
a wallet address through a commercial vendor or a crypto exchange, it is
compromised irrevocably with regards to privacy. The anonymity of a user
can never be retrieved without generation of a new one and loss of the
remaining BTC linked to the same address. This can be compared to having
a public record of your bank statement indicating all available transactions
that can be seen by everyone.

We witness the empirical demonstration of this phenomenon in an event
where an individual considers exchanging Bitcoin into the FIAT currency
through an online exchange and vice versa. It is possible to conceptualize a
typical scenario as:

An account with the exchange is created by the user who registers his or
her personal details that would facilitate the currency exchange.

An exchange generates the BTC address which is connected to your
personal identity.

The funds are sent by the user from their FIAT bank account (or BTC
wallet) to their identity verified exchange wallet.

A trade is then performed by the user

Unfortunately, the outcome of the above process is that your BTC address
that was once anonymous is now linked irrevocably to your personal identi-
ty. This implies that the exchange is in a position to exactly verify the number
of BTC you have in all the addresses (i.e. your newly created address and
your once anonymous BTC address). Furthermore, they can verify to whom
you are receiving or sending BTC.

In circumstances where the BTC is required to share the details of their
customers to Government bodies or law enforcement agencies, then they
also get to know your identity as well as the number of BTC you have in your
wallet. The same applies to the addresses of the persons you have been
interacting with over the past transactions.

The recent Wannacry ransomware [10] outbreak that saw millions of comput-
er systems infected throughout the world is one of the empirical demonstra-
tions of the ability to track this blockchain. The ransom demanded to decrypt
the files of an infected machine requested in BTC which made the wallet
address public and also available for tracking. It became increasingly
difficult in the following months for the responsible group to exchange their
BTC for the FIAT currency because the BTC could be tracked within the block-
chain every time it moved to another wallet. Given that this was a criminal
act, many would argue that it is a positive feature but let's consider the follow-

ing scenario which was perfectly legal.

Anonymity

Another area of weakness for BTC is anonymity since node traffic is often
sent in a fashion that is unencrypted. The peer addresses of BTC are clearly

Some of the potential risks involved

include the ability to link the user's

disclosing further the coin holder's
identity. This could result in an intelli-
gence-based attack that is more
sophisticated.

Scalabilit
and Spee

BTC demands that all previous blocks within the blockchain are verified cryp-
ographically by all nodes on the network. This requires significant storage
space and computing power in regards to the blockchain size (due to the
number of transactions and age of BTC). It also requires a significant amount
of time that would allow processing of the entire chain. BTC solely relies on
he SHA-256 based x13 proof of work (POW) to mint new coins and process
blocks.

There is also a speed limit on how the transaction takes place which is
proportionate to the difficulty currently configured by the design. A single
b
(e)

ock at present has a high degree of variability and has a confirmation time
350 minutes. Most services often require a minimum of 6 confirmations for
verification. This means that to send or receive a payment, you are likely to
spend at least 35 hours which rules it out as a perfect payment system in the
modern world.

A Misleading
Market Cap

The market cap for digital currencies can be misleading in cases where units
that were included in the calculation of the market cap are not easily avail-
able for trade. The Auroracoin is the best example of a digital currency with
an inflated market cap. It was reported to have a market cap of more than $1
billion but in reality, the bigger portion wasn’t available for anyone.

Another asset that has been accused of overvaluation is the XRP token of
Ripple because the vast majority of the XRP in existence was owned by the
company. DeepOnion attempts to solve the problem of misleading market-
ing cap as we share openly the number of ONIONs mineable to by the
public. 18 million ONIONSs will be distributed freely via airdrop to the communi-
ty. This forms about 90% that have been set to be premined in the genesis
block while 2 million ONIONs is the number that will be mineable by the
public.

Cost of |
Transaction

Some cryptos including Bitcoin and Ethereum might be the leading in the
industry but are too slow when it comes to processing for everyday commer-
cial use. For instance, Bitcoin miners can handle 3 to 7 transactions per
second compared to the visa which has the ability to process over 24,000
during the same period. The resources required to verify transactions in
Bitcoin and Ethereum are at times cost-prohibitive. BTC produces a transac-
tion fee that sums up to $25 during the peak periods. This renders it unfit for
performing cheaper or affordable transactions compared to the latest boom-
ing cryptocurrencies such as DeepOnion.
DEEPONION'S
VISION

DeepOnion has a solution to most of these problems since a myriad of tech-
nologies has been integrated into the core stack. The TOR network controls
the entire network (see 6.1) which makes it very difficult to ascertain the identi-
ty of a user without compromising huge segments of the TOR network. This is
a process that can be interfered with further with the use of VPN (Virtual
Private Network) solutions. This implies that the geographical position of a
DeepOnion user is almost impossible to identify or locate.

On the other hand, there is no
encryption on the BTC traffic which
is the specific rationale behind prop-
osition of the BIP 151. This allows an
IP address linked to the BTC
network to be determined by
packet snooping. In _— situations
where BTC is illegal in your coun-
try's jurisdiction, it could lead to
legal ramifications.

Furthermore, it shows that you are
using BTC and discloses the people
you are connecting to. This is infor-
mation every user would choose
not to disclose or keep away from
the eyes of the public.
DeepOnion will adopt various industry-leading standards from the field of
network security and cryptography to offer security at multiple levels. The
diagram below highlights our multi-layered approach to anonymity and security:

edge proofs) in our roadmap to
obfuscate the traces of ONION

sender. However, we_ provide

evidence for the occurrence of the
ransactions. The origins of a trans-
action will be hidden further when
we implement our DeepSend tech-
nology, based on multi-signatures

system.

The final stage of anonymity and
security is offered by the applica-
tion layer through the adoption of
services such as marketplaces,
decentralized exchanges and other
services that only operate in a
manner that is anonymous, decen-
tralized, secure and cryptographi-
cally verified. These measures will
ensure that the multi-layered
platform gives the absolute best
privacy.

(The confirmation of all details will
be provided at a later date).

The Roadmap
of DeepOnion

The DeepOnion Roadmap as illustrated in (Fig.2) gives a great overview of
features that are yet to be implemented within the project and their estimated
period of implementation. Although it is our endeavor to keep up with these
deadlines, it is not unpopular for a project of this scope and magnitude to
slip. To mitigate these risks effectively, we came up with contingency plans
and hiring of additional members of our development team when necessary.
All delays will be disclosed publicly in any event that it occurs.

Specification

As we mentioned earlier, DeepOnion is a hybrid cryptocurrency with the PoS
and PoW algorithms. Its emission model is recorded at 25 million ONIONS in
more than 10 years. Here is the detailed elaboration of the specifications
mentioned above;

5 confirmations per transaction

50 confirmations per block minted

8 million ONIONS will be distributed freely via airdrop to the community.
This forms about 90% that are set to be premined in the genesis block.
The number that will be mineable by the public is 2 million ONIONs.
RPC Port: 18580 — Connection port: 17570.

Proof of Work (POW)

Proof of Work is a protocol that aims at preventing cyber-attacks that could
result in multiple fake requests by exhausting the resources of a computer
system. It is a concept that has been around even before Bitcoin came into
existence. Proof of Work is ad requirement that that defines an expensive com-
puter calculation well known as ‘mining’. It serves to verify the legitimacy of
transactions as well as avoiding double-spending. It also aims at creating
new digital currencies by offering rewards to miners for the previous tasks
performed.

Features;

X13 algorithm

8 ONION per block will be the initial payout

240s block target

Difficulty retargeting each block

The payout of the POW will be halved each year until where it remains 1
ONION.

Proof of Stake (POS)

Proof of Stake is a different way of validating transactions while achieving a
distributed consensus. Although it serves the same purpose as the Proof of
Work, it uses a different process to complete its task. There is no block
reward in the PoS system and thus the transaction fees are taken by the
miners. One of the biggest advantages of using the proof of stake is that it
has a high energy efficiency compared to the proof of work.

Features;

60s block target

Difficulty in retargeting each block

The interest of PoS will be variable per year:

10% 1st year, 5% the second year and 1% in the subsequent years.
24 hours minimum holding time before the generation of PoS.
Why is Proof of Stake more preferred?

t doesn’t require high electricity consumption to keep the blockchain
secure.

it is not necessary to issue very many coins to motivate participation of
users in the network because of the lack of high electricity consumption.

Proof of stake allows for a wider range of techniques that deter central-
ized cartels from arising using game-theoretic mechanism.

t has reduced risks of centralization because the economies of scale are
not a major issue.

A lot of money is required to attack the system because they will have to
allocate a sizeable amount of money when planning an attack. They
tend to suffer the attack even if they collect a sizeable amount of money
because they will have upset the stability of cryptocurrencies.

x 13 Algorithms

Just as the name suggests, the x13 algorithm utilizes 13 rounds of hashing in
combination with other 13 different hash-functions (This includes prominent
names such as bmw, Blake, jh, skein, groestl, cube-hash, keccak, and Luffa.)
All these make it the most secure algorithms in the cryptography of the
modern era. This algorithm benefits from a high level of flexibility to allow for
the selection of specific hash functions.

It is an added advantage because the adoption of new algorithms can be
done in light of collisions [13] that have been identified in a particular algo-
rithm. 13 hashing functions by its very nature are inherently more secure com-
pared to the SHA-256, a traditional single algorithm used by BTC.

Emission Model

The DeepOnion's emission specification is as follows;

240 seconds PoW block target; which translates to 15 blocks in an hour
and 360 blocks in a day.

nitially, 8 ONION is comprised in every block.
This is a payout that halves each year and thus the number of PoW coins
hat are minable will be:
365 x 360 x 8x (1+%+%+1/8 +...) = 2,102,400
Therefore 2,102,400 will be the total number of PoW coins (This includes
the 18 million that were pre-mined at block 1).

+

The generation of PoS usually occurs at 10% during the initial year. The
second year will be 5% and all the subsequent years will be at 1%. It is
estimated that the total number of ONIONs generated over the space of 10
years will be 25 million approximately.

Network Model

DeepOnion's network is founded upon the TOR network which provides a
method of transaction that is anonymous and highly secured. The users of

DeepOnion usually communicate via the
jzfd.onion. These onion addresses are

TOR addresses, e.g. bb3ebyhgfkj3-
usually self-authenticated which

implies that the address itself gives a cryptographic proof of the service identi-

ty. This, in turn, prevents attackers from sp:

oofing the address. There is a multi-

tude of security benefits that arise when the TOR is integrated into the stack

of DeepOnion's technologies. It includes;

you connect to.

Tamper-proofing through encryption
integrity.

Distribution

Additional privacy on the device that stored the DeepOnion wallet (Your
P becomes untraceable and anonymous).
Cryptographic verification that affirms the genuineness of the network

Freedom from network surveillance and oversight
The impossibility for your client being blocked by a particular address.

and enhanced communications

It is crucial for a new cryptocurrency to have a fair distribution when looking
for mainstream adoption. DeepOnion seeks to meet this requirement by offer-

ing an additional bounty programme as
contains the specifics of the airdrop].

The reasoning behind this tech-
nique is that most people fold. The
holding of the coin can be empha-
sized with a 40-week airdrop
because owners who have
received their airdrop previously
gain trust in the distribution model.
This makes them wait until comple-
ion so that their accumulation can
be maximized.

well as free airdrops. [Appendix A

The future rewards are offered by
the PoS for people who are ready to
hold. New users are getting prime
opportunity to participate due to the
longevity of the campaign which
boosts the number of DeepOnion
users within the community who are
holding ONIONS. A tapered emis-
sion of the distribution of airdrops
ensures that the number of
airdropped coins increases as the
number of participants also grows
[See Appendix A].

The holding of a large number of ONION occurs within the bounty wallets
and development to be utilized when additional recruitment becomes neces-
sary. It can either be as an extra developer venture or as an advertisement.
The collection of bounties is done voluntarily when the community members
complete goals that have been set by the development team.
Distribution

This distribution model received initial criticism which hypothesizes a situa-
tion where a Developer dumps their coins after meeting a critical price. How-
ever, it is necessary to put emphasis on the method in which the risk is mitigat-
ed.

+ 2million ONION is held by the founding members of DeepOnion. Its
percentage of the overall ONIONs distributed lies within the successive
airdrop of each week (airdrop completed at the time ofwriting).

+ There is a low current volume that prevents a scenario where ‘dump-

ing’occurs. The airdrop distribution method facilitates holding which in

turn leads to low numbers of ONION during a particular exchange.

This is an open-source project (excluding the currently secured Deep-

Vault that is yet to be released in due course). There will be a possibility

of working with minimal disruption given the skill set and size within the

community.

he work ethic of the development team is categorically denied by a

dump of this nature and the same applies to the future vision of DeepOn-

ion’s ecosystem.

Community

The strength of DeepOnion lies in reputation and support of its massive com-
munity network. Most cryptocurrencies usually fall short of the mainstream
adoption because of their lackluster promotion and small user base. We
understand clearly how essential the social aspect can be from the time of
inception since the formation of the community is done with utmost impor-
tance. Furthermore, we introduced a voting platform to ensure that the future

of the project can be shaped by DeepOnion users.

Stealth Addresses

The DeepOnion Development team
has taken the level of privacy to the
next level by introducing Stealth
Addresses. As the name suggests
Stealth Addresses are used to
create an address that cannot be
traced by the regular explorers
because it protects the privacy of
the one receiving the payments.
The sender and the receiver are the
only sole parties that will be aware
of the true identity of each other
(and just for the sender, because
next time it will create another
unique address).

However, no other third parties to
he transaction will have a_ hint
about what transpired. DeepSend
has created a way of splitting the
ransaction into random nodes that
would make it very difficult to trace
he sender. This can only happen
when all the transactions are com-
pletely untraceable.

To understand more about the stealth addresses, let&#39;s consider the

following scenario;

+ The recipient generates a key pair (private/public )
+ The recipient then allows everyone to know more about the Stealth

Address (Public key) but keeps
he private one secret.

+ The sender takes the public key or the &quot;Stealth Address&quot; and

address&quot; — so cool, right?

hen adds a random value to it so that it can generate a &quot;normal

ext, they load onions into this address.

+ The sender encrypts the private key (the &quot;random number&quot;

possess the private key).

from above) together with the normal address and puts this data into the
blockchain (all this data appears as gibberish to other clients who do not

+ The recipient then uses his private key to decrypt the data and voila — he
gains access to the normal address as well as the ONIONs.
Benefits of stealth addresses

+ They add more safety, trust, and privacy to the users.

+ The destination of where a payment was sent can only be concluded by
the sender and the receiver

+ No third party will be aware of any payments or transactions that you
received from other people.

+ The blockchain cannot make a correlation because you send and
receive payments using separate and unique addresses.

+ Since no third party is involved in the transaction, they won’t know
anything about the payments more so if there is no direct communication
between the receiver and the sender.

Atomic Swaps

Atomic swap is another upcoming
feature that doesn’t require a trust-
ed third party when exchanging one
cryptocurrency for another. Trusted
third parties used to be a necessity
in the traditional cryptocurrencies
when performing a cryptocurrency
exchange. This was done to prevent
one party from losing part of their
currency without receiving another
currency in return.

From a theoretical point of view, the Atomic Swaps would create a solution
for the need of a decentralized exchange. Although scalability may be a
concern, the development team is working hard enough to ensure that every-
thing is put into consideration to allow for more privacy when implementing
this technology.

Smart Contracts

The support of Smart Contracts is another feature that DeepOnion plans to
have in the near future. The smart contract is hash time-locked and used by
the atomic swap system so that the currency you need to swap can be deliv-
ered within a particular duration; otherwise, it is likely to be canceled. This is
done to preserve the atomicity for the swap to occur or none of the currency
will be swapped.
Smart Contracts

This is the pacesetter to all the oncoming DeepOnion applications as they
are programs that execute what they were intended to perform. The reason-
ing behind DeepOnion coming up with the “Self-executing contracts” is to
allow normal contracts between individuals to be converted into computer
codes. The same version is then stored before being replicated on the
system that is supervised by a computer network operating the blockchain.
The outcome is a physical exchange of a value referred as the ledger feed-
back. This entails receipt of goods and services or transfer of funds.

If you find it difficult to understand the concept of smart contracts, Nick Szabo
illustrates it as a vending machine-— the first person to conceive the idea of
the smart contracts. Basically, you would put some token in the vending
machine for a snack or a cup of coffee. In this situation, we treat the token as
the cryptocurrency. This means that their parties involved in the contract
would have to meet certain conditions before they can execute the contract.
The application of smart contracts can be done as multi- accounts that would
demand a certain number of people to agree for a particular action to be
performed. Also, it can be used in managing agreements between parties to
a contract before the application details can be stored.

DeepOnion seeks to address the
inherent loopholes of traditiona
crypto coins such as Ether and BTC.
A typical example is an attack on
The DAO (Ethereum-based smart
contract), where a hacker carted
away a sum of $50 million in Ether.
DeepOnion is rolling out its plans on
the smart contract where we wil
have an anonymous (Tor-based
self-executing contract that tops in
the crypto space. This will be
promoted largely by the TOR
network ensuring that all details
about contracts will be visible to all
involved parties. It helps shut down
all forms of prying eyes as well as
the third parties.

DeepOnion smart contracts are
definitely something that our com-
munity will be looking forward to
despite the uncertainties surround-
ing this upcoming technology. It can
be visualized in terms of when the
development is scheduled to begin
as well as the implementing code. It
should act as a motivating factor for
people who want to invest in Deep-
Onion because it will certainly take
the crypto-world by storm.

Lightning Network

Basically, the lightning is a decentralized network that enables instant
payments across a wide network of participants using the smart contract func-
tionality. Our development team is currently working towards implementing
the lightning network that depends exclusively on the underlying technology
used in the blockchain. It is possible to generate a secure network of partici-
pants transacting at high speed and high volume using real DeepOnion or
blockchain transactions. It will be backed up by the native scripting language

for the smart contract.

How it works

A ledger entry is created on the blockchain by two participants demanding
both of them to sign off any spending of funds (Bidirectional Payment Chan-
nels). They go ahead to create transactions that reimburse the ledger entry
to their discrete allocation but cannot be broadcasted to the blockchain.

Their individual allocations for the ledger entry can be updated by creating
many transactions spending from the latest output of the ledger entry. The
most recent version is the one that will be regarded as valid and will be
enforced by smart-contract scripting that is blockchain-parsable. Either party

across the network by creating a
network of the two-party ledger
entries. A script is used to enforce

has the authority of closing out the entry at any time without any custodian-
ship or trust by broadcasting the latest blockchain version.

This results in the possibility of
conducting transactions that are

to be made off-chain with a lot of
confidence. This can be compared
to how an individual carries ou
legal contracts with others. Howev-
er, no person shows up in cour
every time they make a contract.
The smart contract can be enforced
on-blockchain by making the scripts
and transactions parsable. The
court is usually involved in the even
of non-cooperation but the result is
deterministic when it comes to the
blockchain.

Features of the Future
Transactions Using
Smart Contracts

Instant Payments

No need to worry about the block confirmation times because of the light-
ning-fast blockchain payments. The blockchain smart-contracts enforce secu-
rity without creating on-blockchain payments for individual transactions. The
speed of payments is measured in milliseconds to seconds.

Low Cost

The lightning network exceptionally allows for low fees by settling off-block-
chain and transactions. This allows for instant micropayments and other
emerging use cases.

Scalability

It will have the ability to have millions of transactions per second across the
entire network. Legacy payment rails are blown away by capacity as a result
of many orders of magnitude. It will be possible to attach payment per click
without the need of custodians.

Cross Blockchain

The heterogeneous blockchain consensus rules can result in cross-chain
atomic swaps occurring off- chain. There is a high possibility of making trans-
actions across blockchain without putting trust in the third party custodians.

DeepOnion Marketplace

DeepOnion will have its own marketplace where visitors will be able to buy
products or services with ONION payment method. This will be a
game-changer as we will charge no extra fees and sellers will be protected
from chargebacks and other scams. This marketplace will be similar to
Fiverr.com but only accept ONION as payment method. Our main priority is to
protect the privacy of our users and this marketplace will be no exception.

DeepOnion Academy

o the DeepOnion Academy videos.

The market used to be dirty
garbage that would pump dump
people while the cryptos were heav-
ily abused by the short income
dreamers. It is only through this
education that people can end the
problems and challenges they face
rom other leading cryptocurren-
cies. All crimes that were committed
against cryptos including abuses
and lies all happened because of
ack of education about the indus-
ry. Most people usually hate what
hey don’t understand and that is
why DeepOnion saw it wise to offer
skills and guidance in whichever
way possible to counter negativity
of cryptocurrencies.

DeepOnion Academy plans to inspire and create the first step to include new
people and eliminate any barrier that can generate a disruptive and
world-changing technology as the blockchain. The Academy videos are
aimed at educating the masses by increasing general awareness and expan-
sion for the crypto communities. It gives them the ability to reach new people
hrough the simplest videos that have ever been done since Bitcoin came into
existence. People can now understand more about the crypto world, thanks

The education project would be the
greatest gift for the crypto world
since we foster peace among our
members and the entire DeepOnion
community. We don’t look forward
to carrying wars, kill more people or
enslave Africa and other weak coun-
tries but to recognize them as
important individuals who deserve
more dignity and respect in the
society and the word as a whole.
We set an example and we expect
even a better approach from future
education projects during the adop-
tion and expansion of DeepOnion to
any public.

EXAMINATION OF
TECHNOLOGIES

The strength of DeepOnion rests in its multi-faceted approach to privacy and
security which are manifested by the myriad of technologies that have been
incorporated in its wallet and blockchain. DeepOnion has integrated a
number of common technologies that are also present in other currencies (we
adopt the current best practice). It also boasts several proprietary solutions

that offer additional anonymity, security, and privacy as well as further the
state-of-the-art.

It is necessary to understand the common technologies that are shared by
all blockchain cryptocurrencies to discuss this further.
Blockchain

We can effectively define a blockchain as “continuous list of records that
keeps growing” also referred to as blocks are linked and secured using cryp-
tography. Every block incorporates a hash pointer that links to the previous
block, transaction data and a timestamp. The blockchain is inherently resis-
tant to data modification [3] by design.

One of the effective solutions to most problems that face the existing financial
systems is utilizing a blockchain in a currency. An immutable public ledger is
provided by the blockchain, comprising of all transactions that have trans-
pired in the entirety of the network. This enables verification of any transac-
tions because the inception of the coin (with the privacy trade-offs that have
been described in 2.1), which makes it a simple task in the resolution of
conflicts.

Blockchain Scalability

It is essential to understand the concept of throughput because the block-
chain is considered to be a continuous ledger that accounts for all transac-
ions. The maximum throughput of Bitcoin is 4 transactions per second while
hat of Ethereum is 7 transactions per second. The reason for this limitation is
due to the amount of stored data in the blocks (block size) — records of trans-
actions that can be stored in every fixed block size i.e. 1 MB, and the average
ime taken to process the hash of a block before it is added to the blockchain
(block time). This can result in BTC transactions being completed in more than
24 hours. This is a fundamental flaw in a payment system that was supposed
© be instantaneous. This situation has been improved by DeepOnion as
many folds by integrating the PoS, faster blocktimes and larger blocksizes.
This leads to a theoretical throughput of 62.5 transactions per second,
detailed as follows;

The average size of the transaction is about 500 Butes. The block
size of DeepOnion is 1.5 MB which means that each block has the
ability to hold approximately 3000 transactions.

DeepOnion is a hybrid coin, mixed with PoW/PoS. On average, the
PoV interval is 240 seconds but the target of PoS is a lot more
frequent at 60 seconds. This implies that our theoretically com-
bined block time is 48 seconds, illustrated as (240/5).

Blockchain Scalability

For verification, we checked the blocks for the last 24 hours and this is what

we get:

« Block 223460 occurs at 11:59:36 AM on 25th Nov 2017
« Block 225285 occurs at 11:59:05 AM on 26th, Nov 2017

This means;

In 24 hours, we have 1825 blocks which means that our average
block time is set at 47 seconds, matching our designed target

block time.

We have one block per 48 seconds with the ability to handle 3000
[4| transactions. This implies that DeepOnion is capable of handling a

maximum transaction rate of;

3000/48 = 62.5 tx/second.

This is almost 10 times of Ethereum’s
throughput is more — suitable,
scalable and effective for mass
adoption as a cryptocurrency.

The transaction speed of DeepOn-
ion can be increased further by the
future implementation of the light-
ning network technology [8]. If not
faster, this could lead to the same
speed of transaction, compared to
the VISA network (approximately 56
k/sec). DeepOnion will be the
perfect payment platform due to the
fast speeds in combination with the
anonymity of the Tor network.

Cryptocurrency

A ccryptocurrency is a digital asset that secures its transactions using cryptog-
raphy and was designed to operate as a medium of exchange. It also verifies
the transfer of assets [4] and controls the creation of additional units. Bitcoin
was released in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto as the first decentralized crypto-

currency.
Decentralization

Decentralization is the process of dispersing or distributing powers, functions,
people, or things away from the authority or central location [5].

In regards to the crypto world, decentralization can be defined as the elimina-
tion of a central processing authority (much like the VISA). Every node on the
network, (a miner or typically wallet) is verified independently through a
process of cryptographic hashing functions with every block within the block-

chain.

This approach has the advantage of
increasing the security levels on the
network and reducing the reliance
of putting trust on the payment
processor. You would have to com-
promise at least 51% of the network
o interfere with the process. Proba-
bly, this might not have been feasi-
ble given the different operating
systems and protocols as well as
he global distribution of nodes.
Every node has the ability to verify
new block which benefits the
network. DeepOnion introduces the
PoS, taking this step further than
BTC which gives another form of
verification and mining. This leads
o the necessity of having to compro-
mise a larger share of the network
across two channels which is effec-
ively impossible.

Although the verification of each
transaction has maximum security, it
also explains the reason why trans-
actions usually take a long time
compared to the traditional meth-
ods of payment. The lightning
network is one of the technologies
that offers an approach to solving
this option of scaling. However, you
will be reducing the security which
reduces the number of verifications
every time transactions are taken
off the core. A complex problem is
determining the number of confirma-
tions or security required and one

that currently is the focus of various
projects such as Ethereum and BTC.

DEEPONION
INNOVATION
TECHNOLOGIES

In section 5, we defined the commonalities behind all cryptocurrencies. It is
also important to introduce the novel blockchain technologies that will be
implemented by DeepOnion to meet the dynamic demands in the crypto-
sphere. This involves the necessity to improve anonymity and _ privacy
beyond current efforts.

DeepOnion is an anonymous coin with stealth transactions that will use an
improved version of SuperSend coin mixing processes. The sections below
will detail the novel blockchain implementations of DeepOnion and the
reason why they were selected.
TOR

Tor can be defined as a communication service that is anonymous, has a low
latency, and is based on a circuit. The original design has limitations which
are addressed by the Onion Routing System of the second generation
through the addition of directory servers, exit policies that are configurable, a
practical design for services, an ideal forward secrecy, integrity checking,
and congestion control with a hidden location through points that are rendez-
vous. Tor requires no kernel modifications or special privileges because it
works on the internet of the real world. It requires little coordination and
synchronizations between nodes. Furthermore, it also provides a reasonable
tradeoff between efficiency, anonymity, and usability [2].

This provides an ideal platform
where to build an anonymous cryp-
tocurrency. The idea of proof of
stake was also precisely decided to
create a safer and stable TOR
network. With the mass adoption of
DeepOnion, the TOR network can
expand to new levels helping to
create a powerful network that will
make it difficult for any person to
analyze the network traffic. The
TOR network will also include new

relay codes with any DeepOnion
wallet that connects into the Deep-
Onion etwork. Therefore, the
better the adoption of DeepOnion,
the safer the TOR network and both
technologies can benefit from each
other.

The TOR network is an open source
project that has undoubtedly bad
rame around the world since media
exploits any resource to sell regard-
ess of whether they are totally
biased. Actually, the TOR network is
he best way for many people to be
heard in countries where there is a
otal censorship or means to report
criminal activities for journalists or
whistleblowers that cannot resign to
heir privacy for obvious reasons.

The new digital era is making clear that privacy is no longer something that
we have. This is because the new gold for them is our personal information,
without mentioning the number of vulnerabilities that exist in common
networks — vulnerabilities that can be abused by any criminal. DeepOnion
believes that the TOR Network should be used as a default or at least our
privacy on the internet should be something that we can’t resign. It is essen-
tial that we defend our privacy before it becomes too late.

Currently, DeepOnion is upgrading to the latest 0.3 protocol that will intro-
duce the latest anonymous features to our wallet that are most secure to
protect our users. It is also essential to emphasize that all connections arising
from the DeepOnion wallet are usually made over the Tor network. Your
public IP address can never be exposed at any point.

DeepSend

DeepSend is a side transaction security feature that was designed to hide
traces of transactions within the blockchain (a problem identified earlier with
BTC). This is distinctively different from the integration of our TOR that anony-
mises and secures the network traffic at the transport layer. A number of tech-
nologies that are comprised in DeepSend include;

+ The Zero Knowledge technologies by Zerocoin and Zerocash such as
ZCoin and Zcash

+ CoinJoin technologies either with the random mixers (e.g. Supercoin and
Dash) or with the centralized mixers (e.g. masternodes).

« CryptoNote’s Ring Signature such as Monero and Buytecoin.

Each technology comes with its own advantages and disadvantages. For
instance, you must mint and burn new coins that are unrecognizable in
Zero-Knowledge technologies since it would require an additional amount of
space in the blockchain. Currently, DeepSend is programmed to become a
CoinJoin and Mixer technology that is based on multi-signature technologies
that are trustless. Therefore, they offer a competitive edge of privacy and
anonymity. In order to conceptualize this idea, think of the following scenario;

Person A wants to pay $x amount of money to Person B

If Person A chose to make direct payments to Person B, then the

transaction would be publicly disclosed to all (the current situation

in BTC). On the contrary, Person A will pay Person C who goes
ahead to pay Person D. After iterations, Person Z then pays the
amount to Person B.

This implies that multi-signatures guarantee all payments that
3 | were done by both Person A and B, and neither of these address-
es is connected to individuals.

The main reasoning behind this is that Person B gives money to

[4| Person C who later pays it to Person D with a different address that
is unrelated. Given enough iterations, it makes it very difficult to
reverse traces of the transaction.

DeepVault

DeepVault allows members of DeepOnion to store hashes of files (file valida-
tion credentials) within the blockchain. In other terms, it is a store o
immutable information held within the blockchain that allows members to
verify the integrity of a file over time. Therefore, you will know that the file has
been corrupted or altered when the hashes of file changes. This tool will also
be invaluable in determining whether your essential documents have no
been tampered with and that they are secure. An obvious use for this feature
is legal documents as it allows the verification of this document by the inter-
ested parties, hence the content will not be altered erroneously, maliciously
or through file corruption without the consent of the person. Consider this an
expansion of smart contracts where validations of integrity or conditions are
done through cryptography.

DeepVault is highly intuitive and has been integrated into the DeepOnion
wallet. It is a novel feature that offers a solution to the simple file validation
which has been the major problem. The processes of file verification and
hashing have been improved by DeepVault which provides several benefits
that are simple to use. They are;

+ Generation of the file hashes is done using a GUI that is normally embed-
ded within the wallet.

VoteCentral is a voting platform that is open to all and was founded upon the
blockchain technologies that will allow voting by the DeepOnion community
on the proposals and tasks that have been suggested and submitted by the
community members relating to the future trends of this project. Members will
have a huge impact on the decisions made by the community that influences
the DeepOnion expansion project as well as the direction taken by the devel-
opment team.

modern politics only that it mitigates voting fraud because of the additional
benefits of the blockchain technology. Community suggestions or new direc-
ions can be registered through VoteCentral before being evaluated by the
Airdrop founders, Development team and the holders who have ONION
balances within their wallet that are more than the necessary minimum.

As mentioned earlier, VoteCentral is considered as a layered approach. This
hierarchy can be conceptualized by imagining three concentric circles:

The core, which is the inner circle, consists of our initial founders
and development team.

The surrounding core refers to our airdrop founders who are man-
dated with the right to vote in the VoteCentral.

Lastly, the exterior is comprised of long-term DeepOnion support-
ers, as well as participants who have made massive contributions
towards the DeepOnion project.

Voting is based on a member's status that was granted through long-term
support (or proven contributions to the community). At this point, the voting
power (vote weight) of the member depends on the balance in their ONION
wallets.
VoteCentral

There are two phases of the VoteCentral, which includes a centralized solu-
ion that is supported by the web technologies and the next phase of the
uture that will be supported by the blockchain. This software will be used by
wallet owners to the suggested proposals of the community as well as the

a process of robust analysis and evaluation that is supported by the senti-
ments from our community and weighing in a democratic arena.

We select the best proposals and tasks that are most popular from VoteCen-

Onion project. By proving your commitment to DeepOnion, you play a pivotal
role in our future as you can raise your opinions, which ultimately rewards
you with a higher voting weight within the project. We believe that DeepOnion

E-commerce plugins

Our development team is currently working on producing a number of plugins
where ONIONs can be used as a method of payment. WooCommerce is an
open-source e-commerce plugin that has now been released. It was specifi-
cally designed for WordPress. Over 380,000 online retailers have already

adopted this plugin and are also used by

a number of heavy traffic websites.

There is a large number of users in WooCommerce which makes it ideal for
the currency to be accepted as a method of payment on this platform.
E-commerce plugins

Other plugins being developed include OpenCart and PrestaShop. OpenCart
is an online store management system that supports many different curren-
cies and languages, and it is also freely available. PrestaShop is a premium
open source e-commerce solution available in 60 different languages and
250,000 shops worldwide. Behind all these solutions, DeepOnion will be
making plugins for some of the major e-commerce platforms such as Shopify,
Magento and much more.

Trezor Hardware Wallet
Compatibility using the
Electrum Wallet

Trezor is a single purpose device that allows crypto-investors to make secure
transactions. Transactions remain completely safe despite being initiated on
a vulnerable or compromised computer. We believe that the use of Trezor
hardware wallet compatibility will help DeepOnion adoption among people
who are not familiar with security procedures.

It works when DeepOnion protocol sends signed notes of payment via the
internet. A special algorithm is used to sign the transactions which require a
unique key or password. The key is held in Trezor hardware wallet as it was
specifically designed to help you sign transaction messages securely. Trezor
can be thought of as the modern-day stamp in crypto-world. Every Trezor
comes with its own PIN code which makes it impossible for any person to
access your account. Hackers may compromise the computer where you use
your Trezor but they will never get hold of your key.

Trezor Hardware Wallet
Compatibility using the
Electrum Wallet

DeepOnion will be among the top cryptocurrencies that use Trezor hardware
wallet compatibility to ensure the privacy and anonymity of its users. It
supports Windows 7 and other higher versions as well as Linux and OS X

THE FUTURE OF
DEEPONION

DeepOnion takes pride in 2017 as a tremendously successful year for the
development team and the members of the community. We are one of the
most popular forum threads you can find on BitcoinTalk.org and have done
that in a period of more than 6 months as a community. We have visualized a
strong growth on our forums of approximately 14,000 members with strong
mining that will support our blockchain. 2018 is set to be the year of breaking
records following the recent expansion of our development team and our

current roadmap.

We are contacted by major inves-
ors and exchanges on a daily basis
or listing while the prominent
crypto celebrities wish to take part
in the DeepOnion project. We are
humbled to see that all the hard
work from the Development team
and members of our community is
yielding results. Our development
eam is currently working on the
Electrum Wallet and ledger compati-
bility and the main DeepOnion
Wallet will soon have different style
hemes.

It is essential to emphasize that we
will soldier on until DeepOnion
becomes the adopted de-facto
privacy cryptocurrency. Our
exchange listings and trade
volumes continue to grow on a
monthly basis. Our message is
spreading rapidly across the world
as we continue to integrate our
novel blockchain technologies. As
denoted in our roadmap, we
haven’t even begun our advertising
campaign. We are very confident as
the developmentteam that DeepOn-
ion will be propelled to the forefront
of cryptocurrency adoption with a
celebrity endorsement and a fully
implemented roadmap.

2018 will be a year of excitement for members of DeepOnion community.
Here are the features that are to be implemented as mentioned earlier;

« DeepSend

«+ DeepVault Website

+ VoteCentral

+ Mobile Wallet

+ Smart Contracts

« Atomic Swaps

+ Celebrity endorsements
+ Advertising Campaign
+ DeepOnion Academy

Furthermore, 10% of the airdrops will be used for events in the DeepOnion
forum each week to reward any participation at the forum community of Deep-
Onion. The remaining 90% is often airdropped directly.

Bounty Fund: 3,000,000

The balance currently stands at 2,600,000 after the various events, distribu-
tions, bounties, and rewards. This fund is usually channeled to reward contri-
butions such as videos, articles and significant contributions that are benefi-
cial to DeepOnion and members of its community. It will also provide support
to potential new merchants to choose DeepOnion.

Founders reward: 2,000,000

Development fund: 3,000,000

For example, new feature developments and smart contracts. VoteCentral
will determine how these funds are used.

Acknowledgments

The DeepOnion development team would like to appreciate our community
and all participants who have offered us support throughout our journey. This
project has thrived from its roots because of your efforts and involvement.
Although we have the vision and technology, you are the ones who assist us
to distribute this into an ecosystem that is workable. We all benefit from
private and anonymous financial transactions in a world that are increasingly
dominated by the pervasive digital espionage. We highly thank you for your

continued support and we urge you to continue with the same spirit.

The DeepOnion team would also
like to recognize the ongoing work
of their diligent Moderator team
who have achieved massive
success in fulfilling the requirements
of the project as well as the Deep-
Onion community even through the
festive season.

We send a special thank you to the
community members for the provi-
sion of graphics that have been
included in the white paper

DeepOnion is not just something
written on a stone since we can
improve and add more features to
our project. We are evolving all the
time as any other open source
project that includes people from
any part of the world.

Glossary

Whitepaper: It is a report that gives well-documented information or proposals regarding a specif-
ic project (e.g. the DeepOnion Project and upcoming features.)

Proof of Stake (POS) — It is a concept where a person can mine block transactions or validate
them depending on the coins that they hold. This implies that the more ONIONs or altcoin you
own as a miner, the more mining power you will have.

Proof of Work (POW) — This is an economic measure that limits the denial of service abuses or
attacks and requires work from the person requesting the service. It simply refers to the process-
ing time by a computer.

Blockchain- It is the world’s leading software technology that is used to build a better financial
system in cryptocurrencies.

Decentralized — It refers to shifting of departments from one administrative location to other
centers.

Hash -— It involves taking any length of an input string and giving out an output of a specific
length. Transactions are considered to be an input that is run into a hashing algorithm e.g. the
SHA-256 that gives a fixed length of output.

Stake - It is the act of holding a cryptocurrency in your wallet for a fixed period of time to accrue
some interest.

TOR: It can be defined as a communication service that is anonymous and has a low latency
based on a circuit.

Cryptocurrency - It is a digital currency that modulates the creation of currency units and allows
verification of fund transfers using encryption techniques. It doesn’t require intermediation by the
Central bank.

DeepVault - it is a store of immutable information held within the blockchain that allows members
to verify the integrity of a file over time.

DeepSend -— It is a side transaction security feature that was designed to hide traces of transac-
tions within the blockchain.

Privacy — It is the ability of a person to selectively express themselves by secluding any informa-
tion about themselves. DeepOnion is a cryptocurrency that guarantees the privacy of its users.

Anonymity- The quality or state of being unknown to most people: the quality or state of being
anonymous.

PLAYCHIP.

PlayChip: The Universal Gaming Token

A Blockchain Enabled,
Sports Community & Gambling Ecosystem

PlayChip Foundation Ltd.

Sydney, Australia

Version 2.1 August 2018

Abstract

The PlayChip Foundation Ltd is developing its PlayChip to be at the centre of an incentivised, blockchain-
enabled, sports community, and gaming ecosystem. Following the implementation of the blockchain enabled
PlayChip, holders of the PlayChip will be able to seamlessly transfer funds between the various sites accepting
the token through the PlayWallet. They will be able to buy and sell the token directly via our partnered exchange,
the PlayXchange. The PlayChip will also be available to trade on other major international exchanges. This will
provide a degree of control and security in a manner not seen before in online gaming.

The PlayChip is designed to be secure, scalable, and fun, as well as include features to incorporate fairness into
PlayChip transactions and the partner gaming platforms, allowing it to become the gaming token of choice
globally.

PlayChip Foundation Whitepaper

1 Introduction

The PlayChip Ecosystem is being developed to
capitalize on market opportunity characterized by
the following:

e currently no global solution for online
gaming platforms to load and cash out
gaming chips using reliable and timely
methods for transfer to location and
location currency.

e currently no solution for movement of
gambling funds in a transparent manner,
where commissions for gaming and
money movement are clearly recorded.

e currently no crypto blockchain solution
for gaming funds that incorporate trust
and transparency of a blockchain based
technology.

e currently no integration to third party
gaming environs and third-party crypto
exchanges via application programming
interfaces (APIs), and blockchain

technology.

e need for flexibility in global online
gaming to comply with variable regional
gaming regulations.

e need for global online gaming that
utilises crypto tokens to meet various
regional security regulations, and as they
develop.

e currently no solution for uniform KYC
and AML process, and then input as
common set data for backend processes
for jurisdictional regulation.

e currently no solution to utilise token
metadata or Smart Contracts for current
and future regulation applicable to online
gaming.

The goal is to design the PlayChip Ecosystem to
address these market issues and prove global
token of choice for online gaming. The PlayChip
Ecosystem should benefit consumers by
incentivizing longer play, bigger prizes, and

August 2018

better odds. As the Ecosystem is based on crypto
technology it will facilitate instant cash outs and
provide greater trust and transparency in the
holding and movement of funds.

In delivering PlayChip to gamers, the PlayChip
Foundation and partners will benefit by access to
global audiences and greater liquidity. The
development of the Ecosystem, with well-defined
interfaces and operating processes, will lower
operating costs and allow game providers access
to other services such as seamless online
shopping.

2 PlayChip Ecosystem

The PlayChip Ecosystem integrates participants
to enable operation (Figure 2). Each participant is
described below:

e Players — online gamers globally use
their smart device and PlayChip to access
all services offered by the PlayChip
Ecosystem.

e Partner Gaming Platforms — providers of
online gaming experiences integrated
into the PlayChip Ecosystem to provide

PlayChip

additional services to

Ecosystem users.

e Global Crypto Exchanges — partner
global crypto currency exchanges that
allow players and investors to trade
PlayChip Foundation Whitepaper

PlayChips and exchange to local

currency as and when they choose.

e Partner Stores — that offer products or
services to users of the PlayChip
Ecosystem by accepting payment in
PlayChip currency. PlayChip Foundation
will not place any restrictions on other
third-party stores offering goods and
services in exchange for PlayChips,
however they may not be considered
Partner Stores.

The PlayChip Ecosystem is the engine that drives
this innovative gaming platform. The
componentry is described below.

The development of the PlayChip is a natural
progression for the dynamic and ever-evolving
gaming industry. Due to the ‘trustless’ nature of
Smart Contracts, and speed and autonomy of
blockchain networks, it is envisioned that the
majority of industries will adopt a blockchain-
enabled payment system in future. The PlayChip
Ecosystem aims to be at the forefront of change
hence investment in blockchain technology to
drive its solutions.

The choice of public blockchain technology for
the Ecosystem player interface and “off-net”
technology choice for the gaming platform
interface is based primarily on a need for higher
transaction speed in _ backend processes.
Blockchain technology is evolving rapidly,
however not yet ready for a stable backend
solution. Thus, the PlayChip Foundation has
chosen the architecture in Figure 2 for the first
release of the PlayChip Ecosystem.

As blockchain technology transaction speed and
scalability increases then PlayChip Foundation
will reassess ability to include blockchain
technology into the backend systems. This would
be seamless to Players and offers potentially
more insight into the mechanics of the PlayChip
Ecosystems via blockchain explorers.

Figure 3 — PlayChip Ecosystem
The PlayChip Ecosystem combines two separate

common element systems (Figure 3). Those
elements have the following features:

e A system for global transfer of funds
using the PlayChip and
PlayChip wallets, © governed by
cryptocurrency regulations.

common

e A common user account for PlayChip
and gaming environs. Players must have
an active account with tokens to

participate in the PlayChip Ecosystem.

e A regional-aware system that allows
PlayChip Foundation to respect regional
gaming regulations whilst managing

movement under its

control.

As the global system initially utilises Ethereum
blockchain [2], movements of PlayChip in this
system will incur an Ethereum transaction costs
described as GAS. In contrast the PlayChain is
“off-net” and movements of PlayChip within the
PlayChip Ecosystem are free from GAS. This is
a further benefit of the initial technology choice
for the PlayChain, however we expect cost to
improve as Ethereum evolves.

It is envisioned that a Player will only carry out
one ‘Know Your Customer’? (KYC) onboard
PlayChip Foundation Whitepaper

process to satisfy global regulation and Anti-
Money Laundering (AML) regulation. In other
words, the same information is able to satisfy
both gaming and crypto regulatory environs.

2.1 PlayChip

PlayChip is fundamental to the Ecosystem by
providing a virtual currency for trading and
gaming within the Ecosystem. The PlayChip is
based on the Ethereum ERC20 token standard
[3]. Global movements of the PlayChip are
completed with the public Ethereum Blockchain.

Refer to token offering document [1].

2.2 PlayXchange
The PlayXchange is core to movement of tokens
within the Ecosystem. It is optionally enabled to
outside exchanges or directly to currency or
services. The PlayXchange is tightly integrated
into the PlayWallet.

2.3. PlayChain

PlayChain is the backend technology for
immutability, trust, and transaction capability
between gaming platforms, PlayXchange, and the
PlayWallet. The PlayChain tracks movement of
PlayChips within the PlayChip Ecosystem.

2.4 PlayWallet

The PlayWallet contains players PlayChips in a
ready to access and easy to use application on
their smart device. The PlayWallet is integrated
into the gaming platforms.

2.5 Partner Game Platforms

The PlayChip Ecosystem is designed to support
various game platforms and provide common
services with the PlayChip. Currently the game
platforms are either tailored to the local regions
(via regional sports) or global — sports.
Increasingly, platforms are developed based on
fantasy sports [1]. The PlayChip Ecosystem is
game type agnostic however each game platform
must conform to the Ecosystem interface and
meet legal requirements to participate.

2.6 PlayChip Foundation

The PlayChip Foundation is established to
protect and stimulate the PlayChip economy. The
PlayChip Foundation will release a portion of

August 2018

PlayChips for public sale, and grant the residue to
partners, affiliates, founders and advisors, who
will seed the Ecosystem and stimulate growth
where available. The PlayChip Foundation will
operate the PlayXchange. The PlayChip
Foundation will regulate existing coins in the
market to preserve token value. In addition, the
PlayChip Foundation will derive PlayChip
revenue to ensure long-term viability via
activities such as:

e Fees on some PlayXchange transactions,
e Fees for quick cash out facility,

e Interest fees for loaning PlayChips to
new partners in the event they are unable
to buy a pool to operate,

e Optional charge to partner for KYC and
AML check service,

e Standard partnership distribution fees.

PlayChip Foundation transactions will be carried
out on PlayChain or PlayXchange and reported
with the same mechanism as the PlayChip
Ecosystem described later in this document.

3 PlayChip Ecosystem Features

The key features that make for a compelling case
for both Players and game providers to adopt
PlayChip and its Ecosystem are described below.

3.1 Customer KYC

Both the crypto and gaming Ecosystem requires
users to carry out KYC compliance. KYC
compliance costs are increasing due to growing
costs of transaction tracking software, staff
training, and rarity of experts in a rapidly
developing environment.

The PlayChip Ecosystem onboarding process
will be used to unify KYC and AML process
between crypto and gaming Ecosystems.

Customers who have applied for one set of games
already have KYC stored making it easier to enter
new games within the Ecosystem, reducing
barriers to and costs of adoption.

Once the user details are entered, a strong identity
and access mechanism is designed in the
PlayChip Foundation Whitepaper

Ecosystem as a central identity engine to
facilitate ongoing secure use and operation.

3.2
Customers must have a PlayChip account with a
balance of at least one PlayChip in order to enter
the PlayChip Ecosystem. This requires correctly
completed KYC and allows priming transaction
values for later integrity checks.

Customer Onboarding Process

A customer must first apply for a PlayChip
account via the PlayXchange via mobile or web-
based portals, see Figure 4 (J). Then they must
obtain PlayChips via the PlayXchange or receive
them via the blockchain from third party wallets
(2). Once they have satisfied these requirements
the Player is eligible to select further preferences
via the PlayChain (3,4) and once complete, they
participate in partner gaming platforms (5).

There will be a one-off process to convert
existing PlayUp customers to PlayChip account
holders. All new entrants must follow the above
process.

3.3. Business, and customer

checks
The PlayChain supports the ability for gaming
platforms to carry out a number of pre-
authorisation checks on players before they enter
a game. These optional checks allow the games
to query PlayChip balances, regional registration
settings, client authorisations, time of day
restrictions, preferred language, or any other
client preferences. These queries arise in either
the PlayXchange or PlayChain depending on

Figure 5 — Pre-Authorisation Checks

The ability to check the user wallet balance and
associated KYC is essential before game play,
and relies on information entered at PlayChip
account creation, and movement of PlayChip
balances in the PlayChain and PlayXchange.

3.4 Loyalty Schemes and Bonuses

The already sizeable and increasing PlayChip
userbase will drive demand for the PlayChip
token on the open market. PlayChip Foundation
and their partner platforms will also have
promotions for account holders to help drive the
use and demand of PlayChips. The success of
these programs will increase the desire to hold
tokens and reduce the trading volatility of the
PlayChip.

In addition to the above, bonus promotions are
planned to drive the desire to hold PlayChips. An
example of this is a raffle that only verified
account holders may use PlayChip tokens to enter
into. This incentivises account holders to hold
more PlayChips to improve their chances of
winning. To ensure fairness, the seeds to the
random number generator are derived from a
PlayChain interaction with the Ethereum
blockchain that is explained later in section 4.

It is envisioned that long-term PlayChip holders
are rewarded with reduced transaction costs or
ability to participate in special “golden ticket
events”. These events offer special PlayChip
bonuses for a PlayChip token ID that meet the
following conditions:

e Owning a specified number of sequential
PlayChip IDs,

e PlayChip ID is a prime number,

e PlayChip ID matches the value paid out
on a given day.

e =PlayChip
significant date.

ID matches a_ chosen

These competitions, finalised via a Smart
Contract, ensure fairness and transparency of the
gaming environment. They also encourage
movement of PlayChips within the PlayChain
and open market in order for players to obtain the
PlayChip IDs they desire.

The PlayChip IDs are allocated upon entry to the
PlayChip Ecosystem, and recorded in the
PlayChain. The generation method of unique IDs
is covered in the following section. The IDs
currently have no meaning in the Ethereum
environ. The ID allocation encourages Players to
keep their PlayChips in the PlayChip Ecosystem.
In future the PlayChip will investigate the use of
non-fungible tokens (ERC721) in the open
market.

3.5 Provable Fairness and Integrity

The PlayChip Ecosystem has a fair and
transparent transactional method allowing third
parties to observe PlayChip operation and
integrity. Figure 6 provides a diagrammatic
explanation.

The mechanisms to deliver these measures are
covered in section 4.

3.6 Global Solution

The PlayChip will have application outside the
PlayChip Ecosystem. It may be transferred on the
Ethereum blockchain like other ERC20 tokens.
This will allow Players to carry out the following
functions:

e Transfer PlayChips to third party

exchanges that support the PlayChip,

e Utilise supported exchanges to convert
PlayChips to other crypto currencies,

e Utilise supported exchanges to convert
PlayChips to other fiat
supported by that exchange,

currencies

e Move PlayChips to cold wallets that
support PlayChips,

e Move PlayChips to supported online
wallets,

e Spend PlayChips at PlayChip Ecosystem
stores, or as a payment method on other
exchanges.

3.7. PlayChip Future Roadmap

The utility of PlayChip will increase the
evolution of blockchain technology. The
following design changes to PlayChip are
expected:

e When future blockchain transaction
speeds are increased the PlayChain may
be replaced with a blockchain equivalent.
PlayChip transactions will strike directly
onto an open improving

transparency in the PlayChain.

chain

e With the evolution of Smart Contracts
the ecosystem business rules will be
PlayChip Foundation Whitepaper

automated on behalf of the users, players,
game partners, and the Foundation.

e Non-fungible tradeable tokens
introduced to increase interest in specific

PlayChip IDs.

In summary the first iteration of the PlayChip will
utilise many different aspects of blockchain
technology, and as the technology evolves more
features may be applied to the PlayChain.

4 PlayChip and Ethereum Methods

In order for the PlayChip Ecosystem to meet its
business objective the PlayChip must be designed
to meet the following technical requirements.

4.1 Token Requirements

The PlayChip Token will be launched via an
initial coin offering and be tradable on the
PlayXchange and third-party exchanges. At
launch the PlayChip will have an issue price of
US$0.01, however as the PlayChip trades on the
open market it will fluctuate to market demand.
The PlayChip has the following design, which
will improve with technological advances:

e Ability to fork to new standards,
e Migrate to new blockchains,

e Support joint front and backend

blockchain solution,
e Enable bulk transactions,

e Possible carriage of fairness data on
blockchain,

e Possible non fungibility to support global
PlayChip IDs.

4.1.1
The PlayChip Ecosystem is designed to support a
variety of gaming platforms, each with their own
performance requirements. Due to the nature of
real time online sports, tight timing requirements
are placed on transaction times of the PlayChain
to ensure seamless user experience and system
integrity.

Transaction Timing and Scaling

At its initiation it is expected that the PlayChip
Ecosystem must support over one million users.

August 2018

This is measured against existing Ecosystem
users [1]. It will be designed to scale to two
million users, to meet growth projection for the
year ahead.

The transaction load on the PlayChain will vary
depending on the time of day, significant events,
and increasing game platform partners. It will be
designed to scale to meet demand.

Blockchain solutions are challenged by this
environment, but technology is rapidly evolving
to increase transaction performance using
sharding and sub-chains [5].

4.1.2 Transaction Options and Costs

It is intended that the PlayChain and
PlayXchange will group transactions to the
Ethereum blockchain to reduce average
Ethereum GAS. This will allow PlayChip users
to have a free or reduced cost cash out option.

Alternatively, if players wish for faster PlayChip
transactions via the PlayXchange, the player may
fund the transaction with PlayChip and complete
it on the PlayXchange.

It is expected that blockchain evolution will
provide reduced or no GAS. PlayChip may
migrate to improved blockchain platforms if that
is the case.

4.1.3. Portability

As blockchain technology evolves, PlayChip and
PlayChain efficiencies will follow suit. Every
effort will be made to improve efficiency with
minimal redesign of the modular architecture.
Additionally, due to the high adoption of ERC20
for current tokens, it is expected that future
blockchain technology will be backward
compatible to ERC20, or mechanisms developed
to port or fork ERC20 tokens to future standards.

4.1.4 Availability

The PlayChip Ecosystem is designed to survive
multiple single points of failure through
advanced design principles. These includes the
communication paths as well as_ server
infrastructure.
PlayChip Foundation Whitepaper

4.1.5 Security

The PlayChip Ecosystem is being designed with
a “defence in depth” approach with strong
boundary protection, identity and authentication
services, internal intrusion detection and
prevention services, and extensive integrated
logging and management services.

Many of the integrity and fairness measures
guard against cyber intrusion and data breach
with identification of third-party alterations of
transactional, behavioural, or user, data.

4.1.6 PlayChip Format

The ERC20 Token [3] has been chosen for the
initial PlayChip implementation due to its
widespread adoption and ease of handling in third
party exchanges and wallets. Other standards
were also considered, such as ERC 223 [4] for
ability to back out transactions, and ERC 827 to
carry data such as fairness inside the PlayChip.
The development of non-fungible tokens
(ERC721 [4]) is also of interest, allowing
PlayChip to carry unique token IDs and assisting
in development of loyalty bonuses for PlayChip
holders.

The design decision is to stay with ERC20 until
the other ERC standards have evolved to provide
improved security, and backward compatibility
with ERC20 for migration purposes. The
PlayChip Ecosystem is intended to be rolled out
in progressive phases between 2018, and 2020
[1].

4.2 PlayChain Blockchain Methods

4.2.1
A common native mechanism to seed random
number generation is proposed for the PlayChip
Ecosystem. It will rely on extracting hash values
from blockchain transaction records and using
them as seed for random number generation.

The seeds will be available for use in the

themselves. The random number mechanism has
a range of proposed uses such as:

e Loyalty scheme rewards
e Golden ticket bonuses
e Integrity checks.

e PlayChip ID generation.

4.2.2 PlayChip ID Generation

The unique identification of PlayChips within the
PlayChip Ecosystem is designed to support
customer loyalty programs. There is currently no
anticipated need for PlayChips held by the
Foundation, or other non-player accounts, to
require PlayChip IDs.

Figure 8 — PlayChip ID Mechanism

There are a few proposed ID creation methods.
The simplest being a random number generator
mechanism that generates numbers of a chosen
length, checks them for uniqueness, then applies
them to PlayChips held in Players wallets.

Alternatively, the PlayXchange may hold a
combination of values taken from characteristics
on the latest Ethereum or PlayChip transaction on
the blockchain and implement unique IDs
allocated to PlayChips when added to PlayChain
user ledger.
PlayChip Foundation Whitepaper

A business decision by the Foundation will be
made on whether PlayChips in the Players Free
and Paid wallets have the same status in future
loyalty programs. However all PlayChips in the
Ecosystem will have unique IDs.

4.2.3 PlayChain Event Logs

The PlayChain is able to keep immutable event
logs. The event log will be implemented as a
database. The log is likely to reside on a high
performance blockchain in future architecture.

Apart from maintaining the log of all user and
game transactions, the event log will act as a
source of information for the PlayChain to
measure statistics such as:

e Distribution of entry fees and winnings
(Top 1%, 5%, 25%, 50%)

e User statistics (winners, break even,
losers)

e Beginner user statistics (as above).

These statistics may be presented on a per game
basis, per game partner, or the entire PlayChip
Ecosystem. The statistics provide players unique
insight to the gaming platforms they access via
the PlayChip Ecosystem.

4.2.4 PlayChain Integrity Check

The PlayChip will ensure integrity of operation
by maintaining the log as a secure record of
transactions and publication to the Internet. The
PlayChain also provides a mechanism to ensure
the reports and logs are immutable, or if changes
are made, they are easily detectible.

5 PlayChip Ecosystem Design

The PlayChip Ecosystem comprises elements of
online gaming and blockchain technology shown
below in Figure 12.

5.1 Moving PlayChips to the Ecosystem
After the onboarding process described in section
3.2, Players will receive PlayChips from the
PlayXchange in their Play Wallets.

Alternatively, PlayChips can be bought at third-
party partner exchanges and sent to an
appropriate third party wallet or their PlayWallet
via the Ethereum network.

PlayChips sent to the PlayWallet involve sending
the PlayChip through the PlayChip Foundation
merchant wallet supported by the PlayXchange,
which allocates the PlayChips to corresponding

user gaming wallets in the PlayChain. Due to the
business rules in the gaming environ there will be
wallets directly supported by the PlayXchange ie
User Hot Wallets. These wallets may transact to
the Ethereum chain, and may be seen as a
standard exchange hot wallet.

Players who have PlayChips in their user hot
wallet may transfer PlayChips via _ the
PlayXchange to their corresponding integrated
PlayChip gaming wallets in the PlayChain to
engage in online gaming within the PlayChip
Ecosystem.

Players may convert their PlayChips to fiat
currency or other cryptocurrencies directly from
their third-party wallet through third-party

exchange, or from their PlayWallet through the
PlayXchange. PlayChips located in the gaming
wallets have a number of mechanisms to transfer
out to other wallets with different timing and cost
implications.

User Interface

Figure 13 — PlayWallet Overview

A PlayWallet is comprised of a ‘PlayChip wallet’
used for gaming and an optional user ‘hot wallet’,
which allows users to transact directly with
Ethereum through the PlayXchange. These are
different feature sets of the same PlayWallet.

The PlayWallet is integrated into the
PlayXchange and PlayChain and able to be used
on Apple IOS and Android devices. In all wallets,
the users’ PlayChip balances, transactions, and
deposit addresses are standard features. As the
user hot wallet is more transactionally focussed it
will contain more details around currency
conversion rates like a conventional exchange-
based wallet. The PlayWallet will be more
focused around integration into the gaming
environment and rules involved in moving chips
in and out of the game interfaces. For example, as
PlayChips are placed into a game, they will move
into an escrow ledger until the results of the game
are known. PlayChips are then moved out of
escrow back into the wallet or remain in the game
wallet ledger. The actual movement of PlayChips
between wallets is carried out by the
PlayXchange and PlayChain.

5.3. PlayChain Wallets and Ledgers

There are multiple types of wallets and ledgers
within the PlayChain Ecosystem and this section
explains their interaction.

The PlayXchange is a cryptocurrency exchange,
comes with merchant wallets, and ability to
allocate coins and tokens to internal ledgers

August 2018

which represent the user’s allocation of assets on
the exchange.

The

wallets and ledgers aligned to the

PlayXchange are:

PlayChip Merchant Wallet — a hot wallet
attached to the PlayXchange for
receiving and sending PlayChips in and
out of the PlayChip Ecosystem over the
Ethereum blockchain. This wallet will be
a multi-signature wallet requiring a
multiparty process to send PlayChips.
The wallet will be accessed via a web
interface or integrated into an automated
business process via an API.

PlayXchange Wallet Ledger — an internal
database of allocations of coins and
tokens that are sent to the Merchant
wallet and allocated to the correct
destination address and user via an
internal process. Each of these ledgers
will have one or more blockchain
addresses associated with the user ID.
These ledgers will be used for both
PlayChain Players and PlayChain
Partners to transact PlayChips on the
public blockchain.

User Hot Wallet — an optional wallet
interface for sophisticated players to buy
and sell tokens directly via the
PlayXchange. This option may not be
implemented in the initial phase of the
development of the PlayChip Ecosystem.
The wallet will be primarily accessed via
a mobile device interface but may
optionally be accessed via a web
interface that supports 2FA.

e Partner Hot Wallet — a hot wallet
attached to the PlayXchange for the
purpose of partners receiving and
sending PlayChips in the open market.
This wallet will be a multi-signature
wallet to require a multiparty process to
send PlayChips. The wallet will be
accessed via a web interface or integrated
into an automated business process
through an API.

The other types of wallets and ledgers are those
which are reliant on the PlayChain:

e PlayChip Wallet — an interface for
players to view information on their
current holdings, transactions, addresses,
market values, KYC information, credit
card details, gateway tokens, bank
account details, other cryptocurrencies.
Additionally, Players may
purchases or cash out transactions
through the wallet. The wallet is also
tightly integrated into game interfaces so
that Players may move from wallet to
game interfaces seamlessly.

information. There will be a need to store
amounts of both paid and free PlayChips.
This ledger will also contain user
preferences such as language, game
registrations details, and a range of other
player specific information.

e PlayChain Partner Wallet Ledger —
during game play the PlayChips at risk
are moved from the Player ledger to an
escrow account. Winnings are then
returned to the Player ledger or losses to
the Partner ledger. All these transactions
are handled by the PlayChain.

Players will have a unified view of their PlayChip
activity from their mobile device. This unified
view is described as the PlayWallet where two
separate processes and interfaces support
different features in the Ecosystem with
transparency to the Player.

The PlayXchange will support the following key
functions:

PlayXchange

e ©The PlayWallet via customised APIs that

allow the PlayChip Foundation to
increase the sophistication of the
PlayWallet over time.

e Interfaces to the PlayChain to support the
movement of PlayChips within the
PlayChip Ecosystem.

e Interfaces with third party exchanges and
wallets on Ethereum and other selected
blockchains.

e The movement of PlayChips from the

e The PlayChip movement business rules

to meet regional gaming and

cryptocurrency regulation.

The PlayXchange will be supported with
PlayChain Foundation infrastructure and
designed to have high levels of integrity and
resilience.

PlayChip Foundation Whitepaper

The PlayXchange will be responsible for
managing the collection of player KYC and entry
to the PlayChain so that both systems may report
on AML and regional gaming regulation.

5.5 PlayChain and Game Interaction

Due to transaction scale and speed restrictions of
current blockchain technology the initial
implementation of the PlayChain will use
database technology.

Players use their smart device as primary
interface with the PlayChip Ecosystem, allowing
play in games provided by the gaming partners.

Both the Game and the PlayWallet communicate
with the PlayChain to ensure conditions are
correct for the Player to participate in the game
such as:

e Registered to Play

e Passed global and regional requirements
(via KYC data),

e Sufficient funds (Free or Paid),
e Player preferences match.

All transactions on the PlayChain are retained in
the event log and accessible by the PlayChip
Foundation, PlayChip Partners, and players in
order to ensure the ecosystem is open and
transparent. Transparency will be enhanced with
transactional and behavioural _ fairness
mechanisms enacted by the Ecosystem and
Ethereum chain.

Gaming events will be carried through REST
APIs to the gaming platforms in a similar manner
to the operation of the existing platforms. The
existing game graphical user interfaces (GUI)
will be integrated into the PlayWallet as part of
joining the PlayChip Ecosystem. Additionally,
our operational partners will interface with the
PlayChain to allow for the movement of
PlayChips between user wallets and gaming
platforms.

The PlayChain provides the support mechanism
for the wallet, ledgers, and transaction logs, and
is an integral part of the gaming process and
compliance regime.

In addition to normal system maintenance and
support tasks, the PlayChain administrators will
be able to access the event log and query
transactions in order to resolve customer
transaction disputes, as is required by law. Once
appropriate technology becomes available, this
could become another task that could be
performed by oracle masternodes on a
proprietary blockchain.The Players’ PlayWallet
will also have the facility to show individual users
transaction logs as well so that Players are equally
well informed on the status of past and active
games.

5.6 Centralised Identity Mechanisms
Central to the PlayChip Ecosystem is an Identity
and Access Mechanism (IAM) [6] that provides
security on who may or may not access physical
devices, software services, and administrative
roles. It will also provide the engine behind the
2FA and multi-signature processes implemented
for higher value transactions or more
sophisticated Player accounts. Future solution
flexibility consideration may include other
identity and access methods such as biometrics,
hardware, and tokens.

Architecture for mobile application identity is
being considered to integrate support to the
overall PlayChip security architecture.

6 PlayChip Future Architecture

Wherever possible, blockchain design principles
are being integrated into the current backend
design for future transition to a seamless
blockchain enabled backend.

Examples are:
e Separate wallet/ledger architectures

e Using ERC20-like APIs wherever

possible.

e Designing processes around immutable
records (fairness and integrity methods,
audit trails, PlayChip IDs)

e Integrating logic into blockchain
variables (random number seeds)

In order for future architecture to support
blockchain technology in the backend and
become an integral part of the PlayChip and game
platforms, blockchain technology will need to
advance in performance and scaling.

The initial approach applied to Ethereum scaling
is to perform as many transactions off-chain and
use the blockchain sparingly — this is why the
PlayChain is designed as it is today.

The second common approach relies on a future
third generation Ethereum implementation of
sharding [5], where the Ethereum state machine
is segmented and processed separately in parallel
with other segments. This increases scalability at
the cost of security and decentralisation. It is also
predicted that this approach may reduce GAS as
less work is required per shard.

An alternate approach for the backend design is
to use a completely new blockchain technology
designed specifically for high speed transactions.
Examples of these under consideration are:

e EOS ~ has a target 6000 tps [7],

e High Performance Blockchain — has a
target of 1,000,000 tps and no transaction
fees [8].

e = Quarkchain — target 2000tps [9],
e = Ziliqua — 2400tps [10].

August 2018

To put this into context, the PlayChain is
estimated to need to support 3-5000tps for a 2
million user base, including surge demand. These
numbers are implementation dependent, and
development of the first iteration of the
PlayChain will help refine this requirement.

The PlayChip Foundation will also consider
implementing a consensus chain for bets that
trusted third party data feeds cannot verify. In this
instance, oracle masternodes will serve as the
consensus agents of the betting smart contract,
verifying the outcomes of the bet and enacting the
payouts via Smart Contract. This could be
performed by the PlayChain (once suitable
technology becomes available), or a secondary
blockchain.

The PlayChip Foundation will continually assess
these technology options in order to keep the
PlayChip at the forefront of blockchain
functionality, whilst preserving the ease of use,
and integrity of the overall Ecosystem. The
PlayChip and PlayChain will be migrated as and
when technology improves.

At this early stage the solution is based on a next
generation Ethereum or the ERC20 token, but
could be migrated to an entirely new chain
technology suitable for high volume gaming
transactions. The migration would resemble the
process completed by EOS and TRON [11]. This
approach will allow introduction of benefits of
consensus and Smart Contracts to the PlayChain,
where it makes sense, and allows the PlayChip
and PlayChain to remain at the forefront of the
industry.

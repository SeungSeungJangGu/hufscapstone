1. Executive Summary

The global financial crisis revealed significant weaknesses in the existing financial system and some of the
vulnerabilities already showed their impact on the interconnected global market. The world economy is
still struggling with slow growth rate today’. Transferring money for remittance, money lending across
international borders is still very complicated, time consuming’ and expensive’. Existing systems running
on traditional banking channels are slow and full of intermediaries, higher exchange rates, counter-party
risks, bureaucracy and extensive paperwork’.

More than 3.5 billion people are still unbanked® or underbanked® and have few opportunities to have a
safe and secure way to participate in the global economy. On-boarding this missing population to the
benefits of the global financial system is key in order to provide a sustainable solution for their future
economic outlook. However, it turns out that consumers and businesses are struggling to leverage the
benefits of the Blockchain infrastructure due to poor usability, non customer centric approach and
improper legal implementation.

Cashaa built its infrastructure on the blockchain and utilizes artificial intelligence to power mainstream
adoption for financial products. It empowers the banked and unbanked population, facilitates low cost
currency exchanges, enables participation in the global economy and develops the new outlook for this
community by using open architecture. |Instead of rebuilding or riding on the rails of archaic banking
infrastructure, we built Cashaa to allow consumer adoption of cryptocurrencies, which let people move
money as they wish at low cost and high speed, without having to understand the technical details of
crypto and blockchain technology, thereby making it user friendly, secure, and affordable.

This whitepaper fills the gap between the existing financial system and emerging non-user friendly
technologies by presenting a secure and simple way to use payments and banking architecture that aims
to lower financial inclusion barriers and provide financial services to the banked and unbanked. We
present the advantages of the Cashaa system, outlining its requirements and goals, along with the
architecture for its financial ecosystem. In addition, we present the results of Cashaa’s use case for a
remittance and trading system that involved over 12,770 registered users from 141 countries.

2. The Cashaa: The next generation banking platform for the next billion

The Cashaa team is building a next generation model for financial services which is based on blockchain
technology and artificial intelligence which will empower devices with biometric identification systems to
solve the problems of the existing financial system for the unbanked as well as banked population’.

Problem 1:

Having a traditional rail infrastructure, where moving money requires huge processing efforts includes
endless problems. One of the main reasons for friction in this current system is that information is siloed
between the players in the industry. A meagre amount of engineering is done on the payment systems
which are compatible across payment networks and financial institutions. Examples include FedWire®,
CHIPS®, SWIFT?®, consumer card payment networks, NSCC/DTCC™, OCC™, ACH’? and many others
depending on countries”.

Problem 2:

The recent emergence of cryptocurrency tokens showed a silver lining to save us from the legacy systems.
However, it turns out that a growing number of users and businesses are struggling to leverage on the
existing blockchain infrastructure. The primary role of blockchains was to solve coordination and
synchronization problems amongst multilateral agreements between a network of participants, but it
seems that these multiple blockchains are now giving a hard time to “real users” and have become a
bottleneck for the mainstream adoption’. Also the current attempts by others to provide blockchain
based solutions lack the workflow needs of small and medium sized enterprises, and the applications are
not addressing the average consumer's issues and not providing legally compliant solutions to their users.

Vision:

We believe there should be an efficient alternative to existing payment and banking systems. Our
blockchain-based payments system aims to lower financial inclusion barriers and provide financial services
to the banked and unbanked. Our vision is to build the payments and banking infrastructure for the future

We already built and beta tested a blockchain-powered platform, which offers innovative trading and
money transfer services between fiat and crypto currencies. 12,770 beta users across 141 countries tested
the platform transacting @ 2108.23486 (approx. $10 M).

Cashaa video (The video gives an overview of cash transfer; over time, Cashaa can process payments in
many other forms and does not require manual intervention or in-person settlement.)

During the trading & remittance process, the Bitcoin seller and buyer are asked to deposit their Bitcoins in
the escrow. The seller has to deposit 100% of the coins which they have to sell, while the buyer has to put
10% collateral which is released as soon as the process completes. The Bitcoin escrow address used in this
test transacting  2108.23486 is mentioned below:

https://blockchain.info/address/16Z9HPAMriVDmFCqnYzXnLWVfhyxcoW8Qj (Secondary Wallet)

Major countries where we saw the biggest adoption of our beta test include UK, Nigeria, India, Indonesia
and Philippines. During this beta test, we were able to test our Remittance and Trading product which
created a win-win situation for both the cryptocurrency traders community and the money senders
community.

Compared to any other existing trading platforms, our peer to peer exchange with liquidity providing
mechanism from the remittance industry, clearinghouse messaging network and escrow system resulted
in increasing market size, higher profit margins, and better speculation opportunities for the traders with
lower security risks. We found that between and within countries, entrepreneurs could bring the
advantages of cryptocurrency to their community by using our open API to build global and local payment

solutions. We also validated the opportunity for money transfer shops to switch their payment service
providers from traditional MTOs to Cashaa. Agents can become less expensive than their competitors, and
gain a good market share while benefiting from Cashaa’s cost-saving efficiencies. Additionally, Cashaa
validated during the beta test the relevance of providing 24/7 availability, a rating system, a tool to import
reputations from other platforms, while introducing the security advantages of a P2P exchange.

Key Benefits of Beta Test:

e The Cashaa platform (the “Platform”) went through several iterations to be robust, and is now

capable of handling large transaction volumes.

e The Platform is upgraded with strong KYC, AML policies and compliance to make it fully compliant

with regulations.

e Advanced escrow features increase the protection of stakeholders from any manipulation, thus

mitigating counterparty risk so that customers can use the platform with confidence.

e Operational processes are enhanced to optimise our user experience by involving our community

in the bug bounty program through our social media and helpdesk.

4. Design Approach

From the architectural point of view, to implement the concept, the Cashaa system is divided into five
main component layers that help the platform to scale, maintain and add new features while maintaining
the highest level of security in a decentralized environment for the blockchain features. We also recognize
that blockchain technology enables business collaborations that require high reliability and shared, trusted
privacy to preserve immutable data repositories for smart contracts.

In order to take technical advantages and speedy time to market, Cashaa has teamed up with various
organisations to leverage their pre-existing work such as Agrello Foundation?’ for its Al based self aware
contract capabilities, Auxledger”° for its robust infrastructure which has already onboarded 53 million
identities and other enterprise infrastructures that would help to scale faster with the built-in capabilities
of disrupting businesses and impacting millions of people across the globe. Coinfirm which provides data
that puts entities on the safe side in terms of regulatory and fraud risk related with cryptocurrencies .

Our design approach is focused around reflecting our vision of customer centricity and user friendly
applications while utilising the capabilities and promises of blockchain technology.

As cyber security is crucial for a fully digital service and to protect our systems, Cashaa has built systemic
solutions using the most advanced statistical and deep learning techniques to detect and prevent threats
in real-time. The integrated defense models have been successfully applied across multiple cyber sources
and will continue to provide intelligent protection for the company’s critical business information.

1. CASConnect layer is the first step for each participant to pass. Here, basic KYC checks are done by
verifying their email ID and mobile number. For higher transaction slabs, users have to pass stringent
checks and have to follow a tiered KYC structure that involves OFAC, AML and other guidelines that vary
from country to country. This layer will also interact with banks and govt initiatives to use the existing KYC

in place. We also provide the option of biometric verification to include undocumented parts of the
population.

2. CASNet layer enables a blockchain-driven self-aware contract assisted by an agent for a decentralized
peer-to-peer (P2P) economy. It will have the matching engine and system to define fee %, margins and

Copyright 2017 @ Cashaa Limited
bonus. This layer will be using some of the high quality tech work done by our Smart Contract Advisor Alex
Norta”* and utilising the existing results achieved by Qtum and Agrello Foundation.

3. CASFabric is the middle layer with core components for decentralized exchange with clearinghouse
messaging network, fraud prevention, clock synchronization among the participants and liquidity provider
mechanism. This layer has the required admin tools allowing admin users to add new cryptocurrencies,
markets, fiat and create a trader partner contract within minutes to scale solutions, based on the industry
adoption and maturity. The developer SDK in C#, JAVA, Python and Go will be published to develop and
integrate it with the Cashaa platform. Currently, Cashaa has set up exchange and FX pairs APIs in JSON.

4. Our CASChain layer makes the network interoperable and cryptocurrency neutral, which may
eventually operate through any digital currency or token which traders prefer, namely, Bitcoin, Ether,
Ripple, NEO or any ERC-20 compliant token. Blockchain nodes of aforementioned cryptocurrencies will be
enabled and integrated within CASConnect, thereby making Cashaa a partner of choice for interoperability
to grow alongside with the needs of the financial services industry.

5. CASFiat layer will be integrated with the banking system incorporating cash instruments in multiple
currencies within the network. This layer is responsible to decide the FX conversion; ensures the
availability of each FX value available on the platform and also assists in working with 3rd party APIs such
as XE, Reuters easing communication with payment networks across the globe.

4.2 Blockchain Technology

Cashaa token is implemented using Ethereum EIP-20 (former ERC-20) standard. ”* The token is accepted
and traded in Cashaa’s own services, but is also compatible across different Ethereum wallets and
exchanges.

Cashaa’s blockchain technology stack is not limited to Bitcoin and Ethereum. When applicable, Cashaa uses
different blockchain technologies to decentralize its products. This will give benefits of robustness,
transparency, compatibility and scalability to Cashaa users.

Auxesis Group

Enterprise grade blockchain infrastructure with built-in capabilities disrupting businesses and impacting
millions of population across the country. The Cashaa project is aligned with AuxLedger to use this
technology for the identity management, compliance and banking integration.

Akash Gaurav, CEO Auxesis Group: “We are excited to support Cashaa in India by providing AuxLedger
infrastructure. Together with the state Govt of India AuxLedger first implementation holds more than 53
Million Indians till date”

Agrello Foundation

Agrello project works towards creating legally binding self aware contracts based on blockchain. Cashaa
sees the opportunity for utilizing these for efficiency gains in decentralized trading and microfinancing
where the cost of engaging into a business relationship and writing agreements is high compared to the
transaction value. Agrello self aware contracts combined with Agrello identity and digital signature enable

fast and secure contract conclusion.

Agrello CEO and co-founder Hando Rand: “We think the Cashaa project is revolutionary in Fintech, it
combines the potential of blockchain with vast increasing demand of P2P money transfers worldwide. We
see huge potential in cooperation”

Qtum Foundation

Qtum combines uniquely Bitcoin functionality with the EVM in that it allows to use the UTXO protocol
together with SPV so that it is possible to work only with the headers of transactions. Differently to
Ethereum, this allows for the use of lite wallets that also run on mobile devices.

Qtum Chief Scientist Alex Norta: “Cashaa can leverage the Qtum smart-contract system by developing
mobile apps and also having a performing and scalable PoS platform. ”

5. Products

As a product-driven company our focus is to solve the problems using disruptive technologies to create
products and services for simple and easy use. At Cashaa we work to build the next generation of
consumer-centric payments and banking products on target to be the most cost-effective and innovative
available on the market.

5.1 Wallets

Cashaa Wallet will be a one stop destination for users to use existing and other planned services. Products
will be added as Cashaa secures the appropriate licences. For this purpose we are also partnering with
existing institutions to leverage their licenses where required. Cashaa Wallet is an alternative to traditional
banking with a better way to spend, save and share your money, fee-free and straight from your mobile.
The Cashaa App can accesses a global payments network that enables worldwide acceptance of the digital
wallet. Our digital local currency account is a gateway to widespread cryptocurrency adoption, pairing it
with access to mainstream financial services and smart new features on a simple, user-friendly platform.

The Cashaa App (called: Cashaa) will be available for free on Android or IOS shortly and is already
accessible through our WebApp (see milestones for more details).

Some of the core functions of the app will be provide depending on regulatory framework and licences.

5.2 Physical & Virtual cards

Each Cashaa Wallet includes a Cashaa prepaid card which complements the wallet. Physical prepaid cards
are the most convenient way to connect virtual assets in the finance sphere. Through our card issuance
partnerships with global payment networks, cards can be accepted by more than 39 Million merchants as

Copyright 2017 @ Cashaa Limited
well as POS terminals, the adoption of which is growing exponentially with existing 3 Million ATMs which
enable to withdraw cash worldwide.

Digital Indian Case Study Results: “In India Point-of-Sale transactions saw 88 percent rise, while mobile wallets
transactions doubled. Nearly 6.5 lakh POS machines by Public Sector Banks have been issued to merchants to benefit
from low rentals to promote digital transactions”.

Some of the core functions of the card:

1. Real time conversion from crypto to local currency at point-of-sale
2. Chip-and-PIN EMV card

3. The ability to withdraw cash from any ATM

4. Accepted at merchants POS

*Depending on the country, product manuals will be issued including details such as the exact fee of each
service.

5.3 Micro Lending

The World Bank reported that less than 1 in 10 people across the world’s low and mid-income population
have a documented credit history. It recommends using non-financial data for judging creditworthiness
using the power of the peer-to-peer economy, which revolutionized the way people do business”, and due
to which the financial sector has seen some impressive advancements. Cashaa microloans are small p2p
loans that are issued by individuals on our platform. These loans can be issued by a single individual or
aggregated across a number of individuals who contribute a portion of the total amount”. CAS tokens will
be used to determine the credit score and are used as integral part of the system, explained in section
11.1.

This product will serve dual purposes:

1. Individuals who cannot obtain credits from a bank, or users in third world countries will be able to
borrow money to start small businesses or for individual needs.
2. The second purpose is to give access to new lending opportunities. The lenders are individuals who

pledge a certain amount of money to loan out a deserving entrepreneur in another country.

Case Studies for Micro Finance in India and Bangladesh:

The microfinance industry has seen tremendous growth over the past five years, growing at a 45% CAGR"!,
It has witnessed rapid evolution with regulatory reforms post the Andhra Pradesh crisis in 2010 to regulate
a product, its pricing and protection of customer interest. This includes growth of regulated NBFC MFIs - a
special class of RBI regulated entities carrying out microfinance, the formation of the first ever
self-regulatory organizations (SROs) of the RBI, also Aadhar based lending by NBFC MFIs and
transformation of some of the entities into universal and small finance banks.

The key reason for the growth of the sector has been its ability to adapt changes, showing resilience in the
face of challenges and an ability to maintain high repayment rates of almost 99.5%.

In Bangladesh, the Nobel Prize winning Grameen model of social collateral combined with a high touch
model and rigorous credit bureau discipline has helped to maintain high levels of repayment for small ticket
sized unsecured loans”.

5.3 Peer-to-peer exchange (Beta Tested)

Cashaa has successfully connected a large number of individuals globally, who use the platform to trade
cryptocurrencies across the globe without without the hassle of international payments to the seller.
(Traders from 141 countries in 97 different currencies registered during our beta test). These traders
receive local fiat currency in exchange for selling and buying cryptocurrency. The Cashaa platform will be
equipped with portfolio management services which enables market analysis, allowing users to share
insights on markets, display their achievements and receive trading signals. Cashaa therefore lowers
barriers to entry in the growing FX trading market for crypto currency, and thus supports experienced and
new traders (traders required licences in some jurisdictions). Cashaa’s peer to peer exchange even allows
traders to buy and sell cryptocurrency which is not available in their local country’s exchanges. (As an
example, users in India can buy XRP, LTC, NEO, OMG in their local INR). This will bring balance in the entire
crypto ecosystem and lead to systematic growth of cryptocurrency across the globe.

Core Features:

In-built crypto wallet

5.5 Peer to Peer Insurance (Future)

Insurance is a vital part of our everyday life and protects us from the uncertainty of life. As a fintech
company, it is important for Cashaa to protect its users and provide access to innovative insurance
services. The founding concept is to have a more efficiently replicated method for a group of friends or
associates as to what traditional insurance companies do for a large number of strangers. This will make
insurance more social, cheaper and clearer, thus educating people to the social function of insurance
coverage and leveraging on business (like product construction) models of a mixed economy to provide
users with better service and better experience at a lower cost.

Our smart contract enabled insurance platform can be used for insuring the household, personal liability,
legal expenses, travel and many more. Smaller claims and deductibles will be settled by peers in the group
while the large claims are still covered by traditional insurers, with whom the firm partners in future.

Our team already successfully built the first Italian peer to peer insurance[?’][?2] company backed by AIG[?*]
insurance products, an American multinational insurance corporation with operations in more than 80
countries and jurisdictions. Our team’s experience will be leveraged to build this innovative product on a
blockchain.

9. Go to Market Strategy

9.1 Strategic Partnerships

As a fast and strategic approach to reach the remote parts of Asia & Africa, partnerships are the key
elements for the same. Several such partnerships are already under development and include the
following segments, namely,

e Partnerships with banks operating in the corridors where Cashaa successfully completed its beta
test to ensure a successful ‘last mile’ delivery to local bank accounts, prepaid cards and other easy ways to
cash out at a convenient location.

e Partnerships with government agencies to circulate Cashaa cards. As an example, in India, Cashaa
will use Auxesis Group for the AuxLedger which has 53 Million users resulting of a State Government
partnership.

e Partnering with agents running traditional MTO networks for Western Union, MoneyGram or Ria.

e Partnerships with leading global telecom companies, providing immediate opportunities to start
mobile banking products.

e Partnerships with E-Commerce platforms for payment providers to increase coin utility. For
example, a_ recent partnership has been signed up with one of the largest restaurant & pub search
company in the UK.

e Partnering with crypto wallet providers to use their existing user base. Examples are branded
Bitcoin wallets such as Airbitz, with whom Cashaa concluded a partnership.

9.2 Legal, Auditing and Regulatory Partnerships

The Cashaa team’s extensive banking and payments experience helps us to know the nuts and bolts of
internal process and license requirements:

e Our team is already in negotiation with companies to acquire the e-money and banking licences to
save money and time.

e Partnerships with banks and financial institutions to leverage their licences to speed up our process
to go live. For example, in UK, Africa, India & EU we are leveraging our relations to use different payments
networks. In Europe through our strategic partnerships we are going to use the Mastercard network.

e Working closely with auditing firms to leverage the auditability, transparency and accountability of
the Cashaa platform to encourage its use.

3° What is an Initial Coin Offering (ICO)?

Copyright 2017 @ Cashaa Limited
10.1 Token Functionality

The CAS token is a key component of the system that enables trading, lending and gives access to other
upcoming services in the CAS ecosystem. CAS serves two main objectives: First, the token is the fuel of an
internal mechanism of the Cashaa ecosystem. Second, it is part of the governance component of the CAS
system. Each Cashaa wallet is initially equipped with a predefined amount of CAS and cannot be used
without a minimum CAS balance.

10.1.1 Benefits of CAS token

Acquiring premium services in the Cashaa ecosystem (Membership)

Ability to trade cryptocurrencies anywhere in world (Trading)

Lower transaction fees for the $ 600 Billion remittance industry (Remittance)
Providing the credit score for lenders (Micro Finance)

Ability to participate in governing mechanism of CAS usage (Governance)
Secure P2P money transfers (Escrow)

10.1.2 Acquiring tokens

e Token distribution
e Secondary markets
e Rewards collection

10.1.3 Spending tokens

10.1.3.1 Membership

Proof of CAS ownership will be required to access Cashaa premium services for:

e Higher FX transfer (Spend, transfer and exchange an unlimited amount of money anywhere in the
world at the interbank exchange rate without fees.)

e 2X ATM allowance (Double your free monthly ATM allowance with free Cashaa premium
withdrawal of €400 per month)

e Free transfer (Free, fast money transfers in available currencies to banks globally with the real
exchange rate)

e Express delivery (Card will be delivered using express shipping method for faster delivery of the
new cards or replacement cards)

e Free overseas medical insurance (Get the best medical treatment while abroad with expenses paid

into your Cashaa account in case of any mishappening, provided by third party partner insurance
company)
e Free 24/7 customer support

Copyright 2017 @ Cashaa Limited
e Early adopter rewards and beta access

10.1.3.2 Microfinance & Credit Score

CAS token holders will be able to access instant loans at low interest rates compared to non token holders,
and will also be able to give loans.

For the borrower, CAS ownership leads to improved loan conditions, rewarding users for taking a larger
stake in the Cashaa system. CAS tokens can be both earned or bought, respectively improving the owner's
creditworthiness.

For each loan paid back in time and fulfilling any specific conditions, borrowers are rewarded with CAS, the
accumulation of which improves the credit score of low credit rated individuals and small businesses
anywhere in the world.

Another way to receive improved lending conditions is via other users vouching with their own CAS tokens.
In this case, following a fulfilment of all repayment criteria, both the borrower and the voucher are
rewarded with CAS tokens.

Finally, in addition to receiving paid interest rates, lenders can earn CAS tokens by providing loans as a
reward for their risk. To facilitate lenders’ decision making, each user's credit score will be available online.
In case any of the involved entities fails to fulfill their duties of the lending agreement, the provided CAS
tokens are confiscated by the smart contract. Furthermore, users can sell or donate their CAS tokens to
other users directly, thereby improving the receiver's credit score and losing their own.

10.1.3.3 Trading

Only traders with enough CAS can participate in the trading network and are entitled to create smart
contracts for trading. In the existing Cashaa system when a money sender puts their request to transfer
money, a seller and buyer compete for the local fiat in exchange of cryptocurrencies.

For example, a money sender puts a request on our platform to transfer £1000 from London to New Delhi.
Based on the FX and proprietary algorithm Cashaa calculates the best possible rates and gives the users
e.g. INR 84,000. Cashaa immediately splits the lead into two parts where all crypto traders in London get
notified and see on the platform that they have an option to receive £1000 for X BTC. In the same way,
buyers will see their option to buy Y BTC by paying INR 84,000. To accept the deal the seller has to put
100% of X BTC into a uniquely created escrow wallet, while the buyer has to put 10% of Y BTC into the
escrow. The system generates two passcodes which are used by the money sender and seller in London &
buyer and receiver in New Delhi to verify themselves respectively. In section 3 we presented the case how
this system helps to create a win win situation for both parties.

Replacing the buyer escrow with CAS will allow multi cryptocurrency exchanges by removing the
dependency on the crypto which the traders respectively decided to trade. Traders will be allowed to
execute the smart contract which will hold the required CAS. As this mechanism will allow traders to buy
and sell any cryptocurrency, it will boost the supply of cryptocurrencies in the countries where exchanges
currently do not support them, and balance it with countries where they are in surplus. Balancing the
entire ecosystem in this way can bring a systematic growth of cryptocurrency across the globe, e.g. Cashaa
traders in India will be able to buy LTC, NEO, BAT etc in INR.

Copyright 2017 @ Cashaa Limited
10.1.4 Governance mechanism

1. Governing voting system is another objective of the CAS token. The governance mechanism is
executed by stakeholders. Stakeholders are technological and business partners to Cashaa project, non
profit organizations of the industry, advisors and some token holders. Stakeholders vote on how much of
the company revenue will be used to buy the tokens from the exchange on a regular base.

2. CAS stakeholders can also vote on requests to update Cashaa token contracts which hold the
vesting period of company tokens. Each user’s voting depends on the proportion of owned CAS token
compared to the available tokens in market. The company will present reasons and benefits of doing so at
Bitcointalk or other media, and a smart contract based voting will be conducted to unlock the vesting

period.

What is NANJCOIN?

NANJCOIN is an Ethereum token developed and managed by the users of
2ch.sc’s “Nandemo Jikkyou” message board, or NanJ for short. The Nandemo
Jikkyou board is a place where passionate sports fans (also known as Nanjinians
or J-Boys) gather and engage in sublimely trivial banter day and night. Shortly
after its creation, the NANJCOIN Discord community quickly gained momentum,
attracting a variety of members from all walks of life, and continues to grow by
the day.

NANJCOIN was conceived with the mission of better enjoying sports and aims
to expand by working together with business partners in the sports industry. By
making transactions with NANJCOIN, you will reap greater and more unique
benefits unobtainable through regular payment methods. In addition, NANJCOIN
will also provide a system for conveniently making donations to sports
organizations in need of financial support, be they individual players, teams,
niche domestic sports with little backing, or even regional sports clubs. (From
Stage 3) NANJ plans to implement a voting system through which members can
use tokens to nominate various sports teams to be managed directly by the

community.

*NANJCOIN is a fan community and is in no way affiliated with 2ch.sc or Sch.

NANJCOIN WHITE PAPER 2018
Fans wanting to make an impact.

One day in January of 2018, after seeing a message a community member known as Icchi (said to be the primordial user) posted to the board
reading, “I made a cryptocurrency,” the community sprung to action. Having acquired the “means” of a cryptocurrency, for days, we discussed how
to make the most of it, eventually coming to a consensus that we might as well use it to try to make a system with which we can contribute to our
favorite sports teams. Following a round of surveys conducted within the community and on social media to hammer out a more concrete course

of action, it was discovered that most people within the community wanted to make a more tangible impact on their favorite sports.

90% of fans who have never been to a game in person say that they would consider
purchasing tickets with NANJCOIN.

90% of fans who haven’t been to a sports game in the last year have responded to surveys saying that they would

gladly use, or at least consider using NANJCOIN to purchase tickets if the option is available. Some people also said °
that they would like to reserve seats where they can enjoy the game with fellow community members, while others eave
would like a way to go to sports games that isn’t so intimidating.

The percentage of people who
said they would consider using
NANJCOIN to purchase tickets.

Over half of sports fans wish to be more proactive in donating to players.
Over half of fans who have been to a sports game in the last year responded to surveys saying they would like to
take more action in the form of making donations to players and teams. Core fans who already purchase tickets and
merchandise would like even more ways to contribute, be it to individual players who made a fantastic play, teams,

or retired players looking to start a new life.

A world realized by NANJCOIN.

In junction with publicly developed applications, NANJCOIN plans to provide various features to the
userbase essential for enjoying sports, as well as proactively work with business partners to allow
NANJCOIN to be used with various sports-related organizations and facilities, both domestic and
international.

For example, let’s say someone who has never been to a baseball game before suddenly gets the urge
to one day. Having made the decision, they’re then confronted with various dilemmas. Who do | go
with? Where should | buy tickets? What should | do at the stadium? They may be overwhelmed and
intimidated to the point where they give up on going altogether. But what if someday, tickets and
entrance fees could be paid for through services provided by NANJCOIN? On top of that, if they had
the option to look for members within the NANJCOIN community to go with, or purchase seats in a
section reserved for NANJCOIN users, it would drastically reduce the hurdles and mental stress
involved. NANJCOIN provides the perfect opportunity for those looking to get into the joy of watching

sports games in person.

There are also many obstacles that arise when one decides that they
want to donate to an individual player or team. It’s difficult enough

finding the right place to send your donation, and even if you do, it's

JOHN SMITH

hard to be sure your money is going to where you intend. Those of you
who have made any sort of application form before may be familiar, but
the strong disconnect between end user and client can severely hinder
a process from working as it should.

But if fans could simply use the aforementioned application to pick
their player or organization of choice to donate to directly, it would
provide the means to support the sports industry easier than ever
before. Users would be able to check if their donation was received by
simply looking at the blockchain, all while making a difference from the

comfort of their own homes. This framework will allow the sports

industry to become more self-sufficient, effectively overturning the

industry’s conventional revenue models.

SINCE 2018

The Road to Becoming the Number One Cryptocurrency

With the motto of becoming the number-one used cryptocurrency, NANJCOIN plans to remain proactive in seeking out collaborations and

developing systems in the interest of building an economic bloc within the sports industry. We hope to aim for a world where the Blockchain
platform is ready for use in everyday life. We strive to create an ideal environment in which anyone is free to participate and contribute to the
NANJCOIN project. As passionate lovers of baseball, we first intend to form business relationships with various organizations within the industry
to pave the way for NANJCOIN to be used for baseball related goods and services. However, purchasing a baseball team (as seen on the roadmap)
is not our end goal. What sports teams require to become truly independent is a self-sustaining revenue system. Our goal is to develop a scheme
to make that dream a reality across every sport. Sports move and inspire fans, and fans in turn fuel the sports industry with their appreciation—that

is the kind of world we wish to create.

The Merits of ERC223 Tokens

NANJCOIN is an Ethereum token based on

the ERC223 standard and is the first

TokenName: NANJCOIN cryptocurrency developed in Japan. While

TokenSymbol: NANJ ERC20 is currently the most popularized
PublishNumber: 30 billion form of Ethereum tokens, ERC233 is

gaining attention as an upwardly

compatible standard that revises on

ERC20’s flaws, such as fixing the issue in which tokens can no longer be transferred in the
event one sends funds to an incorrect or invalid contact address. Additionally, with the
specification change, tokens can also be transferred at half the cost of the ERC20. ERC223 is
backwards compatible with ERC20, making it available for use in ERC20-supported service tools
and wallets such as MyEtherWallet, MetaMask, and Mist. ERC233 also carries the big plus of
being scheduled for used with revolutionary services like Raiden and Plasma in the near future.
Using the ERC233 standard as a base, NANJCOIN comes mounted with many features. For
example, using the Airdrop feature included, users can distribute tokens to multiple people
simultaneously via Airdrop while keeping transfer fees low. Furthermore, since this feature is
available to everyone, NANJCOIN holders can user Airdrop at any time. On top of that, account
freeze and lockup features are also included. The ability to freeze the addresses of malicious users
and temporarily lock management-held tokens allows us to both maintain and increase
NANJCOIN’s value. Additionally, the number of tokens in circulation can be adjusted through the

Burn (decrease) and Mint (increase) features. The Mint feature can also be turned off forever.

Most of the virtual currencies thus far have vague definitions of the requirements, such as
possessing a "majority", to become the "management team". Therefore, for clarity, the minimum
required possession percentage of NANJCOIN to function as the aforementioned management
team is set to be 10% of the total. The benefit of declaring this percentage is that even if the
management team sells out, the market will not collapse because the managing team does not
hold the majority. Certainly, there will be a secondary countermeasure of requiring the holder to
clearly state that it is not their intent to disturb the market by undercutting or overselling. Following
the opening game, we plan to sell 18 billion NANJ, which is 60% of the total issued volume.

Likewise, after the opening, burns and lockups will be implemented for unsold tokens.

NANJCOIN will provide a helpful push toward that future. And to that end, we

will remain strong in our efforts.

Abstract

My Neighbor Alice is a multiplayer builder game, where anyone can buy and own virtual islands,
collect and build exciting items and meet new friends. Inspired by successful games, such as
Animal Crossing, the game combines the best of the two worlds - a fun narrative for regular
players who want to enjoy the gameplay experience as well as an ecosystem for players who
want to collect and trade NFT:s, even if they have no idea what an NFT is.

My Neighbor Alice is not just a game for blockchain players. But it’s a game that could
introduce blockchain to millions of players.

The game is aimed at the diverse gaming community which can get easily onboarded from
regular platforms. Our main line of comparison lies within the traditional gaming market with the
same players being targeted as our audience. We are innovating a new unobtrusive way of
connecting an exciting game narrative to blockchain features. My Neighbor Alice has the
potential to attract millions of gamers, and an associated greater opportunity for revenues.

The game is designed in a way to allow players to “own the game” by exercising power over the
platform. Players also enjoy the democratic governance model based on a liquid democracy
and real-world inspiration rules over a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization).

My Neighbor Alice is the brainchild of Antler Interactive, an interactive game studio known for its
gaming innovations. Being a pioneer in VR gaming, the studio is experimenting with Augmented
Reality (AR) to bring gaming to a new qualitative level. In my Neighbor Alice Antler Interactive
leverages the Chromia platform, enabling advanced blockchain and in-game DeFi features.

My Neighbor Alice has a first version that runs and plays well, and proves that the technology
behind it works. The intent now is to fund this team as a new company, connected to a
non-profit and foundation, developing My Neighbor Alice so it becomes a commercial success
introducing millions of players to blockchain.
Introducing My Neighbor Alice

Game Overview

Welcome to the Alice world - a large island complex located in the Lummelunda archipelago. It
is a place where animals and humans share space, make friends and work together. Anyone
can join Alice’s neighborhood by buying a piece of land and performing various activities such
as fishing, bug catching and beekeeping, among other things. By interacting with neighbors and
helping Alice with her duties and daily activities, players earn a reward which can be exchanged
for in-game items that they can use on their lands.

After buying a piece of land, players will be able to design and decorate their property to make it
as unique and special as they want. For that, users can experiment with the landscape, use
in-game assets, like NFT:s, which are available in the form of vegetation, furniture, buildings or
animals, perform daily activities and participate in competitions and quests to earn more
rewards.

My Neighbor Alice is the first attempt to create a truly public application with an exciting plot that
would attract first ordinary players, secondly blockchain enthusiasts and DeFi nerds. It has a
light and intuitive interface with a variety of features to explore. In My Neighbor Alice, only you
will decide on how much you want to be involved in the game's decentralised features and DeFi.
Moreover, we designed the game in a way to make it “live forever” with a narrative that never
becomes boring.

Business Objectives, Market and Target audience

My Neighbor Alice is not to be seen as a game for blockchain players. It is first a game for a
large global audience of players in general. Absolutely no prior knowledge about
cryptocurrencies is needed. Because of that, we compare mainly with the normal game market,
and target the same players. A much bigger audience than previously seen in the field of
blockchain gaming, and an associated larger opportunity for revenues.

Market

Target audience

We have made an analysis of the target market of the Inspiration games such as Animal
Crossing. The conclusions are summarized in the table below. What is interesting is that we are
competing in an underserved market. There are many female gamers, but relatively few games
specifically made for them.

This is what is said about Animal Crossing:
“What | find interesting is that the 3DS core users consist of 69% male and 31%
female, but when | look at the numbers of people that bought Animal Crossing: New
Leaf and the 3DS handheld together recently, | see 44% male and 56% female
users. It’s quite an astonishing figure..”

Age My Neighbor Alice has a wide appeal, but primarily targeted towards
18 to 39 years old.
Geography My Neighbor Alice is expected to have the most users in North

America, Europe and East Asia.

Gender 60% Female and 40% Male.
Gamer Type Casual 50% / Core 50% / Hardcore 0%
Social Class My Neighbor Alice appeals to a wide range of social classes, although

probably upper and middle class because of the in-game monetization
and economy system you need to contribute to.

Lifestyle Adults who spend a lot of time indoors on technology such as games
consoles, computers or phones.

Taste All the different modes on My Neighbor Alice mean that it can appeal
to a lot of tastes, there is a sandbox mode for creative people, chat
and communication for social gathering. There are even educational
features to learn economy and software development.

Ethnicity and | Ethnicity and religion have no bearing on My Neighbor Alice appeal.
Religion
Age Rating The game is rated? PEGI7 for violence and PEGI12 as for gambling

and the use of crypto.

Inspiration

By looking at what inspires the game, as well as what similar games are out there, we can see
the commercial opportunities.

Creative inspiration
Here is what the creative designer mentions as inspiration for the game itself, gameplay and art.

<Game> Animal Crossing

The game takes inspiration from animal crossing island ownership. The ability to socialize with
friends and express creative freedom. Also daily tasks and activities such as fishing and
farming.

<Game> Minecraft
Inspiration from building mechanics, farming and other activities within the game.

<Medium> Stardew Valley
The freedom of choice, and open-ended gameplay, where the player chooses what they want to
do. Optional side quests.

<Game & Television> Pettson och Findus

The playful art and music from Pettson and Findus, as well as some of the “mini-games”
presented in the game. Pettson and Findus is a series of children's books written and illustrated
by Swedish author Sven Nordqvist, portraying a countryside. The books have worldwide book
sales of over 15 million and have been translated into 55 languages.

<Medium> Townscraper by Oskar Stalberg
The technicalities of procedural island building and the minimalistic graphical style.

Commercial Inspiration

We have observed a great success of creative games, of builder games, of cute games, of
farming games, of multiplayer games. Also the ideas for My Neighbor Alice is prime on the spot
with the trends. The Economist explains it like this:

AMID THE economic devastation wrought by covid-19, video games are a rare bright
spot. This year, the shares of Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard, two big games
publishers, have risen by 33% and 42%, respectively. Capcom, a Japanese
video-game maker, is up by 75%. It is little wonder that the sector is so hot. Video
games—especially live multiplayer ones that can be replayed endlessly—are great for
staving off boredom. They are an increasingly popular way to connect with friends,
too. During the pandemic, some enthusiasts have even used social games such as
“Animal Crossing” to stage weddings, concerts and nightly talk shows.*

So we believe in a fantastic potential. Here are some benchmarks:

Goals

Given the data from inspiration games mentioned, the unique attractive graphic style, and the
novel ideas we add from blockchain thinking, and PR-friendly and user friendly governance
model, we set these goals:

Millions of users

With the unique style and large interest in these kinds of games, as well as the unique element
we bring, we think the game can compete in the market and share similar numbers as the other
games, reaching millions of users.

Mainly, as no previous experience or interest in blockchain or cryptocurrencies is required, we
aim at fully developing the potential of blockchain economy, while abstracting its complexity
from the users.

Antler Interactive has with their previous games Krystopia (1 and 2) sold around half a million
copies, and sales are still increasing, so we do have some experience already to launch games
that have potential in millions of users.

Current Status: Game MVP Ready

My Neighbor Alice has been developed during 2020, and now has several key components
done. See this demo to see what we have: a multiplayer, blockchain enabled game with
landscape editor, chat, dialogues, map and really cute cows. If you react to the hexadecimal
public keys shown, the game will soon have a completely different onboarding process, this is
only for the demo. Besides that, if we only can make those cows stop rolling around, then we
can launch.

Competition

My Neighbor Alice is a game with several dimensions:

Blockchain, Multiplayer, Social

Blockchain games in this segment includes:

Decentraland: An open 3d world, like a second life on blockchain.

Sandbox: Also an open 3d world, inspired by minecraft.

Axis Infinity: A game with cute graphics, but with a different gameplay that is more about
collecting, breeding and battling. It also intends to not only be for blockchain experts. And we
are happy that Axis Infinity shares similar goals in letting users be part of controlling the games

development.

But My Neighbor Alice is unique in that it is an open world game with a strong visual identity
based on positive images and cuteness, intended for non-blockchain skilled players as the
12

primary target group. Also catering for an underserved market, women, who are a large base of
players but with less purposely created content.

Additionally, My neighbor Alice will use Chromia blockchain, which has proved to be a flexible
blockchain, focused on decentralized games, with the peculiarity of abstracting the blockchain
complexity from the gameplay and the user experience.

Key game features

Marketplace

One of the game’s main features is a virtual marketplace where players can buy and sell their
land and other in-game items, such as houses, fences, animals and plants, which will help them
to decorate their land in their own creative way.

Virtual islands

In the game, players could either purchase virtual
plots from Alice or in the marketplace. There is a
scarce supply of plots in the universe and each
piece of land is represented in the form of NFT
tokens. After the plot has been purchased, players
can change the form of the terrain and decorate it
with various in-game items such as houses, lakes,
decorations, animals, plants and other things that
can be purchased additionally.

The team is evaluating to run a land presale for the early investors.

Avatars

Each player is represented by an avatar in the game, and players could
interact with others through the avatar. Players could also modify the avatar by
installing different assets to it.

In-game assets

There are in-game assets that can be deployed into the game and they
can be bought on the marketplace. Among them - houses, animals,
veggies, decorations or cosmetic items for the player's avatar. In
addition, platform users can create assets using the NFT creator and
monetize their design skills! DeFi capabilities will be added to the
in-game assets.

Reputation system

“My neighbor Alice” will have a reputation system that rewards players as good citizens with
increasing benefits (up to participating in the Community Council).

As an example: a three-tier reputation system, in which players can upgrade their status
by purchasing virtual islands or NFT:s. Each new tier grants access to new cosmetic
items, rare NFT:s, interesting competitions and other tools which will help players to make
their land truly unique and exciting.

Shared Quests and Community events

One of our key values in the game is to create the atmosphere of friendship and common
interests. The ultimate purpose in My Neighbor Alice is to create an alternative beautiful world
where anyone can play, find friends and work together. Thus, My Neighbor Alice will enable
various possibilities for players to work on a shared goal and join resources to complete fun
activities. The game will also have community-created events where players will be able to
create and participate in activities.

On-chain forum for discussion

My neighbor Alice will also enable a decentralised forum, where users will be able to discuss the
game activities, figure out the upcoming votings schedule within the Decentralized Organization,
search for new friends, etc.

An example of such a forum can be found here https://testnet.chromunity.com/.

Blockchain Features

Game currency, The ALICE token

ALICE token is the native currency in the game, as well as mirrored as an ERC20 token. It
allows token holders to play, invest and also be part of the game. There is a fixed supply of
ALICE tokens.

There are several utilities of the token.:
e lItcan be used for payments between players.
e NFT and land can be purchased from the system using ALICE tokens.
e ALICE staking can offer reward to users.
e Game can reward ALICE tokens for completing tasks and winning competitions.

ERC-20 compatibility

The Chromia blockchain can also function as a Layer Two to other blockchains, and has
features for moving tokens between for example Ethereum and Chromia. An example of this is
the Hedget decentralized options trading platform.

There will be a mechanism to move the ALICE token back and forth between the Chromia and
the Ethereum network, and thus users are able to use exchanges on ethereum to ensure
liquidity.

Game Assets

Collectibles and scarcity

In gaming, the element of scarcity and collectible items have been around since even before
computers. Also in My Neighbor Alice, there will be limited editions, scarce items. In addition to
items designed by the game developers, there will be user-generated content.

The openness of a blockchain provides information about how many of an item exists, how
large is a limited edition. The additional openness of My Neighbor Alice's novel “decentralized
assets” explained below improves on this further, as you can openly inspect similarity of items.

Scarcity in My Neighbor Alice exists on different levels:

e Fixed supply of land

e Limited editions of items

e Scarcity limits of user-generated content. Users acquire rights to generate items,
these rights stipulate the max number of copies, thus enforcing scarcity
requirements.
Fully decentralized assets

In mainstream blockchain games, NFT consists of a small amount of binary data that represents
ownership of an asset. But there are many more elements needed to actually having full control
of an asset:

e How it looks

e Non-physical characteristics (strength of a sword, speed of a car)

e Game logic implementing the asset: Swinging a sword, driving a car

So far, in most blockchain games, this information is often stored elsewhere, not under the
control of the player and instead under the full control of the game company.

In My Neighbor Alice, we strive to improve on this as much as possible. So far blockchain
games have been an emperor without clothes, we aim to dress him up with something cute.

My Neighbor Alice stores much more data about items on-chain, using the Chromia originals
protocol, a standard for asset definitions. Also, the logic of items will be defined in a
free/libre/open-source game, running on-chain and being under the ultimate control of the
players, see the chapter on Community Council DAO.

Marketplaces and trading

One advantage of decentralized ownership is that they can be traded on marketplaces outside
of the game companies' influence. This can increase financial incentives for gamers to purchase
and create items in the game. Naturally, this feature will be available with My Neighbor Alice.

Items can be traded in several marketplaces:

blockchain based and ownership be with the players.

External marketplaces on Chromia

Items can also be read by the Chromia-developed
marketplace. Note on the picture how the Chromia
Market allows you to search for items based on data

16

about assets, such as color and item-category. This is due to the fact that more data about
assets are stored directly on the blockchain compared to many other blockchains.

Marketplaces on other blockchains

The Alice token is interchangeable with an ERC-20 Ethereum token, but also items and item
ownership might be transferred to other blockchains like binance smart chain.

In My Neighbor Alice, we strive to make items and item ownership interchangeable with other
relevant blockchains. This is a way to increase interest and potentially liquidity, and can also be
used for marketing purposes. The target group for My Neighbor Alice is however not primarily
blockchain gamers, so this feature has a “minor” priority. The Chromia project, who support My
Neighbor Alice, will fund and do this development as part of the Chromia platform. Also, we
emphasize once more that Chromia Originals is richer in data compared to normal NFT:s, and
the scope of interoperability will primarily target ownership rather than full asset data. In addition
to Ethereum, other more gaming focused platforms are potential targets for interoperability
development.

Marketplace on Steam

My Neighbor Alice will use the existing game platforms, such as Steam, to sell items, in
particular first hand items collections and in-game currencies. This is important for onboarding of
non-cryptocurrency users. We believe that we have a strategy to make this comply with the
terms of service.

A game controlled by players

Imagine a game that can not be shut down, lives forever, where players control the project. A
new way to implement games, challenging old models of doing business.

My Neighbor Alice will push the boundaries of blockchain gaming by letting the users control the
game and development. A public democratic application, with formal control by players and
other stakeholders such as investors.

Community Council, or DAO

My Neighbor Alice will be a decentralized organization called Community Council, a digital
democracy and mini-universe. This could not have been possible without blockchain, since we
now can implement rules that govern what source code is running. This is an embodiment of the
Chromia vision of public applications.
Free and open source

The source code will have an open source license so users can control and ultimately fork the
application. Note that this game depends on Unity, which is a non-free platform.

Logic on chain

The running game will be on the blockchain, as much as possible, thus avoiding the situation
where a single entity controls the server.

An ever-expanding world

NFT Creator

Chromia Originals

NFT Creator is a unique tool enabled by Chromia Originals which allows players to create and
design their own in-game assets based on certain constraints defined by a blueprint. Depending
on the rarity of a blueprint, a set amount of materials can be used in the creation of an object.
The more rare the blueprint, the more materials can be used to craft an object.

In order to prevent abuse, game developers reserve a right to impose constraining rules and
review steps for NFT:s creation. This process will be later handed over to the Community
Council DAO.

We anticipate that the NFT creator will be gradually rolled out to users, either through
competitions, or by selling the feature for Alice tokens.

Created by Eve
50 ALICE

Game Creator

Allowing users to create their own mini-games, quests, competition and even full games is in the
vision of having My Neighborhood Alice evolve.

Terrain

Here is a word you may not know: Obby. On the successful game platform Roblox, an Obby is
an obstacle course. They can be made without programming, by positioning items in a terrain.
This is a fantastic hit among players and content creators as well.

Similarly, even in the first version, creative individuals will be able to create their own mazes,
obstacle courses by building and making use of terrain features.

Community created events

Mazes, racetracks, dancehalls, parties. All these things can be done by the community in the
first version. You can make lotteries and competitions that require in-game assets to participate,
or you can ask for tickets to your events. There are opportunities for monetization here, just like
in the real world.

Programmer interface and scripting

We are exploring to make the game extensible by exposing an API to developers and
integrating a scripting language. This could open up creative possibilities for players within My
Neighbor Alice, as well as developers. By making an easy to use platform for development,
Roblox now has 345.000 developers on their platform.

A super simple programming language, focused on ease of use, with an in-game development
environment using familiar graphics. We want to go even further than Roblox simplifying the

experience.

We believe it can be a fantastic introduction to programming for millions of people.
Technology

System architecture

Game Core | Game Economy | Governance DAO

Chromia
Integrations
Game Core

Backend: Chromia

The first layer to this project is the game backend infrastructure. The project was created on the
fundamental idea that it will operate exclusively on the chromia platform, with a few exceptions
mentioned in this document.

The backend is a chromia relational blockchain database that is used in conjunction with Unity
to operate accounts, token transfers, relational data and user progress, among many other
things. It’s meant to follow the development of cross chain playability and interaction with NFT:s.
The unique database aspects of chromia gives the ability to do complex backend logic directly
on the blockchain without spending much development time.
20

Frontend: Unity

The second layer to the project is the client, developed in unity. The largest part is the
procedural building system. It's essential that it is fun, feels great and is on par with other
building games on the market.

Second biggest is the focus on gameplay loops and daily activities with player retention in
consideration. We also work on connecting the backend with frontend, login-registration edge
cases, and multiplayer scalability & stability.

Game Economy

The third area in the project is the economic infrastructure. “Property/Plot” auctioning, asset
trading, token transactions.

Backend: Chromia

Gaming, marketplace and auction logic is done on the Chromia blockchain

Frontend: Web and Unity

The frontend to marketplaces and auctions can be done as a web application embedded into
the game. Parts of the UX might also be done directly in Unity.

Integrations: ERC20 and Steam

The ALICE token will be transferable between ERC20 and native Chromia token. This bridge is
developed by Chromia outside of this project.

The Steam marketplace and sales there will have an integration code connecting to Chromia.

Governance DAO

This project will not only create a game, but code for a decentralized autonomous organisation
called Community Council.

The DAO implementation should be handed out to an external company, we identified
ChromaWay as the initial partner.
21

Backend: Chromia

Voting and rules of governance can be implemented in Chromia. Being a relational database,
this is comparatively easier than with other blockchains.

Frontend: Web
The DAO interface will be a web application, outside of the My Neighbor Alice game.

Integrations: Chromunity

The Chromunity"® project done by Chromia, is a forum with moderation and voting features.
Chromunity is also used by other projects such as the Hedget"' DeFI application. By integrating
the Chromunity open source code, developing the Community Council (DAO) will be easier.

Token model

ALICE Token

ALICE token is the native currency in the game. It allows token holders to play, invest and also
be part of the game. There is a fixed supply of ALICE tokens.

Token utilities

Payments ALICE is the game currency that players use to purchase assets and land in
the game.

DeFi Staking is a way to lend a currency, and receive interest in return. Token
holders could participate in staking and earn rewards as a certain percentage
of platform revenues will be given out as staking rewards.

For instance, the gaming platform would have revenues from plot sales, asset
sales, transaction fees etc. and that a fixed proportion would be distributed to
the staking pool.

NFT:s will also have DeFi features such as collateralization and buybacks (as
described in this document)

Governance | Owning Alice enables the player to participate in the governance process
through a decentralized organisation, with proposals and voting structures.
There are issues related to the platform operations and development that could

be decided based on the preference of the token holders. In order to
encourage users to participate in the voting process, there will also be rewards

Play to earn | There are a proportion of the tokens reserved for user incentives. By
completing quests in the game, players could earn ALICE tokens. This design
is to encourage user participation in the game and to maintain traction.

(Only used for
limited events)

During 0-24 months, the allocation of tokens is managed by the Alice Foundation, which
controls and issues (mints) token funds according to the schedule. The Foundation distributes

24

token funds among the following categories: staking rewards, play-to-earn, gaming, and other
sources foreseen by the token distribution model (Team and Advisors, Ecosystem, Reserve,
Community and Marketing, User incentive, Token sale, etc).

Revenue

Before the DAO is launched, all revenue will go to a special account which will lock the funds.
The DAO will manage revenues and spend it on game growth and development. With this
model DAO will be able to employ more developers to increase the market size. It will also
control how much funds will be locked. Initially at least 75% of net revenue (revenue minus
transaction and platform service fees) will be locked in reserves attached to land and NFT:s,
thus we expect that the TLV (Total Locked Value) to grow when more land, NFT:s and other
game assets are purchased.

Stage Il (24+ months)

The team will research and consult, both with experts and the community, deciding on the best
legal set up for the Community Council legal body to which it will hand the game “My neighbor
Alice’.

Players are incentivized to contribute to the game development by playing, inviting friends,
purchasing in-game items and so on. Thus, there are different ways to get rewarded.

DeFi component

Staking Yield and Earnings

One of our strategic visions within My Neighbor Alice is to create monetary incentives for the
most committed and motivated players.

Staking yield

Based on our staking and reward projections, we will allocate a fair amount of tokens on staking
rewards. This will incentivize stakers to hold their tokens during the early stage of the game
development while some significant game features will still be under development.

Staking will progressively decrease as new features will be released.

NFT collateral

When a user buys NFT from the system, a percentage of the purchase price might go into a
special collateral account associated with NFT. User then has an option to sell it back to the
system (i.e. destroy the NFT) for the price equivalent to the locked collateral (or a percentage of
it). This guarantees that the value of NFT cannot go below a certain threshold.

This feature will also allow a user to take a loan using NFT as a collateral.

Renting NFT:s

NFT:s, including land, can be rented to other players. The smart contract will make sure that the
borrower cannot resell or destroy the object, and makes sure that object returns to the owner
when the rent period ends.

Governance by the Players - Community Council

Introduction

In line with an exciting plot and “the cutest cows in the world”, “My neighbor Alice” also aims to
become a truly user-owned game with its own Decentralized organization called Community
Council governed by the community. Thus, we also integrated a concept of DAO, which over
time can take over the majority of decision-making powers within the game. Community Council
will be a crucial element of the game ecosystem which will address both in-game issues as well
as the proposals connected to game development and future funding.

Membership

In principle, every ALICE token holder can become a member of the Decentralised Organization
and get the right to vote on proposals. At the same time, we understand that a certain number of
players will be primarily interested in gaming and enjoying the “Alice world”. We respect their
decision, so membership in the Community Council will be optional.

Community Council principles

Designed as a consumer cooperative and a platform cooperative, the organization follows the
universal principles:
e Voluntary membership, i.e. membership in Community Council is optional and fully
depends on a player
e Democratic member control, i.e. Community Council has adopted liquid democracy as a
model of participation
e Autonomy and independence, i.e. Community Council is expected to overtake the
majority of in-game decision-making powers and stay free from third-party interference
and control
e Education and information, i.e. one of our key goals in game is to educate our players on
political and economic models that were inspired by a real world
e Community cooperation, i.e. many activities in game require a mutual effort, cooperation
and communication which makes the bonds between players even stronger
More information on the Community Council is available in the appendix.

Juridical entities

It is vital to be able to map the ideas around governance into proper legal frameworks and
structures, and clear responsibilities among participants in the ecosystem.

Antler Interactive

Antler Interactive is an interactive mobile game studio, located in central Stockholm, Sweden.
Established with the idea of making great games for new tech, we design games that introduce
players to new ways of interacting with emerging technologies. Conceived from and previously
28

known as SVRVIVE Studios, a pioneer in VR with globally best selling and award winning titles.
Antler Interactive is a revival of our passion for immersive experiences and a transition into a
focus on mobile tech and games. In 2019, ChromaWay acquired Antler Interactive in order to
stimulate blockchain gaming on Chromia.

Previous releases from Antler Interactive include SVRVIVE: The Deus Helix, Kartong - Death by
Cardboard, Krystal Kart AR, Krystopia: A Puzzle Journey, Krystopia and Nova’s Journey. In
addition Antler Interactive has completed a work-for-hire project with augmented reality in
collaboration with a Swedish well-known cruising company and have received two grants from
the Swedish Innovation Agency for an empathy project in gaming.

Partners

Chromia

Chroma is a decentralized public blockchain, a project started and maintained by ChromaWay.
The Chromia project aims to make blockchain performant and easy to use by users as well as
developers. The unique technical architecture,combining relational databases with blockchain,
is perfect for complex game design with logic on-chain.

ChromaWay

Is a true pioneer of blockchain. Already in 2012, the CTO of ChromaWay created the world's
first source code to issue user generated tokens. His “colored-coins” project 2012-2014 was
inspiration to many projects, and education for many that are now in our industry. Among the
people involved in the project were Esteban Ordano of Decentraland, and Vitalik Buterin of
Ethereum. ChromaWay moved away from the first colored-coins protocol apps on blockchain in
2014, such as a stable coin for LHV Bank, to do innovative new technologies for enterprises and
governments, which ultimately lead up to Chromia. Several known cases have been in
land-registration, with the Swedish state from 2016 to the InterAmerican Development Bank in
South America 2020. And now, with My Neighbor Alice, they take the step from real land to
imaginary land.

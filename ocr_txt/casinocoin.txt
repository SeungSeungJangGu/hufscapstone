A digital currency for the

regulated online gaming sector

What is CasinoCoin?

CasinoCoin is a digital currency, designed specifically for the regulated
online gaming industry. Utilising the latest in blockchain technology,
CasinoCoin can facilitate up 1,000 peer-to-peer transfers per second, with
near-instant confirmation.

Built with users, gaming operators and regulators in mind, the CasinoCoin
Bankroll Manager application features built in KYC capabilities, responsible
gaming options, and provides an unparalleled user experience never seen
before in the online gambling space.

Users will benefit from a simplified registration process that, once
completed, provides a seamless, secure and trustless online gaming
experience. All at a tiny fraction of the current cost and time.

Operators who integrate CasinoCoin into their gaming platform will
gain access to a simplified user onboarding process, a new incremental
revenue stream, and reduced fees associated with cross-border
transactions.

The nature of blockchain technology means that regulators will benefit
from the most secure and transparent funding system available today.
A near-perfect anti-money laundering (AML) environment has been
developed, utilising the latest KYC technology coupled with a new,
proprietary AML tracking tool; the most advanced and thorough in the
industry.

Built For Gambling

CasinoCoin is built with the
regulated gambling business in
mind, with tools like KYC (Know
Your Customer), AML (Anti-Money
Laundering) and responsible
gaming features built in at the
wallet level.

For Users

CasinoCoin gives the user
unprecedented speed, security, and
control over their gambling habits.
Transaction costs are a fraction of
typical costs today.

CasinoCoin gives operators access
to a largely untapped source of
players, who have been fully vetted
with clear KYC the instant they
arrive. Incremental revenue with
full visibility and security before a
single bet is placed.

For Regulators

Well over a million lines of

code went into the CasinoCoin
Blockchain and wallet - a modified
version of Ripple, the functional
crypto of choice for the banking
industry. Proprietary tools allow
regulators visibility into coin flow
in a way never before possible with
easy to use tools for non-crypto
users.

Ripple Technology

FUG

Ripple is a crypto protocol specially built for banks and to satisfy
financial regulators. There are already over 100 banks and other
financial institutions using or integrating Ripple into their processes
and plans.

Recent (Nov 2017) additions to the list of Ripple adopters include
Santander and American Express.

Ripple vs Bitcoin vs Ethereum

The Ripple protocol offers unparalleled transaction speed and cost in the
crypto space. The two largest and most well known digital currencies are
Bitcoin and Ethereum, yet Ripple arguably features better technology and is
perfectly suited for the real money online gambling industry.

NOTE

Although CasinoCoin uses the Ripple code, it operates on its own separate
blockchain. This means CSC will never be susceptible to network outages
that are common on Ethereum due to the amount of applications built on
top of the protocol, and that all share the same infrastructure.

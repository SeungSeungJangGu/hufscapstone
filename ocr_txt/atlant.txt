Intro

ATLANT Platform (hereinafter “ATLANT”) is building a next generation global real-estate platform
based on blockchain technology. We believe blockchain has the potential to help accelerate the
adoption of the Sharing Economy which has already begun to unleash industry disruption by
opening up significant amounts of previously untapped private capacity and tokenization of
property may completely change real estate transactions and ownership transfer as we know
them. That is why we are using the token crowdsale mechanism to pre-sell our product and
finance development as opposed to traditional venture capital. With a secure, tamper-proof
system based on the blockchain, users can trade parcels of property on our platform and bypass
intermediaries in rental deals, transacting P2P (peer-to-peer), all of which will enhance ease of
use and security for guests and hosts alike, streamlining user experience and driving accelerated

adoption.

Real Estate is the largest asset class in the world, and also one of the most inefficient. Our aim is
to empower the $217+ trillion? global real estate market with 2017 volume of $1.4 trillion? to
seek a more transparent and liquid way to invest and trade. ATLANT platform seeks to help
subdivide individual parcels of real estate into tokens, and subsequently PTO (Property Token
Offering) and list them on exchanges, starting with the decentralized ADEX exchange based on
Ethereum smart contracts. Such endeavor would ease transfer of ownership, simplify fractional
holding without minimal constraints, alleviate tax inefficiencies, make cross-border transactions
simple, and eliminate substantial overhead faced in certain jurisdictions due to unnecessary
middlemen. Tokenizing property will allow real estate assets to be uniquely identified via a digital
record that contains information regarding occupancy, physical characteristics, legal status,

historical performance, and financial position.

Investor-Intentions-Survey-2017

http://atlant.io | 2
Further, ATLANT addresses both the short- and long-term real estate rental markets by lowering
fees, using decentralized conflict resolution and making this market truly P2P, eliminating various
middlemen, and also ensuring that reviews and listings are honest, as they are stored on an

immutable blockchain.

ATLANT platform is being developed as an open source framework with respect to both rental
P2P network and tokenized property of assets, which continues to operate and trade on the
Ethereum network, independent of platform's contributors. ATLANT provides a clean UI, utilizing
EVM contracts under the hood. Additionally, ("ATL") platform tokens may be traded on

centralized digital asset exchanges as well.

Eventual moonshot goal of ATLANT, once government property registers are fully blockchain-
compliant and have distributed ledgers, is to partner with various jurisdictions to make buy and
sell transactions of smaller units feasible with integration into such registers without having to
first place real estate into incorporated SPVs. There are currently multiple blockchain real estate
registry pilot projects already in place specifically in Sweden, Georgia, Ghana, Ukraine, parts of

Japan and USA (Chicago, Delaware), while multiple other jurisdictions are examining blockchain-

enabled title registries.

http://atlant.io
Blockchain will entirely reshape the title insurance industry. By registering real estate on a
distributed ledger, blockchain could streamline the manually intensive practice of examining
public records when validating titles in real estate transactions. According to Goldman Sachs
estimates, blockchain driven property records could drive up to $4bn in cost savings due to

reductions in headcount and actuarial risk in the US alone.?

While blockchain technology is still in its infancy, and complete decentralized ledger of global
property is not going to happen overnight, ATLANT plans to take a leading role in all facets of real
estate globally to make this a reality, starting with disrupting the rental market and tokenizing
large real estate assets for trading. Please refer to our timeline below for detailed overview of

our current progress and future goals.

Abstract

In its current iteration, ATLANT provides two main features to address known problems in today’s

global real estate: Tokenized Ownership and Peer-to-Peer Rentals.

Tokenized ownership will simplify every type of operation with the real estate, including property
investments and ownership transfers, either partial or complete. Real estate tokens representing
a share in property ownership will allow for a liquid real estate market with transparent prices
(price discovery). Please note that ATL tokens are essentially membership certificates in the
ATLANT Platform, which give numerous rights and privileges to their owners provided
compliance with KYC/AML policies of ATLANT and proof of member activity confirmed by running
an ATLANT node on the member’s computer, as discussed in more detail later. There is no passive

expectation of income solely from holding ATL tokens.

Peer-to-Peer Rentals will make it possible to significantly reduce fees taken from both parties
(tenant and lessor) and minimize the possibility of fake reviews and forged ratings — which are
the main problems of existing centralized rental services such as Airbnb, Expedia, Booking and

others.

With advent of blockchain technology, existing hotel business and growth of online services such
as Booking and Airbnb could be disrupted and channeled into a decentralized service such as

ATLANT, and said technology could accelerate both supply growth and utilization. Under

conservative assumptions, (just for the US market) blockchain technology will provide explosive

growth to the lodging market (see Figure 4).

Figure 6. Future Projected RevPAR in the US Hotel Industry Attributable to Blockchain Technology

ATLANT operates as a custom decentralized system, governed by the DAO family built on

Ethereum. The platform is powered by its core token, abbreviated as “ATL”.

ATL tokens are essentially membership certificates in the ATLANT Platform, which give the
following rights and privileges to their owners provided compliance with KYC/AML policies of
ATLANT and proof of member activity confirmed by running an ATLANT node on the member’s

computer:

= Listing fee charged in ERC20 compliant property tokens, in all properties listed through
the ATLANT Platform during their initial property token offerings. The platform enables
property owners and developers to tokenize property by creating customized smart
contracts and perform a token distribution to either sell property (partially or completely)
or attract financing for its construction. The size of the listing fee is initially set at 7% of
the underlying asset and, subsequently, determined by voting of the ATL token holders.

After a successful token sale, an agreed part of the property tokens is released out of

htt

/atlant.io
ATLANT escrow to ATL token holders proportionately, provided such ATL token holders
are running an ATLANT node on their computers. There is no passive expectation of
income solely from holding ATL tokens.

= Commissions from P2P rentals are imposed on the lessor, as a small fee, once a
transaction with the lessee is finalized. These commissions are distributed to the ATL
token holders running an ATLANT node on their computer. The size of this fee is
determined by voting of the ATL token holders.

= Votes to decide various actions taken with respect to the property: platform listing
decision, listing fee approval, law firm choice, management company choice (property
tokenization), property for rent approval, rental fee approval.

= Ability to work, and earn extra income, within the framework of ATLANT as an arbiter for
conflict resolution in P2P rentals, moderated via an arbiter rating system. As a result of
this work funds withheld from the escrow of the losing party are distributed to the ATL
token holder who performed the arbitration.

= Influence on the platform and ability to propose, vote on and aid further developments
to improve the efficiency of real estate globally, as well as boost ATLANT’s global adoption

and growth.

Token holders agree upon every decision taken within the platform, affecting both tokenizing
property and P2P rental service, by the use of a voting mechanism. ATL token holders vote for or
against the proposals created by most reputable holders, covering all activities within the

platform.

Blockchain — Quick Review

Blockchain is fundamentally a new type of database technology that is optimized to tackle a
unique set of challenges. Historically, databases have been used as central data repositories by
organizations to support transaction processing and computation. However, databases are rarely
shared between organizations due to a variety of technology and security concerns. Blockchain

is a shared, distributed database of transactions among parties that is designed to increase

http://atlant.io | 9
transparency, security, and efficiency. Blockchain is a database (with copies of the database
replicated across multiple locations or nodes) of transactions (between two or more parties) split
into blocks (with each block containing details of the transaction such as the seller, the buyer,
the price, the contract terms, and other relevant details) which are validated by the entire
network via encryption by combining the common transaction details with the unique signatures
of two or more parties. The transaction is valid if the result of the encoding is the same for all
nodes and added to the chain of prior transactions (as long as the block is validated). If the block

is invalid, a “consensus” of nodes will correct the result in the non-conforming node.

The blockchain ledger is replicated across multiple locations (we show just six in Figure 7 for
simplicity), and each maintains its own copy, which is separately updated based on new
transaction data. We show a sequence of three transactions. In the first two transactions, data
and signature information are properly validated by all six nodes with matching “hash” values.
However, for Transaction #3 at Location #5, the hash does not match the others, and will be

corrected by the others via “consensus.”

Figure 7. Example of Blockchain Ledger Transactions

Blockchain has the following advantages over a conventional centralized database:

http://atlant.io | 10 |
=" Security: Blockchain relies on encryption to validate transactions by verifying the
identities of parties involved in a transaction. This ensures that a “false” transaction
cannot be added to the blockchain without the consent of the parties involved. A complex
mathematical calculation known as a “hash” is performed each time a transaction is
added to the blockchain, which depends on the transaction data, the identities of the
parties involved in the transaction, and the result of previous transactions. The fact that
the current state of the blockchain depends on previous transactions ensures that a
malicious actor cannot alter past transactions. This is because if previous transaction data
is changed, it will impact the current value of the hash and not match other copies of the
ledger.

= Transparency: By its very nature, blockchain is a distributed database that is maintained
and synchronized among multiple nodes — for example, by multiple counterparties who
transact with each other frequently. In addition, transaction data must be consistent
between parties in order to be added to the blockchain in the first place. This means that
by design, multiple parties can access the same data (in some cases locally within their
organizations) — thus significantly increasing the level of transparency relative to
conventional systems that might depend on multiple “siloed” databases behind firewalls
that are not visible outside a single organization.

= Efficiency: Conceptually, maintaining multiple copies of a database with blockchain would
not appear to be more efficient than a single, centralized database. However, in most
real-world examples (including several of the case studies we examined in capital
markets), multiple parties already maintain duplicate databases containing information
about the same transactions. In many cases, the data pertaining to the same transaction
is in conflict — resulting in the need for costly, time-consuming reconciliation procedures
between organizations. Employing a distributed database system such as blockchain
across organizations can substantially reduce the need for manual reconciliation, thus

driving considerable savings. In addition, in some cases blockchain offers the potential for

http://atlant.io | an |
organizations to develop common or “mutual” capabilities that eliminate the need for

duplication of the same effort across multiple organizations.*

Problem — Buying & Selling Property

Real estate throughout time and to this day remains the greatest source of wealth for most
families, in fact, it is the largest asset class globally. History tells us that more great fortunes have
been made and lost in this asset class than any other. However, despite having a tremendous size
($217tn) and volume ($1.4tn), it remains one of the most inefficient of assets. Over time, various
attempts have been made to make this market more manageable and liquid, nonetheless every
individual or institution which buys and owns real estate faces nontransparent transaction costs,
asymmetric information, property rights opaqueness, variability in taxes, and a host of other

issues.

Efficient Market Hypothesis Theory states that the price of a security at any given time reflects
all of the available pertinent information. While there may be appropriate application for this
theory relative to exchange tradable assets such as stocks and bonds, it is currently inapplicable
relative to real estate. While over the long term pools of real estate might be relatively price-
efficient, purchases of a particular property are often driven by individual circumstances and

done with imperfect information, and limited number of buyers.

Most real estate ownership globally is single ownership, or at most divided between just a few
parties. This creates a problem as rising prices have outpaced consumer income and savings and
have left ability to purchase real estate assets to just a small subset of the population. Further,
high transaction costs and inefficiency in transactions themselves make redistribution of this
market sub-optimal. Frequently, the cost of moving from an overly large house into a smaller one

outweighs the savings and vice versa.

Practice

Also, investing in real estate for most individuals and corporations typically lacks any global reach
as paperwork, due diligence and administration in a foreign jurisdiction involves knowledge and

prohibitive costs.

Solution — Buying & Selling Property

ATLANT is the first decentralized real estate platform, built on top of the Ethereum network. With
rapid rate of adaption of crypto-assets, ATLANT strives to remedy the situation of illiquidity and
opaqueness in the real estate market. ATLANT serves as a turnkey solution for listing a real estate
asset for trading in a tokenized form in a similar way that stocks are listed on exchanges such as

FTSE or DAX.

Figure 8. Property Token Trading Platform Preview
ATL token holders, being the platform’s members, work to find property owners or developers
willing to sell their property assets or a part of their development to raise funds for the

construction. Decentralized voting is performed with the use of EVM smart contracts to either

http://atlant.io ea
accept or reject a new listing. In case a new property is approved to list on the platform, ATL

holders vote for the property’s law firm and management company.

Approved lawyer, or competent local authority in each respective jurisdiction, verifies legal
documentation provided by the listing party and digitally signs each document pertaining to the
property. Once signed by the local authority, each document is hashed and pushed into the
ATLANT Distributed Data Store (“ADDS”), while its hash is recorded in the Ethereum blockchain.
This ensures that documents become immutable and virtually impossible to forge, as any change
made inside an ADDS document will lead to a different hashing result, which would differ from
the hash previously recorded in the Ethereum blockchain. By applying this operation to every
item stored in ADDS, we create a permanent link to every document from the tamper-proof
blockchain. As sometimes documents need to be updated legally, we use ADDS versioning

provided by the IPFS protocol?.

Once all decisions covering a new listing are made, ATL holders verify both a Ricardian contract
(RC)§ and EVM contract created by a listing party. Ricardian contract is digitally signed and linked
to the corresponding EVM smart contract, making the contract legally binding. Ricardian
contracts are stored in ADDS. The final step of the process involves voting for the deployment of
EVM smart contract into the Ethereum network, which effectively enacts the start of property
tokenization. Property tokens are issued by the EVM contract in exchange for ETH and ERC20
tokens. Once initial property token distribution is finalized, ATL token holders who have carried
out work of running an ATLANT node to secure the ATLANT network, receive a listing fee charged
in property tokens, which are ERC20 compliant. Tokens raised from the proceeds of the sale are
subsequently released from ATL escrow to the selling party in case of a successful sale

(determined by the contract).

Subsequently, the tokenized property trades with bids and offers with order matching to create
a state of equilibrium, reflecting true value of the property at a given time. ATLANT provides a
decentralized exchange service (“ADEX”) to facilitate trading of both platform tokens and
property tokens. Trading is done in a decentralized way with the use of Ethereum exchange

contracts TokenTrader’ and Maker-OTC®.

Liquidity and true price of the asset which this system attempts to create, enable market
participants to resolve many problems which currently make the market inefficient. Examples of
this are collateral management for real estate assets in a dynamic price environment, as value of
collateral can be easily determined, and collateral itself can be transferred via other blockchains.
Further, store of wealth and inheritance can be easily written into smart contract so that there’s

no probate disputes.

Additionally, platform tokens (“ATL”) can be tradable at existing centralized exchanges after the

end of the contribution period.

Problem — High Rental Middleman Fees & Fake Reviews
In the past decade, long-term property rental as well as short-term vacation rentals have become
substantially more accessible with various online platforms, so much so that they have put

pressure on the hotel market.

Figure 10. Dynamics of P2P Lodging Usage
With the popularity of sharing economy, which is based on the idea of a direct relationship
between the host and tenant, the startups in the rental sphere are gaining popularity. However,
currently P2P economy is not fully implemented, because there remains a middleman in the form
of a booking service or agent which takes the role of a guarantor and arbitrator in resolving

disputes and nonstandard situations.

Our research indicates that the world’s leading short-term rental marketplaces, such as Airbnb
charge a service fee of up to 12% from the guest and 3% from the host, largely to compensate its
3500+ employees who process transactions in a centralized fashion. Similarly, hotel marketplaces
such as Booking and Expedia charge their affiliate hotels a range of 15-30%, depending on

location, for each booking deducted from the notional amount of each transaction.

Reviews and description and quality of amenities in rental properties on such platforms as Airbnb
and Booking are collected by a proprietary nontransparent internal database, leading to potential
abuse of the system, via changing/deleting of reviews, or host self-rating. A Consumer Reports
study of online ratings services criticized centralized reviews as businesses could reach out to
customers and convince them to change negative reviews for positive ones, offering refunds or

making other amends.

Solution — Eliminating the High Rental Middleman Fees & Fake Reviews

Although P2P lodging is already on a steep growth trajectory, in terms of both market awareness
and adoption, we see an opportunity for blockchain to increase volume, safety, quality, and
effectiveness of the transaction process. High transaction costs and safety concerns remain
significant challenges to the adoption of P2P lodging, and are areas where we see potential for

blockchain technology to disrupt the existing framework.

Airbnb continues to see strong growth, which P2P lodging site penetration is on the rise

Figure 11. Projected Growth of P2P Lodging with Blockchain
We created a decentralized solution to the aforementioned problem of short- and long-term
rentals as well as hotel bookings, allowing for reduction of commissions and true ratings. Peer-
to-peer rental service offered by the ATLANT relies on three main protective mechanisms:
escrow, reputation system and decentralized arbitration. All of these approaches are

implemented in existing decentralized exchange services and proved to be viable.

Any lessor may get listed on the platform by providing a real-world identity and sending a security
deposit into the escrow contract provided by the platform. This is a protective measure against
rental listing spam and ADDS bloating. Initially, lessor creates both Ricardian and EVM contracts
by means of ATLANT software, which are then automatically interlinked and deployed in ADDS
(Ricardian) and Ethereum (EVM contract). Lessor’s real-world identity is located inside of the

Ricardian contract stored in ADDS. Once the smart contract is deployed, the lessor sends a

http://atlant.io | a8 |
security deposit to the appropriate smart contract, which acts as an escrow and discourages

possible dishonest behavior of the lessor.

Conflict Resolution

Figure 12. ATLANT P2P Rental System
Platform’s approach towards identities gives tenants full control over their own privacy. While
they are encouraged to complete profiles fully, it is possible to have a pseudonymous identity or
decide to subsequently reveal identity to lessor or arbiter (e.g. via Keybase’). Lessors are required

to provide real-world identities in order to get listed as a host. Considering other entities on the

° Keybase open source security app http://keybase.io/docs

http://atlant.io | 19 |
platform, we share the approach of the Aragon’? project towards identity in the decentralized

network:

= Identity is opt-in. Entities are free to transact pseudonymously.

= Entities are free to choose how they want to identify themselves, and what identity
providers they consider valid to identify others.

= Identity belongs to the individual or organization, which means that the only entity which
can provide the ultimate truth about their identity is themselves or entities they

personally appoint for this (through cryptographic proofs).

Reputation system in the platform is essentially a decentralized rating and review system, where
reputation refers to the overall trustworthiness of an identity within a network. Decentralized

reputation approach has the following major considerations:

"Sybil attacks" - fake ratings made by an attacker using sockpuppet identities

= Distributed storage - ratings must be persistent, publicly accessible and immutable

Sybil attacks can generally be mitigated by increasing the cost in resources or time to perform an
action. Proof of transaction from tenant to lessor is required to leave a review and change lessor’s
rating. As described above, a transaction from a tenant to a host implies a small fee, which is
automatically paid to ATL token holders running an ATLANT node on their computer by the EVM
contract. In addition to benefiting the platform token holders, this fee serves as a guard against
fake reviews and forged ratings. As an additional protective mechanism, ATL holders may vote
on a proposal to impose a fine on an unscrupulous host, which is paid from lessor’s escrow

security deposit.

ATLANT utilizes its distributed data store ADDS to solve problems of rating persistence and

accessibility, while Ethereum blockchain is used for timestamping and securing data, which

10 Aragon Network: Digital Jurisdiction http://aragon.one
4 Sybil Attack, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack

http://atlant.io | 20 |
enforces rating immutability. Transactions stored in the blockchain contain IPFS links to ratings

stored in ADDS.

Reputation is tied to the transacting entity within the ATLANT network, which can be either
pseudonymous or self-identified. Rating is defined as the quality of the apartment for rent, which
is essentially an overall score of a counterparty. Every rating score sent to the network by the
tenant affects the rating of the host. Review is a written summary of the rental experience with
a particular host. Ratings and reviews are made on a per transaction basis as the network’s
protection measure involves a proof-of-transaction approach. As the unscrupulous host may
circumvent this protective mechanism by creating numerous pseudonymous entities and
conducting small transactions to give him/herself a positive rating, the Platform allows ATL token
holders to penalize this behavior, which is done by means of voting on appropriate proposals

affecting the lessor’s security deposit.

Rating score is a basic unit of reputation change, which could be either positive or negative.
Review is optional and may complement a rating score at the discretion of the lessee. Technically,
both the rating score and the review are assembled in a single object (score object) and pushed
into the ADDS upon rating score creation. Score object is directly linked to the payment
transaction from tenant to lessor, while its hash is recorded in the Ethereum blockchain to
guarantee rating score’s counterfeit protection. Generic score object reflecting a rating score and

an optional review at the ATLANT Platform comprises the following data fields:

1. Identity of the host within the network

2. Rating score to influence lessor’s overall rating
a. -1: Negative rating
b. 0: Neutral rating
c. 1: Positive rating

3. Customer experience (optional review)

4. Customer identity (pseudonym)

5. Timestamp

http://atlant.io | 21 |
Network protocol ensures that score objects are stored decentrally in such a way that while every
node has these objects in its local ADDS, nobody can modify ratings already created by other

network identities.

Blockchain bloat is a common issue in decentralized rating storage systems. ATLANT network
takes protective measures against this, and relies on its own distributed data store built on top
of open-source IPFS software. Furthermore, data store bloat has the potential to become an issue
for the network thus certain restrictions are imposed on the score object’s size to mitigate this

threat.

ATLANT uses decentralized arbitration for conflict resolution, a model which has already been
successfully applied in practice by Bitcoin based companies Bitsquare’* and OpenBazaar*>. This
eliminates the need for a centralized authority such as Airbnb to perform conflict resolution. Rent
price is not initially affected by possible conflict resolution costs in the future because arbiter fee
is only taken from the losing party, in case of an arbitration, and once it is finished. We use smart
contracts based escrow to lock security deposits of both parties (tenant and lessor) until their

transaction is finalized.

Figure 13. P2P Rental Service on the Blockchain
ATLANT Platform implements a reputation-based arbitration system, which involves two types
of arbitrator roles: a regular arbiter and a senior arbiter. Security deposits of both parties (tenant
and lessor) are required to be sent to the rental smart contract prior to the actual money transfer.
Arbitration logic is subsequently handled by the EVM rental contract. Arbiters are governed by
the special arbitration contract, which requires a security deposit prior to working as an arbiter.
This security deposit is automatically returned in whole to the arbitrator upon stepping down

from arbitration.

Reputation system is protected against Sybil attacks and other attack vectors applicable to
decentralized networks by means of proof-of-transaction and small transaction fees (similar to
ones utilized in Bitcoin). Both roles, of arbiter and a senior arbiter are supported in case of a high
rating score. The ATLANT protocol assigns an appropriate arbiter and a senior arbiter
automatically to transactions requiring conflict resolution. In case of a dispute security deposits
are used as payment for dispute resolution efforts. Arbiters gets paid from the losing party’s

security deposit upon completion of an active arbitration process.

The arbitration process entails several phases. In order to determine the winning party, an arbiter

requests both the tenant and lessor to deliver specific proofs: real-world ID, hand-signed

http://atlant.io | 23 |
documents and evidence-containing footage pertaining to any issues. Then, the arbitrator
renders their decision based on presented evidence, which means that the winning party does
not lose anything, while the losing party is penalized by the system as its security deposit is

transferred to the arbiter.

If either party is not satisfied with the decision of the arbitrator, final arbitration round may be
requested, which involves a senior arbiter. A senior arbiter is chosen by the protocol from a list
of top-rated arbiters. The senior arbiter reviews evidence provided and renders a final decision.
If the initial arbiter is found to have behaved dishonestly, further steps are taken to penalize this

behavior, based on severity, typically impacting the regular arbiter’s escrowed deposit.

Tokenization and Listing for Trading of Properties

Property Inventory and Sourcing

ATLANT allows property owners and developers to tokenize their assets and list them for trading.
ATLANT token holders will endeavor to find new properties and also accept incoming requests
from such entities. Initially ATLANT plans to tokenize properties in select transparent jurisdictions
such as continental Europe and UK, and eventually, as our expertise grows expand globally to
capture further market share. Sourcing and diligence for each jurisdiction will be done in
accordance with existing laws and procedures in each jurisdiction. ATLANT is developing a
framework for each country which will be implemented and verified on the blockchain via digital

signatures by respective local authorities.

Property Token Offering

Once a property has been identified and verified by local authorities, and its details published on
the platform, a date will be set for the properties’ Property Token Offering (“PTO”). Price for the
listing offer will be taken from the developer or selling party. Lawyers/trust companies who

digitally signed all certificates and will be handling transfer of ownership are involved off the

http://atlant.io | 24 |
chain with ATLANT supervising the process. All requisite documentation and offering documents
will be published on ATLANT for prospective PTO holders to assess the property for potential
purchase. Subscription will be handled via smart contracts and aggregated into a fund which will
be collected via ATLANT escrow from the start of the PTO until expiry date set at the start of the
process. If during this time period the fund has not reached capacity, ATLANT escrow will release
tokens back to the addresses of the token holders. Should the fund reach capacity set forth by
the seller, funds will be sent to the seller and PTO tokens will be distributed to the token holders
of the property. Subsequently PTO tokens will be listed for trading on exchanges, starting from
the decentralized ADEX exchange to increase liquidity and price discovery of the tokenized real

estate asset.

Rental Income

The main recurring income as with traditional property holdings is rental income. It is the duty of
the property management company to collect this income and redistribute it to token holders.
Rental income is distributed automatically by using the property contract functionality, allowing
for redistribution of funds in any ERC20 compliant token or ETH to platform token holders

proportionately to their PTO holdings on the ATLANT Platform.

Rental income is distributed to the property token holders after fees are deducted by the
management company, and the reserve fund is topped off should it be less than 10% of the
property price for the past 6 months of trading, or initial price of the PTO if 6 months has not

elapsed.

Reserve Fund

During the PTO of a real estate asset, a 10% reserve fund will be created and held in the EVM
smart contract escrow of the property DAO, or child DAO. The reserve fund is proportional
property of the asset’s token holders, however it is held in escrow, to pay the management

company and cover any unexpected costs associated with the property. In the secondary market

http://atlant.io | 25 |
when property tokens are trading, while the reserve fund itself will not be transferred from the
seller to the buyer during trading, price of the tokens will imply the reserve component in their
price. This is true due to the fact that if the property is completely sold, in the event of a buyout
or squeeze out, the reserve fund will be liquidated, and proceeds distributed to former token

holders pro-rata.

Services which will be covered by the reserve fund are structuring fees, escrow fees, property
maintenance and repair fees, property management fees, property tax on rental income,
insurance fees, property renovation fees, legal costs, and any other auxiliary expenses born by
the management company in servicing the asset. The property management company has
discretion over the reserve fund for day to day expenditures, in the event that single proposed
expenditure does not exceed 3% of the value of average of 6 months trading price of the asset
or initial price of the PTO if 6 months has not passed elapsed. Expenses which exceed this

threshold are voted on by PTO holders.

Due to current cryptocurrency volatility reserve fund assets will be automatically converted, via
a smart contract, to fiat-like currency via Tether“ upon entering the reserve fund. The reason for
this is that spending associated with the reserve fund is closely associated with fiat currencies.
Funds from the reserve fund will be paid as necessary to the management company, which would
be controlled by the use of a voting system (choice of the management company). The
management company will have access to the reserve fund, however possibility of embezzlement
will be minimized via the ATLANT Platform, by tracking the transactions made by the
management company in a real-time and by voting on proposals to choose a different

management company.

Reserve Fund Drawdown Provision
In the event that the reserve fund is drawn down to 2% of average 6 months trading price, or

initial price of the PTO if 6 months has not elapsed, and is not replenished in time by proceeds

“4 Tether Digital Currency, http://tether.to

http://atlant.io | 26 |
from rent, liquidation of the property will commence. Property token holders will vote on a listing
broker/public marketplace and upon sale of the property, proceeds of the sale and the reserve
fund minus applicable brokerage commissions will be proportionally distributed among PTO

token holders.

Duties of the Management Company

Property management company is responsible for:

= Setting the initial rent level, collecting rent from tenants and adjusting the rent. They are
also responsible for finding and screening tenants, handling security deposits, managing
tenant complaints/emergencies, handling leases, move-outs, complying with property
safety standards, and dealing with and initiating evictions.

= Physical management of the property, including regular maintenance and emergency
repairs. They are in charge of, or must hire someone to perform such task as
extermination, checking for leaks, landscaping, shoveling of snow and removal of trash.
This maintenance aims to keep current tenants happy and attract new tenants. They must
also perform repairs when there is an issue, or must hire someone to attend to it.

=" Operating within the set budget for the building. In certain emergency situations when
the occupants (tenants) or physical structure (investment property) are in danger, they
may use their discretion to order repairs or likewise without concern for the budget.

=" Keeping thorough records regarding the property. This should include all income and
expenses; list of all inspections, signed leases, maintenance requests, any complaints,
records of repairs, costs of repairs, maintenance costs, record of rent collection and
insurance costs. All of these records and actions will be logged/recorded on the
blockchain.

= Filing and paying taxes for the property and its rental income for which funds will come

from the reserve fund.

http://atlant.io | 27 |
Change of Management Company

Every year, property token holders will vote whether to keep or change the property
management company. If more than 50% of token holders vote to change the management
company, a proposal will be put forth to token holders to select a licensed management company

from a list of proposed locally respected providers.

Buyout or Purchase of Significant Stake

Similar to fiat exchanges any token holder may propose to buy out the property in its entirety or
purchase a significant stake of the tokens. This will enact a smart contract voting mechanism
whereby token holders will vote to accept or reject the price offered to them. A threshold of 95%
of token holders is necessary for mandatory buyout procedure to take place. In this event the
acquirer will receive 100% of all tokens, in exchange for ETH which will be distributed pro rata
among former token holders. In the event that the acquirer chooses to buy a significant stake
and not purchase the property entirely, token holders will be able to tender their tokens at the

proposed price.

Delisting/Buyout of the Property

In the event that a majority token holder acquires 90% or greater position in the asset, a squeeze-
out clause may be enacted, by this token holder, whereby reaming token holders will be bought
out at the average price of 6 month of trading, or initial price of the PTO if 6 months has not

elapsed.

Details of Property Offerings

ATLANT has specific requirement and process for listing PTOs which involves the following:

1. Listing of technical and legal documentation of the real estate asset on ATLANT sufficient

for ownership transfer in said jurisdiction.

http://atlant.io | 28 |
2. Real estate asset must meet listing requirements of the platform which are currently
defined as estimated value of €20,000,000 or greater, and having a holding structure
which is absent of liens. This limit is imposed initially during the pilot of the ATLANT
Platform and will be further refined by ATL token holder voting. Subsequently ATL token
holders will be able to vote to modify this value in general, or on a case-per-case basis.

3. ATL token holders will vote on the competent legal entity which will verify validity of the
transaction and property in respective jurisdiction.

4. In the event that the law firm or competent authority in the property’s jurisdiction
renders a positive decision, with respect to the holding structure, and ownership of the
asset, the PTO will be generated with the number of tokens equal to the square
millimeters of the asset.

5. ATLANT acts as an escrow of ETH or BTC which are sent by subscribers during the initial
PTO of the asset. Subsequently, after the asset is inserted into a Special Purpose Vehicle
(SPV) structure and tokenized, escrow assets are released to the seller of the real estate
asset.

6. Listing fee equal to 7% of the newly issued PTO tokens are retained by ATL Platform, and
distributed pro rata to ATL token holders who have gone through KYC/AML and have done
work as an active node on the ATLANT platform. Future listing fee levels will be voted on
by the ATL Platform token holders.

7. Reserve/insurance fund is created for every PTO. This fund remains the property of each
token holder, however it is escrowed in the event that the SPV which owns the property
needs to spend funds on the management company, lawyer fees or other unforeseen
circumstances.

8. After the PTO takes place, tokens of the asset are listed and trade freely on the ATLANT

platform.

Trading of Tokenized Assets

ATLANT codebase includes ADEX (decentralized exchange) EVM smart contracts to allow for a

safe and secure method of exchange between Platform tokens (“ATL”) and property tokens (e.g.

http://atlant.io | 29 |
“ATLAXXX”). Ether and other ERC20 tokens may also be exchanged for property tokens on the

decentralized ADEX exchange.

Exchanging tokens by means of this model reduces a number of risks associated with traditional
centralized exchanges — e.g. a risk of failure to fulfill its obligations to customers. Nevertheless, it
is possible for some part of the tokens to be tradeable at centralized digital currency exchanges
as well. From an economic point of view, there is an incentive for both ATL token holders and

property token holders to contribute to tokens being traded at centralized exchanges.

Tokens are traded via a traditional two-sided market consisting of bids and offers. If there are
more buyers or sellers the market mechanism will move the token price, and thus the market
capitalization of the asset, to a clearing level in accordance with the market’s assessment of the

property value.

Technology

Overview

In terms of technology, ATLANT Platform is a standalone P2P network with the custom protocol
built for purposes of digitizing real estate in a decentralized way. This network is governed by
Ethereum smart contracts (ATLANT DAO family), implementing and enforcing rules for entities

to interact in tokenizing property or rentals.

ATLANT uses a list of technological concepts to implement the model described above.

Ethereum platform with its virtual machine (EVM) is by now the most established blockchain-
based distributed computing platform with smart contract functionality. It powers both

tokenization and contracting aspects of the ATLANT Platform.

The platform implements its own protocol, responsible for data distribution and mirroring,
historic versioning of documents, distributed data storage, arbitration and reputation in the
decentralized network. The rest is implemented in the form of Ethereum smart contracts and
executed by EVM: DAO family, voting on proposals, escrow, core and property tokens, rental
agreements and auxiliary contracts. The ATLANT protocol provides a bridge, connecting the
ATLANT network with the Ethereum-based smart contract infrastructure governing the ATLANT

Platform.

ATLANT Technology Stack

ATLANT Platform software components are being developed using the following stack:

= Go

= Solidity

= JavaScript
= Electron

= EthereumJS

= web3.js
= Vue.js
= IPFS

We apply appropriate technology in accordance with the tasks to be accomplished.

Our core node software which is doing the heavy-lifting is written in Golang and utilizes a

modified IPFS node.

http://atlant.io | 32 |
Smart contract family is written in the Solidity language native to the Ethereum platform.
Ethereum was chosen as the most trustworthy environment for execution of Turing complete

smart contracts.

The desktop client is made with Electron framework, using JavaScript and helper libraries to work

with EVM contracts, and communicates with the core node running the ATLANT network.

Web client development is among our top priorities because it simplifies working with the
ATLANT Platform and will ultimately contribute to mass adoption of said platform. It is built with

the VuelS frontend framework.

ATLANT Software Components

ATLANT Platform comprises the following software components:

= atlant-go (Go)

= atlant-desktop (Electron)
= atlant-dao (Solidity)

= atlant-web (Vue.js)

= go-ipfs (forked)

"  go-onion-transport

ATLANT core node software is the low-level component, containing implementation of the
ATLANT protocol (atlant-go). Core node software is responsible for running the ATLANT P2P
network and managing data flow through, establishing the data tier of the ATLANT Platform. Core
node utilizes a modified IPFS node, which is capable of historic versioning, mirroring and reliable
data distribution across the ATL network. ATL node handles several data structures, including
property documents, arbiter registry, ratings and reviews data, peer identities, Ricardian
contracts. Node software contains an implementation of ADDS, which is built on top of IPFS to

provide a reliable way of distributed data storage. The atlant-go component utilizes go-ipfs and

45 Turing Completeness, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness

http://atlant.io | 33 |
go-onion-transport for the purposes of data distribution. We have selected the IPFS protocol due
to its principles of decentralization and support for data encryption and historic versioning

(similar to git).

Desktop client communicates directly to the ATLANT node and represents the presentation tier
of the ATLANT Platform. It interacts with the Ethereum network directly and contains a contract
creation toolset. Depending on the user role (e.g. host), the client offers a set of ready-to-use
contract templates and additionally a smart contracts designer. Once the contract is created, the
client provides it in two versions: Ricardian contract and the EVM contract. Users is requested to
digitally sign the Ricardian version of the contract in order to proceed with its deployment. Once
the Ricardian contract is signed, desktop client interlinks it with the EVM contract, hashes the
whole contract and creates the Ethereum transaction containing the Ricardian contract hash
digest. Once the transaction gets broadcasted and subsequently confirmed, desktop client passes
the signed Ricardian contract to the node, which in turn inserts it into the ADDS. The client
supports several roles, including property developer, tenant and arbiter. It has a built-in wallet
dedicated for storage and use of the platform tokens (ATL), property tokens and Ether. Voting on
proposals is available for ATL token holders and property token holders. Opt-in identity

management is supported (via Keybase and in the future, other identity providers).

Web client shares the functionality of the atlant-desktop component, but communicates with
remote ATLANT nodes for complete functionality. Although this approach harms decentralization
in the short term, we believe it will lead to global adoption and fast-paced growth of the ATLANT
Platform. Independent nodes will continue to operate as standalone applications powering the

ATL network even after the full-featured release of platform’s web version.

DAO component (atlant-dao) comprises a set of EVM smart contracts written in Solidity. These
contracts govern core platform changes, property tokenization, token exchange and peer-to-
peer rentals by creating a business logic tier. This is a high-level component, forming a framework
of self-enforcing agreements between multiple parties in the field of real estate. Some examples
are smart contracts in the atlant-dao component which regulate and enforce agreements

between the platform DAO and lessors, property token holders and the management company,

http://atlant.io | 34
the platform DAO and property DAOs, tenants and lessors. Further, a special ADEX contract

establishes a decentralized exchange of the platform tokens, property tokens and Ether.

Ricardian Contracts
The Ricardian contract is a method of recording a document as a contract at law, and linking it
securely to other systems, such as the accounting system, for the contract as an issuance of

value?®,

RC is a software design pattern to digitize documents and have them participate within financial
transactions, such as payments, without losing any of the richness of the contracting tradition.
Publication of the content and reference to that content by the unique cryptographic message

digest eliminates frauds based on multiple presentations.

The final goal of the Ricardian contract is to make the contract’s format both machine readable,
such that they can easily be extracted for computational purposes, and readable as an ordinary
text document such that lawyers and contracting parties may read the essentials of the contract

conveniently?’.

Technically, Ricardian contract is a digitally signed and cryptographically verified electronic
document that records an agreement between multiple parties, formatted to be human and
machine-readable (e.g. JSON format’). By applying a cryptographic hash function (one-way
hashing) to the RC, we receive the Ricardian contract digest as an output, which is immediately
recorded into the blockchain. This eliminates possibility of forging the RC, as any change to its
data would completely change an overall Ricardian contract digest. World’s most established
blockchains Bitcoin and Ethereum guarantee that any Ricardian contract digest would remain

unchanged once the transaction containing that digest is included into the blockchain block. In

order to be recognized as a valid RC, contract’s digest should match the one stored in the
blockchain. This ensures that none of counterparties are able to amend the terms of agreements
retroactively, eliminating potential disputes that may arise from hearsay claims between

counterparties.

At ATLANT, we use Ricardian contracts in addition to EVM contracts to ensure that smart
contracts have a legal force. This is implemented by using both the Ethereum blockchain and
ATLANT distributed data store. We have applied the principles described above and extended

them as follows:

= Every deployed EVM contract has a corresponding Ricardian contract (interlinked by
pointing at each other’s unique IDs)

= Every Ricardian contract linked to an EVM contract is stored in ADDS

= Every Ricardian contract stored in ADDS has its Ricardian contract digest stored in the

Ethereum blockchain

This approach ensures that one cannot forge a smart contract address inside the RC, as this

change would prevent the Ricardian contract from being recognized as a valid contract.

Ricardian contracts used by the ATLANT Platform are legally binding contracts, the terms of which
will be unequivocally interpreted by courts of law. Digitally signed and cryptographically verified,

these RCs point to corresponding EVM contracts, which ensure the implementation of

agreements at the application level.

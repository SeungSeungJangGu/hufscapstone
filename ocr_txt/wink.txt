Introduction to WINk

Drawing comparisons to the meteoric rise of the modern web, blockchain technology has
shown signs of tremendous growth potential and transformative power. Just as the
internet needed Web 2.0 to engage users with more social, usable, and interoperable
functionality, blockchain technology's path to mass adoption hinges upon creating a
seamless user experience. While the industry is still young and the potential of
decentralized applications remains largely untapped, the WINk is positioned to spark
Web 3.0 on the TRON network with its revolutionary DApp experiences.

With its emphasis on high throughput and low transaction costs, the TRON protocol will
allow WINk to facilitate widespread adoption of blockchain technology through consumer
use cases. TRONbet was the first DApp ever launched on TRON and has become the
leading application in terms of both user numbers and transaction volume across all major
blockchains. Despite numerous competitors entering the market, TRONbet has remained
on the cutting edge of blockchain gaming because of its superior product and commitment
to the community.

The gaming platform started out with only one title, but now boasts the largest library of
games on the blockchain. Social features, live operations, and events have only added to
the user experience. The platform also aims to give back to the community through events
such as the Binance Charity Poker Tournament. As TRONbet enters the next phase of its
platform strategy, this commitment to excellence and community will remain the
cornerstone of TRONBet’s growth.

In anticipation of TRONbet’s sustained growth, and a strategic investment from the
TRON Arcade fund, the team has decided to officially rebrand TRONbet as WINK
(Wink.org). WINk will be blockchain’s premier gaming platform for users to play, socialize,
and stake across multiple blockchain ecosystems.

The WIN token will be the centerpiece of this new platform. Through behavioural mining,
innovative token economy design, and other incentive mechanisms, developers will be
given the power to build the best DApps possible, and players will be enabled to become
platform stakeholders as the platform continues on its path of providing best
decentralized gaming experiences on the blockchain.

Why TRON?

WINk intends to leverage TRON’s ambition to establish “a truly decentralized Internet” to
become the premier blockchain gaming platform across all chains. From our perspective,
the TRON protocol has managed to meet expectations by becoming one of the largest
blockchain-based operating systems in the world. We intend to take advantage of TRON’s
high throughput and scalability to provide the best user experience possible for the
community we serve.

As blockchain technology proliferates through modern society, WINk will help bring
about mass adoption by engaging and educating the everyday consumer.

Scalability

WINk will utilize the TRON network’s 2000 TPS capacity and 3 second block times to
provide instantaneous gameplay and reliable service no matter how big the platform
grows. WINk has also developed its own scaling solutions that have been implemented in
games like slots and poker. These optimizations have pushed WINk’s gameplay to the
forefront of industry standards and the team remains committed to improving the
platform’s decentralization and usability.

Free Transactions

WINk puts the user experience first, and that means free transaction costs are a necessity.
For games that run directly on the TRON blockchain, users receive bountiful supplies of
energy and bandwidth for staking a small amount of TRX. The WINk platform will also
help cover some of these costs by putting up its own energy and bandwidth for its user
transactions.

Furthermore, WINK will be integrating its scaling solution with new games that run on the
platform to eliminate transaction costs completely. Games like slots and poker currently
run cost-free, with many more titles to be added in the future.
Please visit Wink.org for more information.

Liquidity & Adoption

The WINk team will be working closely with TRON to leverage all the opportunities
TRON’s rapidly growing ecosystem has to offer. Starting with an IEO, the WIN token will
build on top of ANTE’s existing demand and liquidity by bringing in stakeholders from
TRON, BitTorrent, and other communities across the blockchain. TRON’s strong
relationships with industry leaders, including the top exchanges, will facilitate WIN’s
widespread adoption.

Going forward, TRON will continue adding utility to the network with WINk being one of
the earliest adopters.

e User acquisition channels. With several upcoming partnerships, TRON will bring
DApps to a pool of over 300 million users. Just like with BitTorrent’s community,
each new partner community will be introduced to blockchain and cryptocurrency
through WINk’s games.

e Decentralized financial products. Integrations for stablecoins, security tokens,
microloans, and more will bring new payment possibilities, easier on-boarding, and
new forms of value generation.

e Decentralized development infrastructure. Integrations with products like the
BitTorrent File System (BTFS) and the SUN network will provide new development
possibilities, helping WIN maintain its edge on the competition.

The immediate future looks bright for WINk. With the acquisition of BitTorrent and its
100m MAU user base, TRON currently forms the largest decentralized network in the
world. BitTorrent Speed, a blockchain implementation of the BitTorrent protocol, will be
the first widely adopted blockchain use case that educates and engages users from across
the world on the potential of blockchain technology.

Introducing this pool of users to WINk gives them new opportunities to utilize
cryptocurrency and will convert them from blockchain enthusiasts to permanent
members of the community. With such synergy between WINk’s product and TRON’s
ecosystem, the limit is beyond the moon!
Please visit Wink.org for more information.

How It Works

For Developers

The WINk platform provides a set of tools so that developers can focus on creating
premium DApps while the platform takes care of the rest. For the platform’s services, the
developer will pay a small percentage n of the their DApp’s operating income. Developers
are encouraged to devise new ways to engage community members and provide
incentives through clever economy design.

For the Community

The community of DApp players will benefit as a whole as they join the platform on its
odyssey towards becoming the world’s leading blockchain gaming platform. The more a
user plays, the more tokens they will be able to mine. Users will be able to show their
loyalty to specific DApps on the platform and mine tokens bound to individual DApps.

For WIN HODLers

WIN token holders are the core of the WINk gaming platform. Every DApp hosted on the
gaming platform will share a portion of the winnings with WIN token holders through the
“WinDrop.” The WinDrop will take place everyday and incentivize ecosystem participants
with TRX. The amount of TRX distributed to each user will be proportional to the amount
of Win Power they hold. Participants receive Win Power for staking their WIN tokens.
This mechanism will aggregate more activity on the platform and continue to increase the
value of WIN.

More details about the WinDrop system will be released in the future. The team believes
this broad token distribution mechanism will help grow a vibrant community engaged
with the platform’s growth, partnerships, governance process, and more.

Token Economy

WIN Token

WIN token, a TRC20-based utility token, is WINk’s platform token. WIN holders are the
platform’s core user base and will receive numerous benefits for their loyal support of the
token. Much like the VIP guests of Vegas gaming establishments, WIN token holders will
be treated like blockchain royalty. WIN tokens will only be earned through the IEO,
secondary markets, airdrops, and promotional events. The following is a non-exhaustive
list of WIN token’s use cases.

e Staking and governance rights. WINk will actively encourage its user base to
participate as both players and community members. Users will be able to use
their WIN tokens and Win Power to participate in the governance of the WINk
platform. By incentivizing a knowledgeable and engaged community, WINk can
improve retention rates and ensure the platform grows in response to player
feedback. Read the ecosystem section for more details, and follow WINk’s
channels to stay up to date.

e Alleviating resource burn. While the WINk platform will have minimal costs by
leveraging TRON’s infrastructure, high volume players and DApps that serve a
large user bases will still benefit from holding and staking WIN. Holding WIN will
decrease the amount of resources spent on every transaction.

e Exclusive opportunities and experiences. The WINk and TRON team are
veterans within the gaming industry and understand how to build hype and create
unforgettable game experiences. The recent Binance Charity Poker Cup that was
hosted on the platform gave users a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to play
alongside celebrities like Spencer Dinwidde, CZ, Justin Sun, and more. In the
future, the WIN token will provide access to similar opportunities that can’t be
accessed on any other platform.

e Gameplay discounts. This benefit might come in the form of a direct discount,
better payouts, or an increased mining rate depending on the DApp and
development team. As more developers come onto the platform and build out
their library of game titles, WIN holders can look forward to additional benefits

10
Please visit Wink.org for more information.

that help their cryptocurrency go the extra mile.

e Stake for Win Power. WIN token holders will maximize the value of their tokens
by staking for Win Power. A user’s Win Power will be directly proportional to the
amount of WIN that is staked. Staking will occur via smart contract. While staked
WIN cannot be traded, sold, or used in any way. In order to unstake WIN, users
must submit a request and wait for a certain amount of time. Users can reclaim all
staked tokens. The benefits of accumulating Win Power will vary between games
and continue expanding as more features are addedMore details coming soon.

e Distribution of Staking Rewards. WIN will be used to redistribute rewards to
those who make the WINk platform possible. The exact staking and distribution
mechanisms will be communicated in more detail as the project gets closer to
launch. The reward will be distributed in the form of TRX, which is a percentage of
the revenue from the platform’s operations. The reward distribution will happen
automatically, with no artificial hoops for users to jump through.

DApp Tokens

WINk will be an open, non-exclusive platform that supports applications running on
different blockchains like TRON, Ethereum, EOS, Binance Chain, etc. There will be no
downside to playing a game that runs on a blockchain other than TRON. In fact, each
DApp will have its own utility token that provides extra value. DApp tokens will be
uniquely designed to the specifications of each DApp developer and cannot be traded on
any secondary market.

Although being unable to trade DApp tokens might feel unfavorable, this decision was
made to help the WIN token retain value. DApp tokens will still capture long-term value
by giving users exclusive access to WIN token airdrops. The airdrop schedule is coming
soon, and more benefits for accruing DApp tokens will be added continuously.

11
Please visit Wink.org for more information.

WIN Token Issuance

WINk will create a total issuance of 999 billion WIN tokens. Tokens will be allocated in the
following proportions.

A large portion of WIN will be distributed to the loyal ANTE holders that played
TRONbet. When a user goes through the token swap process, they will receive a certain
amount of WIN for each ANTE they freeze.

Please read this blog post for more details about the token swap process:
https://medium.com/@tronbethelp/ante-win-prepare-for-take-off-353d41b43401

Understandably, there will be concerns over the WIN token’s greater supply compared to
ANTE. Rest assured, the TRON team has come up with a plan to combat inflation.

12
Please visit Wink.org for more information.

e Limited circulating supply. When WIN is initially released, only a small portion of
the token will be in circulation. While most token holders will need to wait through
lockups, vesting periods, or both, WIN tokens swapped from ANTE will be
immediately available for staking and trading. The initial circulating supply of WIN
will only be 20.99% of the total supply. Tokens given to ANTE holders will comprise
over 57% of the initial circulating supply. Given WIN’s vesting schedule, the
ecosystem will be given time to develop before experiencing an influx of new
tokens. Users will be given ample opportunity to buy or sell WIN, and put
themselves in the best financial position possible.

e Incentives to HODL. We foresee WIN’s value appreciating as utility continues
being added. At first, utility and value will largely come from airdrops and the
WinDrop. Further on, the introduction of governance, ecosystem fund, and 3rd
party developers will carry the WIN token’s value accrual.

e Prestigious partners, advisors, and investors. The WINk rebrand will be an
opportunity for new stakeholders to come into ecosystem. These stakeholders will
give WINk new opportunities for partnerships, user acquisition, technological
integrations, and more. Users will feel the positive impact immediately with
Binance facilitating the WINk IEO and TRON investing in the platform’s long-term
future. More partnerships are coming soon!

e Massive user acquisition. The Binance IEO, TRON investment, and other aspects
of the WINk rebrand will give the platform the resources necessary to improve
onboarding and usability to maximize conversions from marketing campaigns to
hundreds of millions of users. More users will increase the daily rewards pool and
ultimately help the WIN token succeed.

e Expanding game library. WINk will introduce new developer tools, easier
on-boarding, and support for games on all public chains. Furthermore, partnerships
that bring in AAA-quality games will add diversity to WIN’s offerings. We project
that more games will lead to greater player engagement, which benefits all
stakeholders on the platform.

Given these considerations, it is unlikely that ANTE holders will lose value when swapping
their tokens either in the short-term or the long-term. As the WINk platform grows, we
hope the original ANTE holders will continue to hod! WIN and become active
stakeholders in the ecosystem’s new games and partnerships.

13
Please visit Wink.org for more information.

Public Sale - 5%

The IEO will take place on August 8th, 2019 Token purchased through this initial sale will
have no lockup and will be immediately available for trading.

Airdrop - 5%

Sometime in August 2019, WINk will initiate its first airdrop of WIN token to TRX holders.
This airdrop will distribute 10,989,000,000 WIN, which will be 22% of the total airdrop
allocation. Make sure to follow WINk’s announcements to be a part of this momentous
occasion.

During the 12 months following the initial airdrop, WINk will distribute 11,880,000,000
WIN (24% of the airdrop allocation) to TRX holders. The same amount of WIN will be
distributed every month, but the number of airdrops and how they are structured may
vary. For example, some months might feature a single airdrop to all types of token
HODLers and others might feature several airdrops exclusive to holders of certain DApp
tokens.

WIN token airdrops will last for over 3 years, with the amount being distributed to
increase year over year.

Our airdrops will have no hoops for users to jump through - if you are holding the specified
token, you will be eligible for WIN airdrops. All official wallets relaying on TRON’s
network and carrying the specified tokens will be eligible for WIN airdrops corresponding
to the amount they are holding. Exchanges that support the WIN token airdrop will be
announced through our social channels. No minimum amount of tokens will be required to
qualify for WIN airdrops. Please stay tuned to receive more information on these
opportunities.

WIN will be airdropped according to this schedule:

Platform Development - 7%

Every month, a portion of WIN tokens will be allocated for the growth of the WINk
platform. These tokens will be used for hiring additional developers, infrastructure costs,
exploring new technologies, and more. In order to ensure accountability, the WINk team
will provide the community an annual report of how the development funds were spent
and what results were achieved.

Gaming Partnership - 9%

WINk will be working with high-profile game developers, publishers, and I|P-holders to
bring their properties to the WINk platform. By bringing on popular games with iconic
characters and brands, WINk will acquire the mainstream appeal necessary to bring
blockchain gaming to the average consumer.

Team - 10%

WINk’s team is committed to the platform’s long-term growth and success. All of the core
team members have committed to developing for the platform throughout the
foreseeable future and have performance-based incentives tied into their agreements.

WINk will use funds to implement frequent ecosystem upgrades to improve the platform
and its users’ gaming experience. Examples of this include on-chain governance, a DApp
store, ecosystem fund, new social features, payment rails, and much more. WINk will
provide an annual report of how the WIN tokens allocated towards the ecosystem are
used.

Check out the “Ecosystem” section below for details on how WINk will develop.

investment are the first steps towards making this dream happen, and there is only more
to come.

Ecosystem

Effective on-chain governance requires new technology such as DAOs, cryptographic
voting systems, and collaboration interfaces to be built, maintained, and updated. The
WINk platform will take on this responsibility, and provide highly effective tools for DApp
developers to utilize within the WINk gaming ecosystem.

As aresult, developers will be able to focus on creating premium DApp experiences, while
allowing WINk to take care of the platform, system, ecosystem development, and
maintenance. If all goes well, the community will be the greatest benefactors from this
system. Users will be able to select from blockchain’s most premium gaming experiences
straight from their web browser, and rest assured that their cryptocurrency is safe in an
ecosystem built by an experienced engineering team and rigorously tested to be safe and
secure.

WINk will build this ecosystem through a process of constant self-assessment and
development. Additionally, on-chain governance will be used to target and fund
improvements. The community will have a strong say on which projects they want to see
completed before updates are then launched on the network. The WINk gaming
ecosystem will also include the following support.

Developer Portal

Developers that join the ecosystem will be able to access the latest SDK, APIs, and
technology documents needed to connect to the ecosystem.

The portal would also include a set of tools for developers to utilize the blockchain,
reward pools and mining systems, social features, identity management systems, wallets
and more. This set of tools will allow both experienced and inexperienced developers alike
to streamline their development process and bring users the best gaming experience
possible.

DApp Store & Content Discovery

After developing their DApps, developers can submit it to the DApp Store for easy
distribution. If approved, DApps will be listed on the DApp Store in several different

18
Please visit Wink.org for more information.

locations based on DApp category and popularity. The platform’s editorial team will also
review and recommend certain DApps from time to time, highlighting these DApps in
premium spaces.

WINk is also working on building out a content discovery mechanism, where users can
receive recommendations on new games as well as incentives to try them out. We want to
give newcomers to the blockchain development scene the chance to make it big, so fresh
talent has a reason to stick around.

Developers also have the option to pay for promotional advertisements on the DApp
Store to drive more traffic to their games. Pricing will be based on a combination of cost
per mil or cost per location/time. The revenue from these ads will be shown transparently
and aggregated to the platform revenue. A portion of these rewards will later be given to
users based on their Win Power.

As any game developer would tell you, it’s all about getting users to your platform and
then working hard to retain a healthy community. As such, user acquisition and retention
has been a major roadblock for most blockchain gaming projects since development teams
have started to explore the space. Many projects across Ethereum, EOS, and TRON have
failed due to the costs associated with finding a user base. With many DApps centering
around token economies and needing users to drive demand and liquidity, solving the user
question has become of utmost importance.

The TRONbet project was lucky to have first-mover advantage on TRON and then
leverage their experience in the games industry to maintain growth. The WINk team
doesn’t want low visibility and expensive UA to prevent more developers from entering
the space. Therefore, the team will design the WINk DApp store as an opportunity for all
projects in the space to acquire users more efficiently.

Community

The community will be based off the existing TRONbet community which currently has
over 16,000 engaged players.

We understand the importance of social components in gaming, so there are quite a few
major updates in the works. Over the next year, the development team will roll out a
revamped account creation system, a new chat system, friends lists, gift exchange, and
more. Our goal is to foster a sense of community where users can come together to share
ideas about gaming, crypto, or whatever else they want to discuss.

19
Please visit Wink.org for more information.

Developers will have direct access to engage with these social channels to provide
services, support, and even community engagement events such as promotional
campaigns, gifts or giveaways.

Payment Services

Developers can integrate WINk’s platform payment services into their DApps. The goal of
this functionality is to make any payment as easy as possible, comparable to the simplicity
of making an in-app purchase on iOS and Android app stores. Users can make payments
using cryptocurrencies in their wallet, or from their credit card, debit card, or bank
account. Users will be able to easily withdraw their cryptocurrencies to fiat whenever
they want.

Wallet

The team will be working closely with the TRONLink team to provide premium wallet
services that will be optimized and expanded for the WINk platform’s audience. In the
future, WINk will expand access to the platform so anyone can play no matter the type of
cryptocurrency they hold.

Regulatory Compliance

WINk will fully comply with gaming regulations for different jurisdictions. The team has
already started the compliance process and is in the process of obtaining relevant licenses
in Curacao and Costa Rica. The team is also planning to work with regulatory agencies
around the world to get all the necessary documents and licenses.

WINk has made great efforts to ensure compliance of our interactive gaming platform.
Both the Curacao and Costa Rica licenses are expected to be obtained before the project’s
official launch. As a fully licensed and legal interactive gaming platform, WINk will
eliminate the possibility of being shut down by authorities and continue to growina
sustainable manner.

Why did we choose Curacao? Curacao Gaming is one of the oldest online gaming
regulators in the world and we will receive a master gaming license issued by their
Ministry of Justice. A Curacao license has no restrictions on the territories which its
licensees intend to do business with. Here are additional details for the license.

20
Please visit Wink.org for more information.

Official Decree of the Central Government of Curacao (formerly the Netherlands
Antilles) No. 365/JAZ dated August 18, 1998 No. 14 signed by the Minister of
Justice laying down the Master License granted to Gaming Services Provider
allowing the operation of Games of Chance on the International market via service
lines. Business scope includes Curacao and also in countries where there is no
requirement to a local license.

Why did we choose Costa Rica? A Costa Rica gaming license allows us to get players from
many countries besides Costa Rica. This means our games are open to users from all
legally gambling countries. Furthermore, WINk is able to run most kinds of gambling
under the Costa Rica license. This means we can also launch sports games, quiz games,
lotteries, and much more.

To reiterate, both Curacao and Costa Rica licenses are in the process of being acquired
and it is expected that both will be obtained before WINk’s official launch.

21
Please visit Wink.org for more information.

Tournaments

The platform will be hosting several tournaments to engage the WINk community and
TRON fans in general. Recently, the team hosted the very first Charity Poker Cup
together with Binance, TRON and Litecoin. This event brought together Binance
Co-founder & CEO CZ, TRON Founder Justin Sun, Litecoin Founder Charlie Lee, and
other leaders from industries including professional basketball, eSports, and
entertainment.

Team

Together, the team behind WINk has decades of experience in gaming, blockchain, and
numerous other industries. We are united by our passion for blockchain technology and
how it could revolutionize the gaming industry.

Like many others, Bitcoin’s meteoric rise in 2017 caught our attention, and learning of the
technology’s potential fully captured our imaginations. Our core team members left their
previous projects, started researching blockchain, and explored the possibilities of getting
involved. TRONbet started out as a small side-project composed of the 3 founders, but
quickly grew to a team of 11 full-time members. With an investment from the TRON
Arcade Fund and the upcoming rebrand, we’re looking forward to what the future holds.

With members coming from teams all around the world, WINk is a truly global project. 3
of the 11 team members come from gaming and product management backgrounds,
whereas the other four are blockchain veterans, participating in the industry as
developers in addition to operations and business development managers. Several team
members on the gaming side also had a hand in developing and delivering top mobile
gaming content, and we're excited to announce that these same people designed the game
mechanics and development of WINk.

The WINk team is incredibly grateful for the opportunity to create this product for the

millions of blockchain enthusiasts around the globe. We are confident that we’re the best
team for the job, and will continue to add top talent to ensure the platform’s success.

Games

Dice

Roll Under Roll Over

All Bets s Rare Wins

Dice was the flagship game when the platform first launched in late 2018. Despite the
game’s simple mechanics, it has remained a crowd favorite for its polished and fast-paced
gameplay.

Dice uses a random number generator to roll a value from 0 to 99. The object of the game
is to have the dice roll fall within the range of numbers you choose. The smaller the range,
the greater the risk and reward! Users can easily check their win chance via Dice’s user
interface.

In order to play, users first select the amount of TRX, ANTE, or BTT they wish to wager.
Users then choose whether they want to predict Under or Over, and select a number. If
the user selects Under, all values under the number selected will be winners. If the user
selects Over, all values over the number selected will be winners.

If the dice roll falls within the user’s winning range, they will receive a payout proportional
to their chances of winning.

Moon

Moon is a game that mimics the exhilarating highs of the cryptocurrency market. Players
are paid based on a multiplier that starts from 1x and can reach highs of over 250x. The
multiplier increases steadily, but can crash to zero at any point. Players can cash out at any
point in time and receive the multiplier value.

Cashing out your winnings is as easy as clicking a button, or you can risk it all to go for the
moon!

Poker

By adding the benefits of cryptocurrency to a polished online poker product, the team has
hit on something big. TRX allows users to deposit and withdraw instantly, unlike
traditional online poker platforms that might even withhold funds. Low to no rake helps
players win bigger and more consistently, and the vibrant community ensures that action
will always be found. Poker will continue adding exciting features, like tournaments and
rake back, to its already solid foundation. As the platform grows to become the premier
blockchain gaming hub, the game will bring decentralization, transparency, and
accessibility to the online poker community.

Created by MixMarvel, the acclaimed studio behind HyperDragons,
HyperSnakes introduces new abilities and battle royale mode to classic Slither.io
gameplay.

Players can compete with each other for free (and earn cryptocurrency just for
participating), or stake their own TRX (TRON’s native coin) to compete for massive prize
pools.

HyperSnake’s core gameplay is similar to its predecessor. Control your snake avatar,
collect dots to grow longer, and defeat other players to become the longest snake in the
arena. The mechanics are easy to pick up, but only the most skilled players will walk away
alive.

MixMarvel & TRON are trailblazing the next generation of gaming where players will

finally be rewarded for their contributions to the gaming ecosystem. Look forward to
participating in the revolution on TRONbet.

Blocklords

BLOCKLORDS is a blockchain strategy game where players vie for control of cities and
kingdoms that provide immense economic power. Level up and equip your hero with the
best items to give your army an edge on the battlefield.

The trading of assets is a core aspect of blockchain games and will of course be included in
BLOCKLORDS. Since each item has a unique look, quality, and attribute, value will differ
based on player demand. Early generation assets can be burned to create more powerful
items in later gens, meaning early players will have a distinct advantage.

City lords will earn taxes on all trades made within their cities, as well as dividends from

the city coffers, creating a strong incentive for players to conquer as much territory as
possible!

Team Goo

Goo was created by MrBlobby to bring life to the genre of idle games on the blockchain.
EtherGoo was the first iteration and was launched mid 2018. Following the dapp's success
it was later evolved, re-balanced and ported across to the fast Tron network to give
players a more real-time idle game experience. TronGoo was launched early 2019 and
remains one of Tron's most transacted game.

Goo's core gameplay involves players amassing a wide range of units and items for further
Goo production and PvP battles, in order to earn TRX based on their production!

The Goo team are now aiming to innovate once again on the Tron Network, with several
projects planned for 2019. Their first is a deflationary token called Frags, which will be
getting a version of Goo later. They are also looking to harness Tron's network to build a
powerful Trading Card Game, as well as onchain lootcrates. The Goo team is looking
forward to guide the Tron future of dapps.

The APIS is building a “Masternode Mediation Platform”
to familiarize the term “masternode” to a larger range of
people and let them enjoy the advantages and benefits of
a masternode. This paper is intended to give an overview
of our approach in attaining this goal from explaining the
concept of a masternode to elucidating how we will make

this unfamiliar concept known to wider variety of people.

1. Introduction and Problem Statement

The APIS is a masternode mediation platform that
enables the entire spectrum of users to have easy access
to the two-tier incentivized network, also known as the
“Masternode Network”. Masternodes refer to nodes in
the cryptocurrency market that fulfill a specific function
beyond simply relaying transactions (Its definition will
be further developed in the paragraphs to follow). A
masternode’s most distinctive feature is that any investor

investing in a masternode can acquire stable and almost

guaranteed profit just by locking up his/her money in
the masternode for a fixed amount of time. However,
despite its attractive characteristic, hosting a masternode
is quite out of reach for most individual investors since
most masternodes require substantial capital and intricate
software engineering to set up.

By aiding these average individuals come together to
form a whole masternode, we will be able to encourage
more people to participate in masternode investments
as well as provide them with a much safer investment
channel rather than investing in the exchange market

without adequate knowledge.

2. What is a Masternode?
2.1. Definition
Masternodes are “servers” in the cryptocurrencies

network that relay transactions and sometimes also process

other specific functions. The most distinctive characteristic
of a masternode is that the users can deposit their money
in a “masternode product” and earn a portion of the block
rewards in the form of the cryptocurrency they invested
in. The yield varies primarily according to the masternode
count and each coin might have different payout periods.
This makes masternode a means to generate “passive
income” from cryptocurrencies without having to run
expensive mining equipment or having to actively invest
in exchanges. To create a masternode, a user only needs
to lock in a specific amount of coin. Users can then either
set up a server to host the masternode or ask a service

provider to do so on their behalf.

2.2. Proof-of-Work(POW) and Proof-of-Stake(POS)
Coin mining can be divided into two different methods:
POW (Proof-of-Work) and POS (Proof-of-Stake). POW is a
system in which the higher the hash reserve is, the more
blocks one can find for more coins. There is also the
concept of “difficulty” in order to keep the block-generation
time constant. The difficulty increases as the total hash

increases and more hashes are required for finding

more blocks along with the increased difficulty, which
consequently leads the block generation time to remain

constant. However, this POW method has some limitations.

On the economic side, there are cost problems such as
high electricity consumption, high costs of expensive
mining equipment (ASIC, GPU, etc) and their maintenance,
as well as security and centralization issues regarding hash
monopolization. For most coins, the POW method had
been chosen in the past and the most typical examples are
Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum.
POS is a method designed to solve the biggest
drawbacks of POW, namely security issues caused by

hash monopolization and high cost for the purchase of

equipment and their maintenance. For POS, the higher the
stake proportion for the entire coin supply, the higher the
acquisition amount for the additional coins issued. In other
words, the role of “hash” in the POW method is equivalent
to the role of “stake” in the POS method. More simply,
it can be conceived as being similar to bank interest. In

addition, the POS method can also achieve strong security

just by linking multiple wallets that keep coins inside. In

recent years, coins based on the POS method have been

increasing and existing coins are also changing from

the POW method to POS method. Ethereum is a perfect

example of this.

2.3. Masternode using POS method

Masternodes include mining through the POS method. In
the case of mining, block generation time varies according
to mining difficulty, and the mining output also changes
according to the number of masternodes formed in the
blockchain. In general, masternode coins are hybrid in the
sense that they consist of both POW and POS methods.
They will follow the POW method up to a specific block and

‘o the POS method after that.

A masternode guarantees stable Return On Investment
(ROI), the profit gained from an investment. High ROI
signifies that the investment was successful and cost-
efficient. In other words, ROI is a financial term used to
measure the efficiency of investments and investment
methods.

For example, 1,000 DASH coins, a typical masternode coin,
purchased as exchange a year ago at USD 8.82 (December
1, 2016) would have generated an ROI this year of about
9040% as DASH prices soared from USD 8.82 to USD 806.18
as of December 1, 2017, but the number of DASH coins

possessed would still remain the same at 1,000.
However, the calculation would be significantly different
if one bought 1,000 DASH coins a year ago and formed

a masternode instead of buying them as exchange. The

number of coins one would have this year would have risen
to 1,088 and the RO! would have risen to 9844%; needless
to say that if the coin price increases continuously, the ROI
would be even greater. What is more interesting is that even
if the coin price declined, one would still be able to manage
one’s risks since the investor could still earn additional
coins generated from the masternode regardless of price

fluctuation.

However, the problem that most people face when forming a masternode is that in order to form a masternode, there is

a minimum number of coins that inves'

‘ors need to possess, which often exceeds

For example, the minimum amount required to form a DASH masternode is 1,000

the capacity of most ordinary investors.

DASH coins (equivalent to USD 760,000).

Another example is STRATIS coin, which requires 25,000 coins (equivalent to USD 1,700,000) to form a masternode.

System build-up and maintenance that require professional knowledge is another problem that deters most small

investors. For example, a well-known masternode coin, DASH, requires both 1,000 DASH coins to form a single masternode

and 24 hours of non-stop servers and related programs for stable operation.

Bitcoin volatility means “more regulation” of cryptocurrency is on the way. As can be inferred from the graph above,
Bitcoin's price volatility outstrips all other assets. High volatility implies high risk and this is the main reason why many
people regard investment in cryptocurrency as “speculation”, thus bringing about various regulation. This misconception
has become an obstacle to the development of cryptocurrency, in a further sense, blockchain.

However, with the introduction of masternode investments, ordinary investors can now minimize their risk taking and
still generate sizable earnings. Moreover, now that many investors are seeking to find a reliable place to invest their money,

it is high time that we start focusing more on masternode platforms rather than existing exchange markets.

3. The APIS Masternode Mediation Platform
3.1. Business Model

Cryptocurrency, which has emerged with the development of blockchain that opened up with the Fourth Industrial
Revolution, is characterized by decentralization, anonymity, and reliability and is now attracting new investors from various
fields. Nevertheless, large price fluctuation is making cryptocurrency investment seem “speculative” and is raising fears of
becoming a social problem.

The APIS Masternode Mediation Platform will provide both investors with a steady income with minimized risk and the
market with reliability, accessibility and price stability. Ultimately, APIS aims to become the first key currency of masternode

coins and will ensure complete anonymity.

3.2. Platform Overview

The APIS Platform (also called “The APIS Core”) is a Ethereum public-chain based masternode mediation platform that
aims to help individual and corporate investors invest in desired masternodes easily and effectively. It supports both PC
(personal computer) and mobile devices, thereby providing users with the chance to make stable profit and enjoy more
cryptocurrency’s benefits conveniently. This section explains the importance of the APIS Core along with the usefulness
and innovativeness of its official coin “APIS (Advanced Property Investment System)”, named after the ancient Egyptian
bull deity.

In the case of existing masternode coins such as DASH, MEME and others, not only maintaining a certain amount of
coins on the software wallet but also implementing them on a Linux server that can be operated 24 hours stably is also
very crucial. However, these conditions are problematic for most people as they are not familiar with IT and resolving
maintenance problems inherent in hardware management, software update and security assurance. One purpose of our
platform is to deal with such inconveniences and let non-professional investors who wish to form a masternode take part
just by becoming a member of the APIS Platform without having to consider any of the annoying complications such as

hardware or software manipulation.

3.3. Platform Configuration
3.3.1. Masternode Core

A masternode core is a distributed database consisting of cutting-edge encryption technology to manage APIS
Masternode user reports, shares and trading records on the platform. Individual participants’ wallet information is securely
stored in the form of a Ethereum-based blockchain that also ensures system stability and asset protection through
systemic data backup and restoration. Masternode information that is already incorporated on the platform will be
accessible in the future through API and SDK that will be provided and all data communication will be encrypted as well.

Through this process, we can strengthen the scalability of the APIS mediation platform.
3.3.2. Masternode Hub

Masternode Hub composes and manages various coins such as DASH, MEME and BTDX's masternodes systematically.
When a masternode is newly formed from investor participation, the masternode hub automatically creates VPS
(Virtual Private Server) for each masternode, prepares required up-to-date software and operates the masternode by
depositing designated amount of cryptocurrency in the wallet through the masternode core. All processes are carried out
automatically and the investors are informed with a push-message every time there is progress in the procedure such as

the building of VPS, installation of software and creation of wallet.

Masternode Hub constantly reports rewards obtained from the running of each masternode to the masternode core

and allows investors to clearly track their interests through the APIS Core. Masternode Hub's hardware operates 24 hours

by our highly-experienced management team.

3.3.3. APIS Core

APIS Core manages user information as well as APIS assets and provides all core functions that correlate with the
masternode core. APIS Core is an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)-based blockchain program that can be connected with
various platforms such as Ethereum or Qtum and it makes use of POS methods. APIS Core supports multiple Operating
Systems (OS) such as Windows, Linux, Mac, Android and iOS.

3.4. Platform Accessibility and Security

Distributed Network of APIS

Distributed Denial of Service(DDoS) attacks aimed at cryptocurrency are increasing these days. Cryptocurrency network
at its incipient stage is very vulnerable to attacks owing to its small number of nodes. Moreover, if nodes consisting a
network are regionally concentrated or disproportionately dispersed, there is a high chance that the transaction signals
might decrease in their efficiency.

In order to prevent this from happening, we will distribute our networks and evenly provide signals to different places.
For this purpose, APIS will build its system servers all around the world distributed and these servers will be located in

main IDCs worldwide, operating multiple servers.

When users transfer other cryptocurrency(such as Bitcoin or Ethereum) to the APIS Core, they receive APIS coins of the
same value converted, which means all investments on this platform are carried out in APIS coinage and are ready for
investment in desired masternodes through a function in the APIS Core.

Once the investment terminates, investors can receive their rewards according to their share/contribution. 5% of the
company’s interest generated from the APIS masternode mediation platform will be donated to related foundations of

blockchain programming and development to improve current poor development condition.

The APIS core is a proprietary program that supports investment in masternodes of various cryptocurrencies, investment
in the APIS masternode, APIS coin charges, APIS coin deposit and APIS coin withdrawal.

The role of the "masternode selection" function is to let users identify the conditions of a certain masternode such as
ROI, technology and price needed to form its masternode. Once the user selects a masternode to invest from the list in the

APIS Core, the user can send any amount of his/her APIS coins to the desired masternode.

Example) Kevin wants to form a DASH masternode to make stable income, but he can only afford 100 DASH coins whereas

the minimum number of DASH coins needed to form a DASH masternode is 1,000. Kevin is aware that he can use the APIS
Core to form a DASH masternode with only 100 DASH coins. Once the designated time for investment ends, Kevin will

receive 1/10 of the total reward gained, which includes both principal and the total reward gained.

step further as users can freely exchange their APIS coins with

hen getting the interest back. This function is particularly useful

for individuals or corporations that do not want to leave any trace of their transactions behind. The APIS Protocol is the

one that processes all these in the APIS Core. Users can send their currencies confidentially and anonymously through

the “APIS Private Send” function. This ensures that all mas

ernodes on the network provide this anonymization service, so

there is no centralized party to attack or interrupt the transaction.

2) Atomic Swap and Lightning Network

A technology scheduled to be applied in Q4 2018, Atomic Swap refers to the direct transaction between two different

coins operated on separate blockchains. The distinguishing trait of this technology is that there is no third-person or party

involved in the middle. Once applied, it will make it greatly easier for investors to buy cryptocurrencies, as no further

complicated maneuvering of any kind is required. Once commercialized, users will be able to buy coins directly from their

wallets without having to go through separate platforms.

In the APIS platform, we are planning to apply this technology

in masternode formation in the sense that users’ APIS will be automatically converted to specific coins that they want to

invest in through Atomic Swap.

14
3) Lightning Network

Just like Atomic Swap, Lightning Network is also a
technology that makes use of "hash time lock contract”.
The only difference between the two is that when Atomic
Swap connects blockchains, Lightning Network connects
each payment channel.

If A and B have a payment channel and B and C have a
payment channel, A and C can trade through B even if A
does not trust C personally. For example, Rachel, who only

has 1 Litecoin intends to buy Jack's car that Jack labeled

"

fay

Bitcoin" as the price. Rachel and Robert already have

a Litecoin channel open, and Jack already has a Bitcoin

channel open with Robert. Rachel sends 200 Litecoins

to Robert and Robert sends 1 Bitcoin to Jack. All these

transactions are carried out by hash time lock contracts

and Robert functions as the payment conduit that does

not require trust between Rachel and Robert in these

transactions.

Rachel and Jack had both their Litecoin and Bitcoin

channels open with Robert, they would have been able

‘0 exchange their coins via this platform called "Robert".
f Rachel sends 200 Litecoins to Robert, then Robert
ransmits these directly to Jack. Similarly, the 1 Bitcoin that
Jack sends to Robert will be forwarded directly to Rachel.
hash

These transactions are also made possible throug
ime lock contracts and Robert in this case, functions as an
altcoin exchanger that does not require any degree or form

of trust between the two entities involved. Robert's role in

his case, is what our masternode mediation platform, the

APIS Core, would undertake.

However, in order for the successful launch of lightning
network, we first have to deal with service DoS problems.
Even though Lightning Network itself is already devised to

deter malicious individuals from stealing coins, someone

in the middle (Robert in the case above) can postpone or

block the transaction. Such concerns can be resolved

by closing out channels with uncooperative participants.
By doing so, uncooperative participants that still want
channels open can be ruled out, taking part in service DoS

attacks.

However, in order to ensure that all the uncooperative
channels are closed and attackers ruled out, each
participant in the payment chain should be able to
monitor all the participants. There is also the problem
of six individuals having to keep track of transactions
with Litecoin, even if only 2 people in the chain use a

Litecoin channel, in order to prevent possible blockage

of the channel. This problem, however, can also be easily

resolved if our platform performs the role of middleman.

3.5.5.3. Benefits for APIS Users

We are aiming for a differentiated operating policy from existing masternode coins. In the case of APIS, we adopt a

hierarchical operation system by differentiating rewarding rates according to the amount of investment made in the

APIS masternode. Moreover, by applying Parallel Masternodes Technology, POS Algorithm, we will realize 1 PC - Multi

Masternodes, but not 1 PC - 1 Masternode.

3.5.5.4. APIS Vision and Platform Scalability
The ultimate goal of APIS is to “lower the entry barrier of
cryptocurrency for everybody to join”. In order to make this

possible, we will start by achieving the followings:

1) Smart Contract on Canvas
As bitcoin’s simple script is evolving into smart
contract with Ethereum, the use of cryptocurrency is also
expanding into various areas including ICO funding, token
issuance, identity verification, and cloud storage service.
However, most “smart contracts” are not so
smart; they are heavily developer focused and

often neglect much needed user interface for

16

everyday users. As a result, deployed smart
contracts are hardly user friendly, if usable at all.

Smart contract end-users are also forced to utilize
the user interface provided by the core program of the
respective cryptocurrency or web-based application,
so a smart contract may have more than one correct
use case, which could further confuse its already
perplexed users. As a result, users often have to refer
to technical manual for the smart contract they are
using or get help from experienced individuals. This is
counterintuitive to the whole concept of smart contract,

which is to make cryptocurrency accessible to many users.
APIS p

ans to solve this problem by
implementing so-called “smart contract on canvas.”

Smart Contract made smarter Developers can register
UI elements(the canvas)written in HTML when they
deploy their coded smart contract on the blockchain.
Canvas consists of a single HTML file and can include
CSS, javascript, and image. Javascript code included in
the contract can be obfuscated, but it is recommended
that obfuscation is not conducted in order to provide
transparent data processing mechanism to the contract

users. Image files can be registered to the document

through Base64 encoding. SmartContracts element

implemented in javascript can be called within a canvas.
The HTML file that functions as canvas cannot be
saved on the blockchain, so developers must provide an

environment in which canvas files can be accessed through

web addresses. Theses addresses could be allocated
through creation of CanvasLocation variable within the

smart contract. In addition, the entire canvas code must

be hashed with Keccak-256 and saved on the CanvasHash
variable in its respective smart contract to prevent
secretive, unannounced changes. Through these measures,

applications can decide on the existence of a canvas,

organized a GUI, and verify immutability of the canvas used.

2) Address Masking

The use of Public and Private Key in cryptocurrency
is innovative in the security perspective, but the actual
written addresses such as hexadecimal address is
near impossible to use without copy and pasting, not
to mention memorizing. It’s not an overstatement to
say that user convenience was not among the highest
priorities when cryptocurrency addresses were developed.

For blockchain technology to go mainstream, however,
complex address such as the ones used now must also be
simplified like phone numbers or email addresses in order

to be used by the masses. APIS aims to bring “address

masking” concept to the reality for this particular reason.

Through the APIS core program, anyone can register
a simplified address that gets rerouted to their original
hexadecimal address. The simplified address consists
of a name identifier, @, and a domain name. Such
easily identifiable, simplified address can increase
user recognition of each address and resolve issues
arising from sending and receiving complex address.

To prevent uncontrolled creation of address and
their abuse by random individuals, public use
addresses and authorization-requiring addresses
are distinguished. Open domain addresses that
may be owned by any individual are limited to the
following, but can be added through user requests:

Me(personal wallet), edu(educational facility),

com(company), org(organization and group)

The owner of a domain has the authority to mask
the given address and can transfer that authority to
another person through ownership validation. Owner
of a masked address can also change the original
wallet address linked to that masked address through
ownership validation in the form of a wallet private key.
In case of a dispute regarding a masked address
or a domain, their ownership may be changed or
even terminated in accordance with the decisions
made by the country-level settling authority.

In order to deter uncontrolled address creation, there will

be a certain fee associated with masking an address.

3) Mineral System

Most cryptocurrencies present in the market today has a
small fee for using the resources required for transfer of the
currency or smart contract initiation. This fee is provided
to the node creating a new block as block reward, thereby
giving incentive to people running nodes to continue running

them. However, most cryptocurrency users are seldom

17
involved with block rewards, so the fee typically comes off as
a burden of cryptocurrency use, not advantage. Although the
‘ee is small, each and every transaction necessitates a fee. This
is rather cumbersome and inefficient, particularly in countries
where domestic bank wire to the same bank does not require a
‘ee. Cryptocurrency use fees may therefore be a major barrier to
entry for people who wish to use the currency in a daily basis.
APIS aims to improve this fee system by introducing the

ineral system. To use smart contract on APIS or transfer APIS

‘o another wallet, a separate currency called Mineral must be
used. APIS users may purchase Mineral through APIS whenever
required, and the APIS tokens spent on such transactions will be
distributed as block rewards. Mineral could also be obtained as

interest to APIS tokens placed in a personal wallet. Mineral will

be distributed proportional to the amount of APIS tokens held
in the wallet. The upper limit of Minerals receivable as interest
can also be adjusted depending on the level of contributions
a wallet has made to APIS network(such as APIS transactions),

so the most active APIS user can receive the most Minerals.

Of note, Minerals can only be used as transaction fees,
they cannot be sent to another wallet or user and cannot
be exchanged into APIS. Mineral still provides almost no-fee
environment to active APIS users, so a significant increase in
user transactions is expected as users attempt to minimize
their fees. Mineral system will therefore help real-world use of

APIS ecosystem.means a greater “fee” for them. To improve this

disincentive, APIS will do the following.
1) Mineral will automatically accumulate according to the
amount of APIS stored in the wallet.
2) Mineral can be purchased with APIS, but Mineral cannot
be converted to APIS.
3) Mineral cannot be sent to other addresses, but can only be
created and burned.
By creating this new Mineral system, we intend to contribute
to the popularization of the cryptocurrency market by enabling
faithful users of APIS to carry out several transactions without

any fee.

Legal issues of tokens crowd sale:

1. As a digital asset, most tokens are directly sold by the
team. The sale of the APIS at the pre-ICO stage will be
conducted in private, and will allow qualified investors in
the United States and China to participate. It will not be
administered by the Securities Act and does not violate
relevant requirements of China's regulators. The remaining
tokens will inhibit American and Chinese citizens to

participate.

2. Regulations: after a wide range of legal verification and
continuous focus on the development and legal structure
of digital currency, the team believes that caution regarding

the sale of tokens is advisable. Therefore, with the advent

22

of crowd-sales, we will constantly adjust the sale strategy
of tokens, and avoid relevant legal risks to the largest

extent;

3. American investors: in accordance with law, we will
screen investors based on a series of conditions (e.g.,
American citizens having over $200,000 in annual income
or whose spouse has over $300,000 annual income can
participate in crowd-selling) to guarantee that American
citizens participating in the crowd-sale are "Accredited
investors." Those not screened cannot participate in the

project’s crowd-sale;

4. Non-American investors: in terms of technology,
applying the same standard to non-American investors is
unnecessary. However, as American legal requirements
are stricter, the legal team requests us to apply the legal
restrictions that accord with American laws to non-

American investors.

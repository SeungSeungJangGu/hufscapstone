Introduction

Our vision

for the future
of digital currency

LEOcoin was created in June 2014, and
has been backed by a dedicated digital
currency exchange (www.LEOxChange.
com) since April 2015. Itis the first
digital currency to be launched in

the UK that is designed for small
business owners; allowing individuals
to make fast, secure and cost effective
transactions through a decentralised
peer-to-peer network. The usability and
accessibility of the currency positions
LEOcoin as a world currency and the
currency of choice for entrepreneurs.

LEOcoin has now undergone a
significant technological innovation,
which will give its users access to

a unique level of privacy - setting
LEOcoin apart from other digital
currency competitors.

This Whitepaper sets out the new
functionality of LEOcoin and the
key debates on the capability of
digital currencies to be anonymous
and private.

Foreword

The Western world has undoubtedly
embraced digital exchanges of
currency, but the question now is
whether it will entirely embrace digital
currency itself.

Our digital currency combines
development skills, international
infrastructure, real-world
entrepreneurial know-how, and a global
network and user base, creating a
platform for growth.

Sending LEOcoin is a fast and simple
way to transfer money globally,
without the need for transaction fees,
middlemen or banks. Through the
use of advanced cryptography and
encryption methods, LEOcoin has
managed to create a truly private
digital currency.

When the idea of cryptocurrencies
emerged, one of its purposes

was to create a truly anonymous
system that requires no bank or
centralised operator.

LEOcoin leaves banks out of the money
transfer process. This means there are
no third party transferring agents who
want their share. So the cost of sending
LEOcoin is practically zero compared
to the bank transfers most people

are used to.

This is an efficient way to send money
to family and friends as well as pay for
products and services worldwide; and

is much simpler to use than online
banking, as the user is entirely in control
of their wallet.

Sending LEOcoin is as easy as typing in
the address of the receiver and clicking
the send button. Everything else is
done by a very advanced programme
that requires no further user interaction.

Here we set out to answer a number
of questions around the security

and secureness of digital currencies
(also known as cryptocurrencies) and
blockchain technology, as well as an
introduction to LEOcoin’s new unique
privacy function.

Digital currency anonymity and privacy

Digital currencies are often referred to
as private or anonymous currencies. In
the context of financial transactions,
digital currency has the potential to
be private and anonymous with new
technological solutions now available
on the market to protect the users’
right to privacy — in this regard digital
currencies are no different to the use
of cash.

Digital currencies, like LEOcoin, are
anonymous in terms of programming,
and provide anonymity in practice
thanks in large part to advancements
in the capability to protect the users’
details — name, home address or bank
details — from all kind of snooping.
LEOcoin’s new privacy option within
the latest ‘Upgrade’ feature augments
this further.

Identities are not recorded in the
LEOcoin protocol itself, but every
transaction performed with LEOcoin

is visible on the distributed electronic
public ledger known as the blockchain.
However, outward transactions do
contain a privacy feature that protect
user's privacy and their identity from
unwanted surveillance.

The privacy provided by digital
currencies is a point of attraction and a
challenge for financial regulation (see

Jason Weinstein’s comments on page 4).

Yet the practical reality for the vast
majority of digital currency users is that

they are not operating anonymously.
For many users of digital currencies,
who access the currency through

one of the popular online wallet or
exchange services (like LEOxChange),
their participation at the outset

entails linking their personal identity
to their digital currency holdings. A
digital currency for this type of user is
effectively no more anonymous than

a bank account. For example, to open

a digital currency wallet an individual
must conform to the same proof of
identity checks that an individual would
go through to open a bank account, i.e.
proof of ID, address, etc.

Digital currency transactions can

then be anonymous, since real-world
identities are not recorded on the
blockchain ledger: the only identifying
information recorded there are the
Bitcoin addresses, whose corresponding
private keys are held by the owners as
proof of ownership.

A further source of potentially
deanonymizing information is available
to every computer that participates

in the decentralized transaction
network by hosting a digital currency
‘node’ This information is the set of
Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of the
computers that announce new digital
currency transactions. So the computer
where the coin was generated could be
traced back to its IP address, however
not necessarily the user.

The new encryption features of letters and numbers that make no sense
LEOcoin’s blockchain means that every unless you know how to turn it back to
move that is recorded in the ledger is its original state. Think of it as a locked

Is digital currency the criminal’s friend or foe?

Jason Weinstein, a partner at Steptoe & Johnson LLP and a former deputy assistant
attorney general in the US Department of Justice, in charge of cybercrime and
organized crime, gave a recent speech on digital currency in relation to criminal
use.

He says a user's Bitcoin address is like an account number that stays with the user;
if you can connect that address to a user, you can identify and trace all of the
transactions in which that individual has participated using that address.

As with banks, law enforcement would be able to obtain information about the
address user by serving a subpoena or following other lawful process. There are
existing and rapidly improving techniques to help link those users to their Bitcoin
addresses and transactions using, among other things, analysis of transaction
patterns to make connections among multiple addresses used by the same
individual; mining of data from social media and public sources; and analysis of IP
addresses used to conduct transactions.

He added that there’s also a real attribution advantage: the traceability, search
ability, and permanence of the blockchain. Whether a law enforcement agent
identifies the owner of an address tomorrow or two years from tomorrow, the
agent will then be able to trace back every transaction involving that address, all
the way back to the beginning.

Moreover, because the ledger is publicly accessible, law enforcement does not
have to worry about what type of legal process is required to access the data, and
because the ledger is borderless, law enforcement can get the data without having
to go through a foreign government. That gives law enforcement the data it needs
to ‘follow the money’ in a way that would never be possible with cash.

Law enforcement is still on a learning curve with Bitcoin, although the case against
Carl Force IV, the former Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent convicted
of stealing bitcoins during the Silk Road investigation, demonstrates that even at
this early stage, law enforcement has already developed an impressive capacity to
follow the money using the blockchain.

of functionality that will allow them to
use these new encryption features to‘go
private’ This method will allow the user
to choose to trade their currency in an
even more secure form — something that
no other digital currency offers.

Every wallet will start with two
addresses, one public and one private
(also known as Stealth address). The
public address will work in exactly
the same way that other digital
currency transactions work - publicly
recording the user’s pseudonymous
information and the transaction
history of every LEOcoin. However,
choosing the private option, launches
‘Ring of Trust Technology, which
essentially creates and confirms the
transaction on the blockchain without
publishing potentially identifiable
details. This model is called Dual-key
Stealth Addresses and it keeps users’
information safe by not recording any
pseudonymous information.

Stealth addresses are generated in

a different way than normal ‘Bitcoin’
addresses, but they have a similar
structure. A dual-key stealth address
contains a lot more information because
it requires the sender of a transaction to
know the public scan key and the public
spend key, which is not stored on the
blockchain. All data required to perform
such a transaction is derivable from the
stealth address itself.

The payer derives a new, normal address
from the Stealth address, to which the
funds will be sent and in that process
only allows the payee to compute the
corresponding private key. This is based
on the mathematical principle called

the ‘Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange’ It
allows two entities to generate a shared
secret based on their keypairs. Like with
the famous Enigma machine, it did not
matter if you had the code for either end
of the transmission, if you didn’t have
the source code the Enigma machine
was using, you could not translate

it. With the Stealth address system

even a super computer like Colossus
cannot crack it.

Essentially, the coins are destroyed after
they are sent from the original wallet
and created anew before they arrive
with the recipient (meaning the process
cannot be reverse engineered).

What's more, LEOcoin’s new privacy
functions include a private messenger
function so that traders can
communicate with the utmost privacy as
well as trade privately.

All messages are encrypted by the
proven AES-256-CBC algorithm, and
distributed between nodes. Even if
the ‘assailants’ could view the entire
network the message information
would remain private due to the
aforementioned encryption.

Conclusion

Average users and regulators should
be aware that trading in digital
currency using standard functionality
is certainly less ‘anonymous’ than
cash, but more so than conventional
online fiat transaction. However,
dedicated users can make specific
transactions anonymous through the
use of LEOcoin’s new privacy settings.
However, the open nature of the
transaction ledger makes it extremely
difficult for the user to achieve absolute
anonymity, unless on a limited scale
using LEOcoin’s new technology.

In summary, the consumer advantages
of instant, secure, international
transaction are considerable. - Yes, there
are opportunities to exploit the system,
much as there are with existing forms
of fiat transaction, but the security
concerns presented by the supposed
anonymity of digital currencies are
largely overblown.

Furthermore, law enforcement agencies
have largely caught up with people
using it for criminal purposes and have
been able to discover information
about transactions where relevant to a
criminal act.

However the new level of privacy
offered by LEOcoin’s upgrade, will offer
our users an added level of protection.
The right for consumers to privacy
must always be considered - and that
is why LEOcoin has introduced this new
feature for its users.

Our private feature ‘The Upgrade’
protects our users’ identities at a

time when identity theft, the right to
anonymity and privacy in the digital age
is at the forefront of public attention.

The rapid pace of technological
development enables individuals all
over the world to use new information
and communications technologies
(ICTs) to improve their lives. At the
same time, technology is enhancing the
capacity of governments, companies
and individuals to undertake
surveillance, interception and data
collection, which may violate or abuse
human rights, in particular the right
to privacy.

Article 8 of the European Convention
on Human Rights legislates for an
individual's ‘private and family life,

his home and his correspondence’,
subject to certain restrictions that are ‘in
accordance with law’ and ‘necessary in
a democratic society’ This article clearly
provides a right to be free of unlawful
searches, and mass surveillance
campaigns. Therefore anonymity in
conducting your financial affairs is

very much within the letter and spirit
of international laws. LEOcoin’s new
offering exemplifies this right.

Furthermore, a 2014 report to the
General Assembly of the United Nations
(UN) by the UN's top official for counter-
terrorism and human rights condemned
mass electronic surveillance as a

clear violation of core privacy rights
guaranteed by multiple treaties and
conventions and makes a distinction
between ‘targeted surveillance’ — which
‘depend[s] upon the existence of prior
suspicion of the targeted individual or
organization’ and — ‘mass surveillance’,
by which ‘states with high levels of
internet penetration can gain access to
the telephone and e-mail content of an
effectively unlimited number of users
and maintain an overview of internet
activity associated with particular
websites’ Only targeted interception

of traffic and location data in order

to combat serious crime, including
terrorism, is justified, according to

a decision by the European Court

of Justice. This should not include
legitimate businesses only seeking to
trade. Our new privacy settings will give
those traders a new level of security.

Anew resolution on the right to
privacy in the digital age, adopted on
21 November 2016 at the UN General
Assembly of the UN, comes at a time
when the rapid pace of technological
development is enhancing the capacity
of governments, companies and

individuals to undertake surveillance,
interception and data collection, which
may violate or abuse human rights, in
particular the right to privacy.

The UN policy links the right to
privacy with the exercise of freedom
of expression, as well as participation
in political, economic, social, and
cultural life, a framing that challenges
increasing identification of security
and surveillance by governments
and corporations.

At LEOcoin we have given our users
the ability to go private - because
that’s their right. With government
approval, or at least acquiescence,
legal businesses and users can take
advantage of the potential speed, low
costs, flexibility, and privacy offered by
LEOcoin and our contemporaries.

Glossary

Digital anonymity

Digital currencies are pseudonymous;
that is, sending and receiving digital
currency is like writing under a
pseudonym. If an author's pseudonym
is ever linked to their identity,
everything they have ever written
under that pseudonym will be linked
to them. In digital currency, your
pseudonym is the address at which
you receive it, and every transaction
involving that address is stored forever
in the blockchain. However, technology
is now available to undertake a financial
transaction anonymously by creating
and confirming the transaction on the
blockchain without publishing the
original sending address. Essentially,
the coins are destroyed after they

are sent from the original wallet and
created anew before they arrive with
the recipient.

Blockchain

Blockchain technology itself is nothing
new, it is just an encrypted database
that is distributed across a computer
network. What makes it possibly
revolutionary is that it can only be
updated when everyone on that
network agrees and once entered, the
information cannot be overwritten.

Proof of Stake

Initially LEOcoin used a hashing
algorithm (Scrypt-Jane) that gradually
increases the demand in RAM

(a computer's processing power).

This method is known as Proof of
Work, and in essence it meant the
more powerful a computer you had,
the more digital currency you could
mine. But not any longer. LEOcoin has
now moved to a Proof of Stake (POS)
model, which rather than rewarding
LEOcoin investors for the power their
computer lends to the network, instead
rewards LEOcoin users based on the
number of LEOcoin’s they currently hold
and ‘stake’ Essentially, this means the
more LEOcoin’s you have the more you
will earn.

This method is far less demanding on
computer power and in practical terms
that means the consumer and small
business owner does not need to invest
in an expensive and powerful machine
to mine LEOcoin. This makes LEOcoin
mining available to a wider mass-
market audience.

LEOcoin’s POS model also reduces the
risk of ‘Selfish Miner flaw’ and ‘51%
attacks’ Transactions in any digital
currency have to be approved and
verified by the peer-to-peer network.
This community approval means
everyone has a stake in the currency,
so it is in the community's interest to
ensure security.

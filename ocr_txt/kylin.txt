Version 1.0.0

Kylin Network aims to Build a Cross-chain Platform Powering the Data Economy on Polkadot.
It will be the Data Infrastructure for DeFi and Web 3.0 Powered by Polkadot.

The Open API and SDK of Kylin Network offers any applications and blockchains (such as
parachains and parathreads) instantaneous but transparent, reliable and valid on/off-chain market
data and social data sources by leveraging the power of Polkadot/Substrate Framework on open
networks. Kylin Network represents extensibility and a synergetic increase to the off-chain workers
capability as it will provide not only access, management, insights, coordination to a greater array of
data sources, but bolster validity and decentralization of the data sources themselves. We believe
that it is only via Polkadot/Substrate Framework that we can ensure a cost effective solution
that data consumers and Dapp Builders will actually use over centralized sources. Kylin Network,

therefore, hopes to achieve complementarity and synergy with Substrate Framework while providing

valid, reliable, secure, cost effective and easily-coordinated data sourcing and data analytics.

The architecture of Kylin Network includes the below four major components:

e Kylin Data Analytics is a combination of analytic tools designed for data warehouses. It
extracts meaningful data findings, patterns, interpretation, and finally implements low-cost
commercialization functionalities for the public. It also provides a query engine and RESTful
API for third-party applications (Dapps, Networks, etc.) or external analytics tools (BI tools,

Machine Learning, etc).

e Kylin Data Oracle is an advanced decentralized data feeding protocol powered by Polkadot
offering multiple, real-time data sources with much lower cost. With complementarity to and
synergy with off-chain workers (OCW) as one kind of Oracle Node implementations, it can
better guarantee the security and accuracy of external data by verifying the data integrity

and the validity that Oracle Node provided.

e Kylin Data Marketplace is an open platform for data exchange and pricing. Dapps built on
Polkadot can easily and efficiently collect both off-chain and on-chain data, only paying a very

competitive fee. Kylin seeks to extend the data provisional resources across all possible data

types/sources including but not limited to things like social media posts, flight information,

exchange rates, weather reporting, etc.
e Kylin Token KYL is the native token of Kylin Network which will play the role of gov-
ernance and other utilities. KYL is necessary to secure and power the decentralized data

network.

KYL is the native token of Kylin Network with 1 billion total supply, and its distribution would

be completed via ERC20 and testnet before the mainnet launches.

I. Consensus Mechanism

1.1 NPoS consensus algorithm

Kylin protocol, which is based on Substrate technology, adopts the NPoS (Nominated Proof-of-
Stake) consensus algorithm. There are two parties engaged in the maintenance and security mech-
anism of the chain: validators and nominators. Validators run nodes that are responsible for the
production and confirmation of blocks, while Nominators, by Staking their tokens, are entitled to
nominate trusted validators to obtain Staking rewards.

As for the operation of the NPoS consensus, Kylin is considering two solutions: 1) Becoming a
parachain on Polkadot by participating in Polkadot’s card slot auction; 2) Recruiting validators to
run an independent chain.

Both solutions have their pros and cons, but we prefer the former, as it will take us a step
further to our goal of building a cross-chain oracle.

As a proviso, Kylin is in general working with a dynamic and cutting-edge context, so what

may seem best practice today, may not be best practice tomorrow, and as such we must inform
that some of the details and perhaps even fundamentals of what we lay out may be subject to

fine-tuning and change.

1.2 Inflation rate

Under the NPoS consensus mechanism, the rewards for validators and nominators mainly come
from the further issuance of tokens, which is also the main reason that underlies the inflation. The
inflation rate cannot be adjusted by any party, except by the automatic algorithm. The formula of

the NPoS inflation model is as below:

. I
In tx (édeat _ 2) for 0 <a < Xideal

Inpos(x) = , and

Tp + (Jideat * Xideat — Io) + 20%¢8'—)/4 for Xidead <@ <1
i(x) = Inpos/2.

In the formula, yideq is the expected, or ideal staking rate of the Kylin network; Iigeqi is the

expected annualized rate of return, which represents the annual return(APR) that a nominator

can enjoy when the ideal Staking rate is in place; Ro represents the inflation rate when the Staking
rate is 0, which is literally the default inflation rate; and d represents the attenuation rate of the
inflation rate.

Kylin Network regards the ideal Staking rate as 60%. If it is too high, the circulation and use

of KYL tokens will be restrained. If too high, only limited tokens will be used for real utility. If too

low, the security of the chain cannot be guaranteed. On top of that, when the Staking rate reaches
60%, the annualized rate of return will be 12%, which is a reasonable figure, striking a balance
between the inflation rate and the Staking incentives.

Therefore, the parameters of the above formula is set as below:

e Expected Staking rate: xideal = 0.6
e Expected annualized rate of return: Ijgeqy = 0.12
e The inflation rate when the Staking rate is 0: Ro = 0.025

e Attenuation rate d = 0.02

A balanced dynamics of staking rate and staking APR can be achieved when the parameters

are set as above:

e When the Staking rate is less than 60%, the average annualized RoR of Staking is greater

than 12%, so more tokens will be Staked.

e When the Staking rate is equal to 60%, the average annualized rate of return of Staking is
12%.
e When the Staking rate is greater than 60%, and the average annualized return rate is lower

than 12%, then redemption instead of staking is encouraged by the system.

The following figure shows the relationship between the simulated inflation rate, Staking rate,

and annualized rate of return:

In the figure above, the X-axis is the Staking rate, the blue line is the annual inflation rate, and

the green line is the annualized rate of return.

1.3 Block rewards

Every time a block is produced on the Kylin mainnet, the system will issue a certain amount
of KYL tokens as rewards. The reward size is determined by the real-time inflation rate of the
network. The inflation rate is determined by a formula, and so it is not a dynamic value affected
by the Staking rate of the network.

Block rewards are distributed by the following rules:

e 80% to validators and nominators.

e 20% stored in the Kylin Treasury, which will fund community growth, project development,

incentives, etc.
1.4 Block slash

When a validator commits malicious behavior, such as off-line, double-signing, etc., they will be
punished in the form of the confiscation of certain amounts of KYL from Staked tokens and nomi-
nators’ assets.

The amount of Slash penalties is affected by the status of the network. For example, if the
off-line rate of the entire network is high, then the corresponding Slash for a single validator will
be graver, too. The case is the same in terms of double-signing as well.

In extreme cases, for example, when more than one-third of validators have double-signed, then
100% of the Staked tokens will be Slashed.

1.5 Treasury

In order to ensure the sustainable development and decentralization of the protocol, Kylin has
set up a Treasury to motivate individuals or teams to contribute to the project. Any use of the
Treasury must be approved through online governance, and developers can publicize their proposals
to the public. Once a proposal is passed by voters, it will be financially supported by the Treasury.

In the early stage of Kylin, Treasury will mainly support in the following aspects:

e Project Development - Motivating data providers, oracle contract developers and product

testers, etc.

e On-chain governance - Encouraging the development of on-chain development tools, the com-

munity participation in on-chain voting governance, etc.

e Developer incentives - For example, Kylin can delegate to the community the development of

block explorers, dashboards, data oracles, and contributors can be supported by the Treasury.

e Kylin Ecosystem Establishment - Incentivizing behaviors that make Kylin’s ecosystem more
flourishing, such as short-term incentives when accessing different DeFi protocols, technical

research, or publicity around the future development of Kylin, etc.

The revenue sources of Treasury mainly come from the following two aspects:

1. Part of the data usage fee: When users use Kylin data services, 20% of the service fee will be

added to the Treasury.

2. Part of the block reward: 20% of the block reward will be added to Treasury.

1.6 On-chain governance

Any decision regarding the use of Treasury funds will be made by Kylin’s on-chain governance forum
in the future. That is to say, the community can vote with their KYL tokens on the governance

of the Treasury. However, in the early stage of Kylin, the team believes that it may disappoint
everyone if we blindly pursue decentralized governance. Therefore, during the early phase, the
Treasury governance will be led by the foundation, which is represented by the Kylin team, and

assisted by the community.

II. System Overview

Kylin Network will be divided into two parts: chain and application. The chain mainly protects the
security and consensus mechanism of the network, while the application refers to the decentralized
cross-chain data service.

Two roles are involved in the chain part: Validators and Nominators.

1) If you connect to the Polkadot parachain, the rewards issued by the system will be given
to the Validators in the Polkadot ecosystem, and Nominators will participate in nominating Kylin
Network through the Polkadot chain.

2) If you build the mainnet by yourself, Kylin will recruit Validator nodes from the community
and distribute the block rewards to the recruited Validators. Nominators will participate in the

nomination of Validators through Kylin’s mainnet.

Either way, Stakers are required to pledge KYL tokens and use the NPoS algorithm to calculate
the inflation rate based on the Staking rate.
As for the application part, the main challenge for Kylin is to establish a secure and decentralized

cross-chain data service. The business logic will be introduced in the following passages.

III. Data Ecosystem

3.1 Main participants of the network
1) Oracle Programmer

Oracle Programmer (OP) is responsible for establishing a data index algorithm on Kylin, which
is responsible for publishing Oracle Script. Oracle Script is an executable program that tells the
Miner what and how to index, as well as how to create and output the results. OP can publish any
Oracle Script that is considered valuable on the Kylin network. For example, if an OP is interested
in the price of cryptocurrencies, it can publish a data index algorithm on how to index prices and
provide quotes. Another OP, who believes that the Oracle Script of the New York weather forecast
will have great value, can publish information on how to index weather updates and output a fair

value.

2) Consumers

Consumers are the demanders of Kylin’s data services. They can select and consume, with KYL

tokens, the data service through various Oracle Scripts published by OP on Kylin.
3) Miners

Miners are responsible for running the index algorithm according to the Oracle Script selected by
the user. They encode the original data and continuously provide data to the Oracle center, and
finally aggregate an on-chain data package that will be provided to the Consumer. Miners will be

randomly selected from the Validator whitelist.

4) Arbitrators

When a Miner provides data to the Oracle center, it needs to be verified by Arbitrators first. Only
the data that is verified will become valid quotation data. Arbitrators will be served by members
of the governance committee in the Kylin network. If a Miner is found to be engaging in malicious

behaviour, its deposits will be counterfeited and then distributed to Arbitrators.

5) Data Providers

The data providers are the source of the most primitive data, such as CoinGecko and Coinmarketcap
in the quotation oracle, or the New York weather station in weather forecast oracle. Anyone with
data can become a Data Provider and obtain query income.

3.2 Proposal overview

The overview of Kylin’s oracle data business is shown in the figure below, which can be divided

into 5 steps:

Script
| Choose at

Random

Oracle Script

Verified according to VRF
1) Step 1: A Consumer chooses Oracle Script(s)

A Consumer can choose one or more Oracle Scripts through the Oracle Script Market of the Kylin
Network client, and make payment in KYL tokens to request to query a certain data value.

In the early stage, the Kylin team will release the Oracle Script on quotes of cryptocurrencies,
because this is the first application scenario for Kylin. Later, we will open the permission to publish
Oracle Script to the community, which will publish any Oracle Script that it considers valuable. A
user who publishes Oracle Script is called an Oracle Programmer. Once a user publishes an Oracle

Script, the Oracle Programmer will have the opportunity to earn from the user’s query fee.

2) Step 2: Assign Miners

After receiving the Consumer’s query request, the Kylin Oracle Center will immediately code
different validators on the chain according to the VRF random algorithm, and then select them
through random number generation. The selected ones will become the Miners who execute the
Oracle Script.

The system will tend to give priority to validators with more popular nominations and code for
them, because they have a larger number of locked KYL tokens. For them, the cost of performing
malicious acts is high. However, we will ensure that every validator stands a chance to be selected

as a Miner.

3) Step 3: Miners execute the query task

Miners execute the Oracle Script algorithm contract, querying multiple Data Sources indexed by
the Script algorithm for raw data, request random numbers according to the Verifiable Random
Function (VRF) algorithm, and then finally quote to Kylin’s oracle center. The VRF algorithm
ensures that Miner will not engage in malicious actions collectively to paralyze the quotation system.

More details will be shown below.

4) Step 4: Data verification

The Arbitrators in the Kylin network will verify the random number uploaded by each Miner. Only
the data provided by the verified Miner is considered valid. Miners who upload invalid data will

have their Staked KYL tokens confiscated and collected by the Reward pool.

5) Step 5: Data aggregation and uploading

The off-chain module of Kylin oracle packs the final data result through the aggregation algorithm
based on the index data provided by each Miner from various data sources. Thereafter, the final
result will be uploaded to the Kylin Oracle center and stored permanently there. Consumers can

have access to this data.
At the same time, the system will generate a data proof for the data query result, which contains
the data result, upload time, corresponding Oracle Script hash, and other information. The proof
will be recorded on the Kylin Network chain for future queries.

Regarding the aggregation algorithm, Kylin will enable user customization on aggregation meth-
ods. For example, you can choose the average, the median, or the weighted average value. Currently,
Kylin’s algorithm will first eliminate outliers, such as data fluctuations of more than 20% in the

same event, in order to ensure data security.

3.3 Network incentives

In the network, KYL tokens play a very important role. There are two token distribution modules

in the system.

<__ Kylin Block Reward 0% Reward ae

| 70% Reward
20% Nominate KYL

<—e 7
a Send KYL

& Data Provider

1) Consensus mechanism module with block reward as the core

In this module, major participants are Validators, Arbitrators and Nominators. The block reward

distribution ratio is as follows:

e The nominators who nominate the Validator by Staking KYL will be distributed 70% of the

block reward.

e Arbitrators will obtain 10% block reward through the verification service of Miner for the

Kylin chain.

e The remaining 20% block rewards will be transferred to the Treasury for project development.
2) Business module with data service fees as its core

A Consumer needs to pay KYL tokens for query services. The main participants are Miner, Oracle

Programmer, Data Provider, Team, and Treasury. The distribution ratio is as follows:

e Miners undertake a large amount of data indexing and calculation work, and will receive 45%

rewards from the KYL tokens paid by Consumers.

e Oracle Programmer is the creator of the data index algorithm used when users query data,

and will receive 15% of the rewards.

e As the source of data, Data Provider will receive a 10% query fee as an incentive to provide

high-quality data source.
e The Treasury will collect 20% of the rewards for the continuous development of the project.

e As the promoter of the project, the Kylin team will get 10% of the rewards as an incentive.

The distribution method in the above framework can be adjusted through community gover-

nance in the future.

IV. Security Mechanism

4.1 Decentralized data source

It is an important prerequisite for the network security of Kylin oracle to ensure the decentralization
and data security of data providers. Kylin Network will first invite some well-known Data Providers,
such as Coinmarketcap, CoinGecko, Coinbase, etc. At the same time, anyone can apply to become
a Data Provider through its registration page where all info will be reviewed. For data providers
that have passed the review, the data they publish will be officially released on Kylin Network for
the Miners to index.

For the same Oracle Script, we will guarantee at least 3 high-quality Data Providers to ensure

the decentralization of data sources.

4.2 VRF algorithm using verifiable random function

An essential part of Kylin’s oracle system is the assignment of random numbers to Miners, ensuring

their absolute randomness and effectiveness. Only if absolute randomness and fairness are guar-

anteed will the data uploaded by Miners be considered as not being malicious. Assuming that the
random number generator used by Kylin is compromised or can be predicted, the malicious nodes
can be elected as Miners that account for most of the panel by predicting the random numbers or
controlling the random number generator. In the worst cases, the oracle will be totally occupied.
Therefore, how the security and unpredictability of the random number generator is ensured is of

great significance for ensuring the security of data.
In order to avoid the collective fraudulent behaviour of Miners, Kylin will use the Verifiable
Random Function (VRF) algorithm to ensure the absolute security and verification of the random
number generation process. In the VRF algorithm, elliptic curve encryption and zero-knowledge
proof algorithms are used to ensure the verifiability, uniqueness and randomness of random number
generation.

VRE algorithm can be divided into three parts:

1) Function G that generates public and private key pairs

Assuming that the base point of the elliptic curve is O and the order is n, the public-private key
pair generation algorithm is as follows:
Al: Choose a random number
k= [1,n-]

A2: Generate a pair of elliptic curve keys, where the private key is k and the public key is
Y =kO

2) Function F that generates random number and proof

Input: message m, private key k.
Output: random number v, proof.
Bl: Choose a random number
r=([ln-J

B2: Use the hash function h1 to calculate H=h1(m), and map the message m to a point H on
the elliptic curve.
B3: Calculate rH, rO.

B4: Use the function h2 to encode the input into an integer s, and
s = (rH,rO)
B5: calculation
t=(r—sx*xk) modn

B6: calculation
V=kH

B7: Use the function h3 to encode the point on the elliptic curve into an integer, obtain the

random number value=h3(V), and prove that the proof is (V;t;s).

3) Verification function V

Input: message m’, proof proof’
Output: legitimacy (valid or invalid)
C1: Use the hash function hl to map the message m’ to a point H’ on the elliptic curve.
C2: calculation

U, =t'H'+s8'v'

U2=tO0+s8'Y

C3: Calculation
= h2(U1, U2)

C4: If s = s’, it indicates that the random number is valid and the verification is passed, and
the output is valid; otherwise, it indicates that the random number is invalid and the verification
is not passed, and the output is invalid.

In Kylin’s VRF algorithm, the system requires the Miner’s private key as the input value k
used to request the random number. kH can be calculated through the elliptic algorithm formula,
and be encoded into an integer Value as the final output random number. The process guarantees
the uniqueness of the private key of the Miner. Meanwhile, the elliptic algorithm function has the
features of hash functions, ensuring the uniqueness and randomness of the random integer Value.

The random number verification requires Miners to submit proof. Even if a certain Miner is
compromised, the result of the data output won’t be manipulated or affected, because it cannot
pass the encryption verification on the chain. When the Miner fails to submit Proof during the
verification process, it will be arbitrated by Arbitrators in the network, and the Staked KYL tokens

will be confiscated. The failed Miner’s credentials will also be recorded in the network.

4.3 On-chain arbitration mechanism

Kylin’s VRF algorithm contract can be divided into three parts: the public and private key gen-
eration contract, the random number and proof contract, and the verification contract, as given

below:

e Keygen(r) + (VK,SK). The key generation algorithm generates a pair of verification
public key VK and private key SK from a random input.

e Evaluate(SK,X) — (Y,p). The evaluation algorithm takes the private key SK and mes-

sage X as input, and outputs a pseudo-random string Y and evidence p.

e Verify(VK,X,Y,p) — 0/1. The verification algorithm will verify the public key VK,
message X, output Y, and evidence p as input. If and only if it verifies that Y is the output

generated from the input SK and X by the evaluation algorithm will the output be 1.

In order to ensure that the VRF contract is decentralized and not controlled by a single point,
we will select a group of special validators as Arbitrators, who will be responsible for running the
VRF algorithm contract and verifying the random number, which is uploaded by the Miner, and
the Proof.
When a Miner’s random number cannot be verified, or a Miner cannot submit the random
number and Proof within a specific period, Arbitrators will initiate a Challenge, which will be
recorded on the Kylin blockchain and will be tamper-proof. This is to maintain the traceability of
the system.

When Arbitrators challenge a Miner, the Kylin system will automatically calculate the number
of Miners in the Challenge state and the Challenge history of that Miner. The number of KYL

tokens that will be confiscated is determined by the above factors.

Miners who have not been verified will be blacklisted and permanently removed from the Miner
whitelist. In the future, they will not be able to participate in the Kylin network or receive rewards.
4.4 Security deposits
1) Miners

Validators whose Self-bond amount exceeds 100,000 KYL tokens can apply to join the Miner
whitelist. Arbitrators will check the data uploaded by the Miner. If malicious acts are found,

the Staked KYL tokens will be fined. The fines will be calculated by the following formula:
min ((3k/n)?, 1)

n is the total number of Miners, and k is the number of challenged miners in an Era. If the
number of evil miners in the current network exceeds 1/3 of the total, all nodes’ Staked KYL tokens

will be Slashed. Slashed KYL tokens will become Arbitrators’ reward.

2) Arbitrators

In order to ensure fairness for all Arbitrators, Kylin will initially designate 21 reputable nodes to
serve as Arbitrators, whose information will be released to the public. There are two ways to recruit

Arbitrators:

e We can randomly choose from validators, but we have already done that for miners, which

stands the opposite side of arbitrators.

e We can choose some certain nodes to run it, so it is better for some notable institutions to

join in, which has a slight chance to do evil things.

After these foundational nodes are established, we will begin our 100 validators program, and
iterate to the 1000 validators program. The details for these will be released later.

Each Arbitrator needs to Stake at least a number of KYL tokens (e.g. 500,000) in the Kylin
Network contract. While running the VRF algorithm contract, Arbitrators can obtain rewards by
verifying and Challenging Miners.

However, due to the margin system and strict Slash policy, Miners’ malicious behavior may

happen in extremely rare cases and the Arbitrators may not be fully incentivized. So, Kylin will
add 10% of the block reward to the Arbitrator’s rewards pool, and calculate the basic reward based
on the proportion of KYL tokens deposited by Arbitrators.

In addition, we will also establish an online evaluation system to score the performance of
Arbitrators, evaluating their online duration, the number of challenges initiated, etc. Those factors
will translate into the Arbitrator’s income (in the form of KYL tokens). If an extreme event occurs,
such as the online duration being less than 1/3 of the requirement, the Arbitrator’s Staked KYL

token will be deducted and it will be disqualified.

V. Governance Structure

Kylin Network is about addressing the needs of demanding users. This means delivering quality,
security, speed, predictability and transparency.

Considerations for Governance Priorities

e Maximise participation

Prevent dominance by single parties

Provide decentralised security

Facilitate cohesion in order to prevent forking

Stability of the protocol

Facilitate inclusion in decision-making

Perception of all above.

The Kylin Network Board is supervised by the third-party authorities, with a clear purpose
defined in its Public Deed. The Board is tasked with ensuring that the Kylin Network protocol
continues to develop and remain relevant to the needs of users within the parameters of the project’s

purpose.

$KYL Stakeholders will assume a central role in suggesting and determining the priorities of
Kylin Network through the Governance Committee, whilst the Board will act as guarantor that the
Kylin Network principles of privacy with accountability and the Public Deed of the Kylin Network
Project are adhered to.

The Project Board will retain the role as supreme body of the Project after full decentralization,

but key functions will be delegated to the Governance Committee. Decentralisation is in five steps:

e Pre-mainnet

The Kylin Network Board will appoint a Governance Committee with five members to oversee
the governance decentralization process, on-chain governance mechanisms, tokenomics & inflation.

Governance Committee 100% appointed by Kylin Network Board
e Stable mainnet +1 year

$KYL Stakeholders appoint two members of the Governance Committee by on-chain vote,
expanding the Committee from five to seven members. The Governance Committee can propose
changes to the protocol on-chain. 28,6% of the Governance Committee is appointed by the $KYL
Stakeholders.

e Stable mainnet +2 years

$KYL Stakeholders appoint two further members of the Governance Committee by on-chain
vote, expanding the Committee from seven to nine members. Stakeholders can propose changes
to the protocol and vote for the changes on-chain. The Governance Committee will oversee the
implementation and ordering of decisions made by the Stakeholders. 44,4% of the Governance

Committee is appointed by $KYL Stakeholders.

e Stable mainnet +3 years

$KYL Stakeholders appoint two members of the Governance Committee by on-chain vote,
replacing two of the initial five Committee members. Committee total membership remains at
nine members, with two seats up for election every year. $KYL Stakeholders can implement
changes to the protocol. The Governance Committee acts as the executor of decisions passed by
the Stakeholders. 66,6% of the Governance Committee is appointed by $KYL Stakeholders.

e Stable mainnet +4 years

100% of the Governance Committee will be appointed by $KYL Stakeholders.

VI. Token Value Captured

6.1 Utilities of KYL token

The Kylin Network native token KYL is necessary to secure and power the decentralized data

network. The use-cases and utility of KYL include but not limited to:

e Stake to be a Miner or Arbitrator: All miners are required to stake KYL with a higher

stake equating in a high probability of being selected to fulfill data requests.

e Intermediary of Exchange: KYL token will be used to pay as a transaction, query fee,

and also for data access behind paywall (private APIs).

e On-chain Governance: KYL token holders are able to vote for the protocol upgrades and

parameter changes on Kylin Network.

e Purchase Data Services: KYL token can be used for a contract-based data exchange

infrastructure for data feeding, data querying and data analytics.
6.2 Value captured by KYL token

The value captured by KYL is the increase of data economy contributed by Kylin Network com-

ponents.

e Decentralization and security of data services
e Off-chain and on-chain data resources

e Insights and added value from Data Exchange

Besides, the core value captured based on smart contracts is trustless and permissionless for

any participants.

6.3 Ecosystem resources

e On-chain Data: It will display a comprehensive range of on-chain metrics, from the basic
on-chain dormant, active, hyperactive addresses, block heights, block size, and fees to the

different types of UTXO values and transactions.

e Off-chain Data: Off-chain data is any non-transactional data that does not exist in the
blockchain, or requires the ability to be changed or deleted. It includes but is not limited to
things like social media posts, flight information, exchange rates, stock market price, weather

reporting, etc.

e Data Services: It handles a variety of services including data virtualization, analysis,
pattern-forming. It centralizes and monitors metrics for management, reuse of data types,

and enforce data visibility and access rules.

e Data Exchange: Data exchange encompasses services from pricing, offering medium of

exchange, creating a marketplace to the final change hands and communication of data.

6.4 Application scenarios

e Decentralized Insurance Automatic Payment: Through the Kylin Network to obtain
timely and reliable events outside the insured chain, blockchain-based decentralized insurance

can realize automatic payment of insurance such as flight delay insurance.

e Stable Coins and Crypto Derivatives: Stablecoins and encrypted derivatives need to
frequently obtain off-chain real-time price data. Kylin Network can obtain reliable data in

multiple scenarios in real time and efficiently.

e Crypto Asset Lending Platform: Kylin Network can provide real-time and reliable cur-
rency prices and borrower’s social media information, providing strong support for the dy-

namic determination of loan interest rates.
e Cross-chain Decentralized Exchange: The lightweight Kylin Network interface that can
be deployed on multiple chains provides the possibility for decentralized exchanges to realize

cross-chain atomic transactions.

e Decentralized Casinos and Games: On-chain decentralized casinos and games often
require safe and reliable random injection. Kylin Network random number engine provides

unpredictable and verifiable random number generation.

e Blockchain Computing Market: Commercial computing such as machine learning train-
ing models and 3D rendering needs to complete a variety of complex computing tasks. The

off-chain computing market provides verifiable and unlimited off-chain computing capabilities.

VII. Community Engagement
Kylin’s current community engagement strategies include:

e Exposure on Leading Media Channels: We will release additional articles on Forbes,

The Block, CoinDesk, CoinTelegraph and many other leading media channels.

e Ecosystem Development Lead Program: We will launch an Ecosystem Development
Lead Program to recruit and get more technology and development contributors involved

into our project.

e Promotion of Online and Offline Events: We will publish an article on medium upon
the progress of this project. Meanwhile, we will join Polkadot related off-line events and do

online AMA sessions to promote the project to the Polkadot community.
Kylin’s future community engagement strategies include:

e Bounty Program for General Community: We will reward users who contribute pos-
itively to community building and content creation through an Ambassador Program. The
community management team will be available 24/7 to answer questions and facilitate dis-

cussions in community channels.

e Incentive Program for Dapp Developers: Kylin Network focuses on giving developer
support through both offline and online channels. Developers can integrate the data with only
a few lines of code. The simplicity of integrating this project makes it easy for any developer

to experiment.

e Mining Program for Node Runners: Kylin Network is targeting a global pool of 100
nodes upon the completed rollout of Kylin Network to achieve the highest degree of decen-
tralization as possible. Gradually, reputable and trusted public nodes will be onboard onto

this project to ensure the stability of the network.
e Incentive Program for Data Providers: After the main functions are completed, we
will set up an incentive program to encourage more market data and social data sources as

premium data providers for Kylin Network.

e IPO during Parachain Auction for Community Members: Kylin Network may hold

an Initial Parachain Offering (IPO) and reward users for helping our auction with KYL tokens.

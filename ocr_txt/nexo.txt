NEXO Token Terms

Why Is Nexo Issuing Tokens?

Instead of attracting capital from legacy financing sources that are only now beginning to appreciate the
potential of blockchain technologies, Nexo is opting for another solution. The company aims to increase of
awareness and gather generic support from the crypto community by letting its members participate directly
and transparently in the Token Sale. A well executed Token Sale provides essential funding that allows Nexo
to extend instant loans and meet the overwhelming demand from the blockchain community. The benefit
of global outreach and inclusivity of all people and potential investors to participate and become long-
standing Nexo supporters on a global scale is the very essence of the efforts of the blockchain technological
innovation. Furthermore the NEXO tokens are going to be used in multiple Airdrop campaigns that will
attract and retain loyal customers and supporters and represent a great incentive for them to explore the
possibilities of the Nexo platform at discounted rates. The Token Sale is an invigorating and efficient way to
raise funds, as it prompts the community members to reinvest into the sustainable growth of useful projects.

To further reward NEXO token holders, each NEXO token bears dividend-paying features.

Token Features

The NEXO Token is the world’s first US SEC-compliant dividend-paying asset-backed security token with
additional utility features, that will be offered as a security to qualified investors in accordance with US and
other laws. The NEXO Token is ERC20-compliant and embedded in the Ethereum blockchain as a smart

contract.

Security Features

Dividend-paying & Asset-backed Token

In return for their initial backing and ongoing support, NEXO Token holders will receive 30%
dividends from Nexo’s profits. Dividends are paid monthly in ETH and distributed proportionately
to all NEXO token holders, immediately when payment is sent to the dividend smart contract.

NEXO tokens are backed by the underlying assets of Nexo’s loan portfolio.

Compliant and Regulated

The management team behind NEXO has run a successful financial institution under strict
European Banking and Financial Services supervision and adheres to the highest regulatory
requirements for over 10 years. Continuing a prudent business conduct, the NEXO Token
complies with the US SEC rules and regulations pursuant to the US Securities Act Regulation

D Rule 506(c).

Utility Features

Interest Discount

The key utility feature of the NEXO token is the discount that token holders receive whenever

they repay the interest on their loans using the NEXO token.

Increased Loan Limits

Similar to BTC and ETH, NEXO tokens can also be used in the Nexo Wallet to obtain instant
financing based on the tokens’ value. Nexo further incentivizes the use of NEXO tokens in the

Wallet by offering discounts on the loan interest.

52.50% of NEXO tokens will be distributed to investors from the Nexo Token Sale.

Loan Funding Reserves

25% of NEXO tokens will be allocated towards the growth of the loan portfolio, once Nexo starts offering
additional Altcoins and Tokenized Asset-backed financing. There are over $500 million in loan requests as
of March 5, 2018 which are expected to increase further. Loan Funding Reserves will also be used to increase

the maximum loan limits. Tokens are subject to up to 12 months vesting with 6 months cliff.

Founders & Team

11.25% of NEXO tokens will be distributed to the founders and the team with a vesting structure that will
ensure that the team’s interests are aligned with those of the investors and that the team’s efforts will be
channeled towards the creation of a profitable and sustainable business: The Founders & Team tokens
will be subject to 48 months (4 years) vesting with 6 cliffs at each half-year (1/8 of all tokens vest every 6

months). Vesting is encoded in the smart contract.

Community Building & Airdrops

6% of NEXO tokens will be retained and used for community building and Airdrops. 10,000,000 NEXO
tokens have already been allocated. For the remaining tokens, an appropriate vesting structure has been
created in the smart contract in order to assure the appropriate usage of the tokens: 18 months (1.5 years)
vesting with 6 cliffs at each half-year (1/3 of all tokens mature every 6 months). These tokens will be used to
promote the Nexo loan services by engaging the crypto community, thus ensuring the long-term success

of the Nexo enterprise.

Advisors & Compliance

5.25% of NEXO tokens would be distributed to Nexo’s advisors, including the Board of Advisors, Legal, PR
and will be utilized for ensuring compliance with the complex, evolving and expansive regulatory framework

ona global scale. Tokens are subject to up to 12 months vesting.

Use of Proceeds:
From the Community to the Community

Nexo’s primary mission is to enable the community to enjoy its crypto-wealth without selling it. The team
firmly believes that the vast majority of the raised funds need to find their way back to the people that need
funding for meeting a short term obligation, seize an attractive investment opportunity or leverage their
business operations. Almost all of the funds contributed at the Nexo Token Sale will therefore be allocated
towards the funding of the World’s First Instant Loans. There already is huge demand from potential loan

clients, resulting in requests for over $500 million in loan requests as of March 5, 2018.

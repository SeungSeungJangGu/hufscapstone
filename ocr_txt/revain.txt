Abstract

This document describes the Revain platform, which
allows users to discuss various projects that have successfully
carried out an ICO. Our goal is to create an easy-to-use service
that would enable companies to receive constructive feedback
about their projects. Meanwhile, users will be able to share
their experience and learn from the experience of others.

Revain is the first review platform that implements the

blockchain technology in order to ensure feedback legitima-
cy and as a backbone for the economic model which ensures
that all feedback is genuine and legitimate.
Fragments of reviews are saved in the blockchain, which
guarantees that those comments can't be edited at a later
date. The internal token of the system, called RVN, helps mo-
tivate participants to take their reviews and all related actions
seriously.

In the beginning we plan to work with companies that
have already completed their crowdfunding or ICO phase, as
well as cryptocurrency exchanges. Later on, we plan to expand
by accessing the Gaming, E-commerce, FMCG and Booking
markets.

Introduction

A review site is a website on which reviews can be posted about people, businesses,
products, or services.

Wikipedia "Review site"

The first review sites emerged as early as in the 1990s, the pioneer being Epin-
ions.com‘, founded in 1999. The project had a broad focus, participants could write re-
views for music, toys, computers etc. Over time, platforms focusing on a narrow range of
goods or services began to emerge, the most prominent examples being Yelp.com? (res-
taurants), TripAdvisor® (hotels), Rotten Tomatoes* (movies) and Angie's List? (small and
medium businesses).

Yelp Restraunts 2 200 000 000 $ 201 NYSE

TripAdvisor — Hotels 6 200 000 000 $ 238 No
Angie's list Local business 677 000 000 $ 4984 NASDAQ

The goal of such platforms is to make it possible for the people to share their opin-
ions on goods and services. In many cases these websites help businesses gather feed-
back from their customers.

However, even though this field has been present for over 20 years, a number of
fundamental problems remain unsolved.

Introduction

These problems can be divided into two groups.

a" How can participants be sure that the reviews are not
being edited or deleted?

When users post a review, they trust that the platform will not change, edit or delete
it. The problem we are facing here is a problem of trusting a third party.

% How can a company be sure that reviews are being written
by genuine clients and not competitors?

Doubtlessly, reviews on the internet are important and can impact the image of a
company. Besides the obvious function of feedback, reviews affect the popularity of the
business among new and potential clients. This eventually attracts competitors who will try
to tarnish the reputation of this rival. Meanwhile, companies have no way of knowing for
sure who writes the reviews.

Second problem - Economical

% User motivation

Writing a quality review is not a simple task. It requires time and effort, it involves de-
tailed descriptions of the pros and cons of a product and a conclusion. In the light of this,
the following question arises: “What does the author of the review receive as a reward for
their efforts?” Of course, there are people who do not need to be motivated to write a
review, and yet the majority of users would prefer to be compensated for their time.

% Review credibility

If there is no incentive to write reviews, could it be that some parts of reviews are cre-
ated by means of artificial intelligence? Nowadays it is not impossible to use artificial intel-
ligence to generate several hundred of short texts that would look like they were written
by a human, or simply just buy reviews.

Our platform implements several innovative technologies, most of which are based
on the blockchain technology. Smart contracts let us publicly save thousands of reviews,
thus making it impossible to delete or modify them. Our economic model involves the R
and RVN tokens and helps motivate users to leave only genuine feedback. In addition, we
use mathematical formulas for calculating bonuses that make submitting fake reviews
economically unprofitable.

Economical aspects

This section explains the functioning of the Revain platform from an economic stand-
point. A market analysis is provided along with reasons for using the two tokens and the
mechanics for conversion between R and RVN. In the end we present schematics for us-
er-to-platform and company-to-platform interaction. .

Market analysis

During the first stage of development our clients will be mainly companies that have
completed a successful ICO and their investors. According to Coinmarketcap, during the
summer of 2017 there were already more than 970 different tokens and currencies.
Around 15% of those were created using funds raised in the process of an ICO.

According to our analysis, there are roughly 8,000 investors per ICO, which means
that even now our client base consists of around 150 projects and 30,000 users (given that
at least 50% of the clients are participating in only one ICO at a time).

Economical aspects

The amounts raised can range from $1, 5 million to $100 million per ICO on average.
We should also take into account the non-transparent legal status of many companies
and the almost complete lack of control from most governments.

In this situation, our product is capable of providing proper means of communica-
tion between post-ICO companies and investors.

Two tokens (R and RVN)

Our project is different from most other blockchain projects since two tokens are re-
quired for the system to function properly. By using both tokens it is possible to create a
so called stable coin which can be used as an internal mechanism vital to the functioning
of the platform.

Token R will be used to gather funds during ICO, as well as a currency for exchange
trading later on. Judging from the experience of other blockchain projects, this token will
be highly volatile due to the speculative nature of the market nowadays. (The data pre-
sented below is relevant as of July 2017).

Avg. volume Max change Change for
Name Segment per June ‘17 (24h) permonth (BTC) all time

Economical aspects

The RVN token will be used exclusively inside the Revain system. This approach
allows for a stable exchange rate. All interactions between the platform, users and compa-
nies is based on this approach, specifically:

« Rewarding users for quality reviews;
* Debiting companies (in tokens) for written reviews;

+ Penalizing companies for deliberate unconstructive moder-
ation of reviews;

* Penalizing users for noncompliance with the Rules of the

rvn token °°"
Tokens conversion

R tokens are created in a limited supply during the crowdfunding phase, while RVN
ensures the functioning of the whole system. We understand, that as more and more
people use our platform, the demand for the R token will become higher than the supply
(since the number of R tokens is limited), and it's price on exchanges will start to grow.
Since the reason for the creation of two tokens is ensuring the stability of the RVN ex-
change rate, the main requirement for the conversion is the possibility of leveling volatility.
The currency rate of RVN should not be affected by the market and the rate of the R token
in particular.

To accomplish this, we have decided to make 1 RVN equal to 0.0001 BTC. Exchange
of tokens at any time will be executed based on the following formula:

_ Rvalue (in BTC)
1R token 0, 0001 RVN tokens

Accordingly, the rate of token R is calculated with a backward version of the above
formula. Token exchange will happen within the platform, no fee shall be charged.

Economical aspects

Company usage

We focus on providing companies with quality feedback from customers. And since
the user needs to be motivated to give quality feedback, the company’s account is debit-
ed for each review received. This fee is called Review Fee (RF) and consists of two parts:

Review fee (RF) = User reward (UR) + Platform fee (PF)
Platform fee - a fee paid to the platform. It is our main way of monetization.
User reward - a (possible) reward for the user for writing a quality review.

The amounts of PF and UR are calculated every time when a review is submitted. Calcu-
lation mechanics and formulas are listed below (UR formula is above in the section “User
usage").

Revain fee
While developing the RF formula we had to address two issues:

1. Develop a model that would make the purchase or artificial generation of big
amounts of reviews economically unprofitable.

2. Develop a system that would allow small companies to afford to reward users
for reviews.

We were able to find solutions thanks to the nonlinear dependency of RF on the total
number of reviews written in the past two weeks. The overall trend is the following - the
more reviews there are, the bigger the value of RF. Two weeks after the submission of the
last review a rollback will occur, setting RF at its minimal value:

The maximum value of RF is limited to 10 RVN, otherwise the total value of RF would
be bigger than the value of the whole emission after only 200 new reviews have been sub-
mitted.

. Ms)" 1 RVN,x < 90
RF (x=review number per last 2 weeks =

10 RVN, x 2 90

Economical aspects

The total amount of RF depending on the number of reviews in the past two weeks
can be calculated with this formula:

k
Total amount of tokens per k reviews = > RF(n) RVN
n=1
Here are a few examples. (The RVN/BTC exchange rate is calculated as 1/0,0001). It
is supposed that all reviews have been added in the past two weeks:

Amount of Total (RVN) Total (BTC)
reviews
10 12 0, 0012
50 100 0, 01
100 444 0, 0444
500 4444 0, 4444

Our platform is also different from other similar projects since we allow companies
to set up their own metrics for assessing review quality. For example, a restaurant might
require their reviewers to attach a photo of a waiter standing next to a table. If no photo
has been submitted, the review will be rejected during automatic filtration.

User usage

Users are motivated to write quality reviews by the possibility of token rewards taken
from the company’s account. This amount is taken from the Revain fee and is calculated
with the following formula:

User reward = (0,9 * Revain fee)

Currently a user is allowed to submit up to 5 reviews per day. In the future we plan
to implement user ratings, which will allow some users to submit more reviews per day
based on their posting history.

In the end, all users get equal rewards for writing reviews. Rewards are being sent out
once every two weeks — the amount of reward tokens is being divided by the total number
of users being rewarded.

The remaining 10% are called Platform fees and go to the platform. Users receive a
reward only if a company approves their review.

Economical aspects

If a user believes the company should not have rejected their review, they can file a
dispute. In this case, the dispute will be handle by a decentralized system of “oracles”. Or-
acles are users with high reputations within the platform. In case the user was able to pres-
ent proof, they receive a reward, and the company receives a warning is penalized for 10
x RF. A company may receive a total of three warnings, the fourth will lead to the company
being blocked from using the platform.

A user can also receive a warning. This can happen in two cases. The first case is if
three of the user's reviews in a two-week period get rejected by the automatic filtration
system. The second is if five of the user's reviews have been rejected by companies in a
two-week period. The fourth warning leads to the user being blocked from using the plat-
form without being able to withdraw their funds.

Technical side

This section explains the functioning of the Revain platform from a technical stand-
point. The mechanism for double filtration of reviews is described in detail along with the
tool for automatic filtration that uses the IBM Watson Al and the manual review filtration

mechanism, as well as possible course of events.

In the last paragraph, we explain our method of storing reviews in the blockchain,
which guarantees the impossibility of editing or deleting them and the overall transparen-
cy of the system.

Review filtration

A review filtration mechanism was vital for our platform. The biggest difference be-
tween our filtration method from the methods implemented by other review sites is that
the verification process does not require the involvement of a third party. It consists of two
stages - machine moderation performed by the Al, and manual moderation done by the
company. This method guarantees that Revain employees do not get involved in the
moderation process.

Review Automatic Filtering (RAF)
After submission, each review first has to go through automatic moderation. This
system is based on machine learning and neural networks. Similar systems are already im-

plemented by several big companies, such as Instagram®, Yandex.Market’ and VK®.

We cannot disclose the process in detail for security reasons. We only reveal it par-
tially in order to prevent malicious users from bypassing our filters.

Tone Analyzer & Natural Language Understanding

A key component of our system is the interaction with the IBM Watson platform.
Thanks to the Tone Analyzer service, we are able to automatically determine the emotion-
al component of reviews. For example, let's take an absolutely unconstructive comment:

WORST BLOCKCHAIN PROJECT EVER! Be careful and never invest in pro-
Jects like this one! I've lost 70% of my investments because this company did
not even tried to develop fine product!!!

Such a bullsh*t!!!11 Guys, your product is totally useless and | don't believe
that you've spent 5 million dollars on it! More likely you've bought cars and
yachts instead of spending this money on R&D. You're liars!! BTW All inter-
faces are totally craptastic, | don't know how can anyone use it?!

In this post Tone Analyzer will detect at least three factors indicating that this might
not be a quality review. We are talking about factors such as high Anger, Disgust and Sad-
ness levels. These parameters don't reach a similar level in constructive reviews, and this
particular review would be marked as unconstructive before even reaching Manual mod-
eration.

Emotion Language Style Social Tendencies
< 5 = not likely present < .5 =not likely present < .5=not likely present
> .5 = likely present > .5 = likely present > 5 = likely present
> .75 = very likely present > .75 = very likely present > .75 = very likely present

Technical side

In addition to the Tone Analyzer tool, we employ a variety of filters developed by us.
They track the user’s geolocation, past activity (posting frequency, automatic & manual fil-
tration results for previous reviews), review characteristic and others. We also use the Nat-
ural Language Understanding? service. It is capable of deriving the essence of a review,
detecting semantic blocks, key words and word collocations, and check for their compli-
ance with the general essence of the text.

Manual filtration

Once the reviews have passed RAF successfully, it is reviewed by the company it is
targeted at. The company's moderators can either approve or reject the review. Regard-
less of their decision, the review will still be visible to all users.

Technical side

In case a company does not agree with a review and rejects it, it must write a com-
ment of their own in response to that review. This comment will be shown together with
the review, thus solving the issue with unconstructive reviews.

Review snapshots storage (RSS)

After a review has passed manual filtration, a part of its structure is saved in the
Ethereum blockchain. Thanks to this, users and the companies can be sure that the review
has not been edited. This type of data is stored by a smart contract called RSS - Review
Snapshots Storage. Its source code is given in the Appendix, Part C.

Technical side

As we have already mentioned, only a part of the review is stored in the Ethereum
blockchain. The reason for this is that storing large amounts of data in the Ethereum
blockchain is not economically feasible. We have tested more than ten different block-
chain systems, including Bitcoin*®, Emercoin™, Storj and SiaCoin*. We have reached the
conclusion that a decentralized platform for storing information, capable of holding the
large amounts of data we intend to have, has not been developed to date.

Therefore, we have decided to sacrifice the integrity of the review’s structure in favor
of true decentralization. For this, we have created the “Review Snapshot" based on the
below formula:

Review checksum = sha256(Review full text) [0:20]
Review snapshot = Rating + Company decision + Unix timestamp + Review check-
sum

Reviews then will be stored in the RSS, and the unique identifiers of the user and the
company will be used as keywords for searching. Any user can check a contract to see if
a review has been tampered with.

Reviews[company_id][user_id] = review snapshot

Possible issues

Qo Companies purchasing reviews

This type of behavior is not economically feasible in our system, since the review
fee will grow continuously.

9 Users attempting to earn rewards by posting made up reviews
Companies have the right to reject reviews that it deems untrue, so such users

will only lose tokens. Since the reviews are made up, the user would not be able to provide
any proof of the opposite.

Technical side

9 No guarantee that reviews are not being edited

Reviews on our platform are saved in the Ethereum blockchain. Anyone can
compare any review with what have been saved in the smart contract.

9 Companies rejecting all critical reviews

Since all reviews and the company’s rejection or approval of them are visible to
everyone on the system, companies with very high rejection rates will raise suspicion.

9 Lack of motivation for users

Users leaving quality reviews will be rewarded with RVN tokens that can then be
converted to R tokens, which can be traded on exchanges.

Crowdfunding

The Revain crowdfunding and the corresponding process of token generation are
handled by smart contracts which are based on Ethereum. Users, who wish to support the
project's development can do this by sending cryptocurrencies or tokens from other pro-
jects to our wallets.

The funds must be sent after the beginning of the crowdfunding process. We plan
to start around 21st August, and the whole process will last for approximately two weeks.
We will accept the following cryptocurrencies:

bitcoin ethereum NAVCOIN
- @ € LV) )
Bitcoin Cash " CASH vertcoin DOGECOIN

The crowdfunding process

During the crowdfunding R tokens will be available for purchase for a fixed price. The
total amount of R tokens issued will be 1,000,000,000 tokens, 70% of which will be availa-
ble during crowdfunding. We plan to acquire 8,000 BTC. The cost of 1 token is calculated
according to the formula:

. 8 000 BTC
Token price = ——————————— = 0, 000011 BTC per R token
700 000 000 R token

Of the remaining 30%, 20% will be divided between the members of the Revain
team and used to support the functioning of the platform. The remaining 10% will be
given to advisors and the members of our big bounty program.

R tokens are based on the Ethereum platform and the standard token interface
ERC20. The source code of the token can be found in Appendix A.

Despite the fact that we suggest using the token with our software, ERC20 lets any
investor work with the token using any Ethereum client (for example - Mist or MyEther-
Wallet). This way our investors can minimize the risk of losing funds in the event that our
software malfunctions.

Crowdfunding

Goals

As mentioned above, the goal of the crowdfunding is securing funds for R&D and cov-
ering platform-related costs. The following list shows how we plan to divide the funds.

Future work

As per July 2017, Revain is undergoing alpha testing. The main mechanics for inter-
action between users and the platform are already in place, as well as the mechanism for
platform-blockchain interaction on the level of RVN tokens. We are planning to announce
public alpha in the beginning of September 2017.

In addition to the main user interface, we have developed an HTML widget that
companies can install on their websites. Thanks to this widget visitors to the company’s site
will be able to see reviews from our platform.

Later, after we have made sure the platform is operating smoothly, we plan to
expand to new markets. Firstly, we are interested in gaming, e-commerce, booking, and
FMCG. Our data suggests these four directions will be the most profitable for us.

General

Conclusion

This paper describes the realization of a review aggrega-
tion system for projects that have passed their ICO. We believe
that our platform can meet two basic needs of our clients - the
possibility to affect the development of a product, and sharing
their experience with others.

Thanks to its module architecture and versatility, the
system can be rebuilt to accommodate reviews from other
fields. In light of all of the above, we believe that Revain has the
chance to become a groundbreaking project on the review
website market.

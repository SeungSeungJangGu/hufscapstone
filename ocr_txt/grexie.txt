KEY HIGHLIGHTS

Grexie is a new ERC20 crypto token offered for free on the Polygon
blockchain, users just need to pay the negligible Polygon gas price
to receive decreasing allocations of up to 1 million GREX.

The total supply for the token is 1 quadrillion GREX (1x101.)

60% of the supply is allocated to a long-running Initial Coin
Offering, available through our website at https://grexie.com

40% of the supply is allocated to the team and its philanthropic
causes, as well as team-led liquidity pools, exchange fees, and
airdrops.

The amount of GREX allocated per issue in the Community
Distribution halves roughly every 350 million issues. If interest
steadily grows, and while there are no guarantees, this should
double the value of the token roughly every 350 million issues. This
is because the gas price paid for an allocation remains the same,
while the amount allocated halves.

There is enough currency for around 12 billion issues of tokens,
with 1 GREX allocated per issue after around 8 billion issues of the
token.

Available on QuickSwap to purchase in bulk at market-led prices.

INTRODUCTION

There are a multitude of crypto tokens out there, some of them
with several properties and use cases, fulfilling needs of the
communities that invest in them and providing value in
different ways.

Crypto tokens generally go through an Initial Coin Offering - to
seek a community to invest in that token for a promise of
greater value in the future.

Many ICOs have hyper inflated token valuations and dubious
benefits to the community that they propose to serve.

What if we were to have a simple exchange token that is purely
market-led and offered initially for free to anyone willing to
pay the negligible gas fee?

Grexie (GREX) offers this. A free token for all, ina long running
free Community Distribution, which is deflationary and allows
everyone to get a tranche of the crypto token.

Free it is, and initially valueless it is too, but why would anyone
want to sell for less than the gas price they paid for it? That is
the power of the deflationary long-running Community
Distribution - a mechanism that gently influences the market
value over time.

WHY OFFER A FREE TOKEN

We've founded Grexie on two simple but important principals:
the value of cryptocurrency; and the importance of speed of
adoption within an ever-expanding market.

Firstly, we believe that crypto tokens are the future of the world
economy and should be accessible to everyone, but right now
they haven't reached their full potential.

If crypto is to truly reach it’s potential, we need to find a way to
distribute a secure coin to a huge population, and to do so
before the waters become so muddled with scams and rug-
pulls that the market loses confidence in the general product.

This is why we've created Grexie. We are offering a free coin
with no intrinsic value open to anyone and everyone. We
believe that over time, if enough people flock to Grexie, there is
no reason why it shouldn't be a useful currency for online
transactions. However, we are determined that this should be
the result of market forces and not some invented ICO stage
valuation, hence why we are making the commitment to
provide the limited supply of 600 trillion GREX open to the
market for free, for over 12 billion allocations.

OUR BACKGROUND

Grexie is the brain-child of Tim Behrsin. Tim has over 20 years
experience in technology, serving many startups and big-name
organizations. He has a strong background in full-stack
JavaScript and software engineering in general. His interest in
Ethereum was garnered in 2015 when it was launched: an
innovative platform to create smart verifiable contracts with a
secure blockchain environment.

His interest in Ethereum grew from there, and he has been
playing with Solidity smart-contracts for the last 6 years on
and off, until the idea struck him in 2021 to create his own
crypto token on the Ethereum proof-of-work blockchain.

Grexie started on Ethereum in June 2021 after creating an
ERC20 token and a smart contract for a deflationary
Community Distribution. It soon became clear that gas prices
were too high for widespread adoption, and he moved the
project to Polygon’s proof-of-stake blockchain network in
August 2021.

Since then, the project has started to gain traction, with over
200 organic allocations and over 1.5 million courtesy
allocations distributed to people's wallets.

WHY POLYGON

We believe the Ethereum blockchain will emerge as the front-
runner in crypto due to its versatility in creating and running
smart contracts.

Ethereum, as a classical proof-of-work blockchain, has some
pitfalls that mean operating a free crypto token on it, we
believe, will not lead to wide adoption across the world’s
population. As an example of this, gas prices in August 2021 for
ERC20 smart contract transfers were very high, and the price
for one allocation of GREX would have been exorbitant.

As a result, we have launched on the layer-2 protocol Polygon,
which operates a_ proof-of-stake algorithm to verify
transactions. This results in much lower gas fees.

Polygon was designed to interoperate with Ethereum and
offers bridging contracts on the Ethereum blockchain to
convert WETH to ETH, WMATIC to MATIC, and back again.

This means that whatever value Grexie attains on the Polygon
network, can be traded by proxy to tokens and currencies on
the Ethereum network, and vice versa.

We believe Polygon is the right choice for Grexie.

TOKENOMICS

There is no special use case for GREX other than to use it as an
exchange token. One day it might be possible to withdraw and
deposit fiat-currencies at ATMs connected to your Polygon
wallet, connecting GREX to the wider monetary ecosystem,
however this is not our aim.

Our aim is simple: to offer an exchange token for free.

The total supply of GREX is 1 quadrillion tokens (1x10.) 40%
of tokens, 400 trillion GREX, is allocated to the team, liquidity
pools on decentralized exchanges, fees for exchanges and
airdrops. Fiat for liquidity pools is funded by Grexie, and we
aim to offer around 1 trillion GREX on QuickSwap by Jan 2022.
60% of the tokens, 600 trillion GREX, is allocated to Community
Distribution, with any remaining quantity once the pool is
exhausted being allocated to Grexie.

The Community Distribution pool will have some residual
tokens remaining in it once it is exhausted, as not all
transactions will have an affiliate associated with them.

To understand the mechanism by which we offer tokens for
free, and the tokenomics behind it, it is helpful to have a bit of a
refresher of high school mathematics.

// 7 TOKENOMICS
A geometric series is a series of the form:
at+artar*t+ar?t..

For r < 1, a property of a geometric series is that it converges
to a finite sum. For example, for a@=1 and r = 1/, the series
converges fo 2.

We are giving away tokens with each issue being an element in
a geometric series. This leads to a total allocation being a fixed
quantity, a finite quantity, and a quantity planned for in
advance... and is a limited supply that cannot grow. The fact
that it is fixed and finite is important, as we cannot increase the
supply to suit our whim. The quantity is fixed, forever, and
everyone knows it when they are making investment decisions
about the token.

Each allocation is of the form:

_— n-1
«()
Y

where a is 1 million GREX, y is the total Community Distribution

pool available of 600 trillion GREX, and n is the issue number,
starting from 1 as the 15 issue.

https://grexie.com + @grexie « hello@grexie.com is g rex | =

Grexie Whitepaper v1 - 21 September 2021
//8 TOKENOMICS

Each allocation might also supply 10% extra GREX per issue to
social media affiliates through affiliate links, and so the total
pool available is 600 + 1.1 = 545. 45 trillion GREX.

Since the Ethereum blockchain is based on _ fixed-point
arithmetic, this doesn’t lead to an infinite series, and tends toa
limit of 600 trillion GREX after around 12 billion allocations.

In the smart contract, for which you can view the Solidity code
on polygonscan.com, we calculate the dividend and the divisor
to the lower half of the above formula iteratively, so we don't
reach an integer overflow in the smart contract and error out.

Due to each allocation being part of a geometric series, the
value of GREX received in each allocation decreases in an
exponential fashion.

The allocations halve roughly every 350 million issues. Leading
to 1 GREX being allocated per issue after about 8 billion issues.

Since the gas price for each issue will remain roughly the same,
the value per GREX, solely based on the gas price, roughly
doubles every 350 million issues. This assumes, of course, that
people don't sell GREX for less than they paid the gas price,
and it doesn't account for inflation/deflation in value on open
markets. It should not be used as a basis for investment.

Grexie Whitepaper v1 - 21 September 2021
//9 TOKENOMICS

With Polygon gas prices for the Community Distribution smart
contract currently being between $0.0001 to $0.003 this leads
to a potential value per issue at the start of the Community
Distribution increasing to the region of between $800 to
$23,000, depending on gas prices, after 8 billion issues.

This is purely a trajectory, and not guaranteed, and no
investment advice should be understood or gained from these
statements. It is simply mathematics, and there are several
factors which could otherwise inflate or deflate this market
value of GREX, including but not limited to the price of Polygon
and people's perception of GREX on the open markets.

HOW WE INTEND TO USE PROFITS

The founders are philanthropic Christians at heart. We have
seen the struggle homeless people face, firstly in getting
housed in safe, secure and comfortable housing, and then to
build lives on benefits or low incomes.

We have in the past gone on sandwich runs and donated large
sums of money to homeless people on the streets in order to
secure nightly accommodation in shelters, or to buy furniture
and appliances for their first house on benefits after being
homeless. We have also donated money for emergency rental
accommodation to avoid being homeless in the first place.

We need capital in order to support this work going forward,
and part of the money we raise from the cryptocurrency will be
used for the purpose of providing social housing and
rehabilitation projects across the world for homeless and low-
income renters.

Ultimately, we love God very much, and don’t want to see His
people suffer on the streets anymore. We want to give what
God gives us to His servants on the streets and those struggling
on benefits. To give them the chance fo live the lives they want
to live. Go check out Hebrews 13:3 if you want to know more.

THE INITIAL COIN OFFERING

People interested in receiving GREX can do so by going to
https://grexie.com and connecting their wallet using
MetaMask or any other Web3 wallet provider.

They can receive up to 1 million GREX per allocation,
decreasing for each allocation, and deposit this into their
Polygon wallet.

Each allocation costs the user a small gas fee of between
$0.0001 and $0.003 which is non-refundable and goes straight
to the verifier nodes on the Polygon network. The GREX is
therefore offered for free, no Polygon is exchanged with the
smart contract, it is solely a gas fee the user must pay.

There is always a danger of scams and threats to the Grexie
project, and it is more than likely that scam tokens will pop up
over time. So, be sure to use the following addresses for
interacting with the Grexie Token and the Grexie Community
Distribution smart contracts:

LIQUIDITY ON QUICKSWAP

The previous page shows a potential valuation based on gas
prices. This is highly unlikely at the higher end. Instead, the real
valuation of the crypto token comes from the market, and it is
important to speak of our WMATIC/GREX position on
QuickSwap.

We have created a liquidity pool of around 200 billion GREX on
QuickSwap. We aim to increase this to about 1 trillion GREX by
the end of January 2022.

You can get to the swap page for the WMATIC/GREX pair
using this link: https://bit.ly/grexie-quickswap

We encourage users to stake WMATIC and GREX and extend
this liquidity pool to help encourage growth of the crypto
token. Users who create a liquidity pool get a proportional
0.25% fee for transactions on QuickSwap relative to your
position in the pool. You can add your own liquidity pool using
this link: https://bit.ly/grexie-quickswap-pool

We will extend our coverage to other exchanges as we can over
the coming months, connect with us on Telegram and Twitter to
be informed of updates to this.

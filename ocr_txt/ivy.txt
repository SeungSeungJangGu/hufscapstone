implemented, token holders may have the ability to
voluntarily de-anonymise transaction data to the satisfaction
of financial institutions in order to facilitate transactions
using cryptocurrency with the security and reliability of the
blockchain.

lvy White Paper v1.5 June 2018
Introduction

Ivy is a blockchain based technology for FIAT & Cryptocurrency business transactions which require
verification in the international monetary system. The Ivy Network utilizes IVY tokens which will carry
Know your Customer (KYC) and Know Your Transaction (KYT) to meet the verification requirements for

transactions.

Ina truly global financial market place, there is a very real
need for fast & secure transactions that meet KYC & BSA/
AML requirements for not just traditional FIAT currency, but
also cryptocurrencies as well.

Ivy bridges the gap between the centralized traditional
banking & payment systems and the decentralized
blockchain network to leverage the best of both worlds —
fast, decentralized processing that meets the regulatory
requirements of Financial Institutions around the world.

June 2018 Ivy White Paper v1.5

For an individual and/or business Ivy presents the
opportunity to make payments in cryptocurrencies to third
parties and for the third party to receive cash.

To the banks Ivy opens new channels of deposits that will
ultimately provide more revenue for financial institutions,
reduce fraud losses and provide for significant automation
of existing manual processes leading to substantial cost
savings.

Ivy bridges the gap between the
centralized traditional banking

& payment systems and the
decentralized blockchain network to
leverage the best of both worlds...
Problem:

There is an increased scrutiny from regulators surrounding any potential
transactions being linked to the proceeds of fraudulent of money laundering
activities. Through embedding KYC and KYT data points into a transaction
itself, Ivy's blockchain technology will provide regulatory comfort and access
to large pools of global funds that would otherwise be unbankable.

Ivy solution:

Ivy provides financial institution grade technology that can be easily
implemented globally.

i. Ivy's technology will provide Know Your Transaction iii. Immutable records in the blockchain for audits by
(KYT) information that greatly exceeds regulatory Financial Institutions, Compliance Departments, Bank
requirements as will be hashed into the blockchain and Auditors and Potentially Regulators

An electronic funds transfer is a transaction in which money moves from one financial institution to another (or from
one account to another) at the instruction of a financial institution's customer. Financial institutions facilitate this
through the communication of electronic messages that form the basis for making the required bookkeeping entries
and making funds available. Electronic funds transfers are the primary mechanism used by businesses for the transfer
of money between two parties.

Financial institutions facilitate electronic funds transfers through the sending and receiving of electronic messages
per understood and well-supported standards, including SWIFT and ISO 20022. The messages sent between financial
institutions direct the sending bank to debit the sender's account and the receiving bank to credit the recipient's
account.

The entities involved in a transfer include:
+ Originator (such as a business or individual) - the initiator of the transfer;
+ Beneficiary - the party who is the end recipient of the transfer;

+ — Originator’s financial institution - the financial institution that receives the originator’s transfer instructions and
transmits the fund's to the beneficiary's financial institution;

+ Beneficiary’s financial institution - the financial institution that receives the funds and holds the account to be
credited; and

Additional/Intermediary Financial Institutions - other institutions that may be required to execute the transaction.

Ivy White Paper v1.5 June 2018
Frequently used payment formats include:

SWIFT The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications ("SWIFT") is a member-owned messaging
network used for funds transfer instructions using standardized codes.
SWIFT is a communication network that a financial institution in one country can use to communicate with its
branches or other financial institutions in a different country. SWIFT is a messaging system for funds transfer
instructions, rather than a financial settlement system.
Most international interbank messages use the SWIFT network. SWIFT divides its messages into a series
of formats, known as message types. Each message type represents a type of transaction or message. The
message types are separated into ten categories: (MTOxx — System Messages; MT1xx — Customer Payments
and Checks; MT2xx — Financial Institution Transfers; MT3xx — Treasury Markets; MT4xx — Collection and
Cash Letters; MT5xx — Securities Markets; MT6xx — Treasury Markets — Metals and Syndications; MT7xx
— Documentary Credits and Guarantees; MT8xx — Travelers Checks; and MT9xx — Cash Management and
Customer Status).
On average, SWIFT records 28.4 million FIN messages per day*. SWIFT directs the transfer of nearly $5 trillion
worldwide each day, or $1.25 quadrillion per year®.

CHIPS The Clearing House Interbank Payments System ("CHIPS') is a funds-transfer system that transmits and settles
payment orders in US dollars for some of the largest and most active banks in the world.

On an average day, CHIPS transmits and settles more than 446,000 “payment messages" worth $155 trillion. It
operates 20 hours a day and matches transactions between banks in real time’.

The Fedwire Funds Service ("Fedwire’) is a real-time, gross settlement system jointly owned by the 12 US
Federal Reserve Banks®. Both senders and recipients must hold accounts with Fedwire-participating financial
institutions, and the transfers are same-day, non-revocable payments. Though participating institutions are all
US-based institutions, Fedwire can be used as the US-based portion of international transfers.

In 2016, Fedwire transfers averaged a daily volume of 590,209 transactions, representing $3.05 trillion’.
The Fedwire service operates beginning 9:00 PM the night before a business day until 6:00 PM Eastern Time
(GMT - 5).

ACH The Automated Clearing House ("ACH") is an electronic payment network run by the National Automated
Clearing House Association ("NACHA’), a non-profit membership association supported by 10,000+ financial
institutions. ACH transfers include direct deposits, payroll payments, and consumer payments (e.g. to insurance
and mortgage companies).

ACH direct debit transfers include consumer payments on insurance premiums, mortgage loans, and other
kinds of bills. ACH covers the United States. The European equivalent is SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) and
the UK has three equivalent systems: BACS, CHAPS, and Faster Payments.

The ACH Network moves $43 trillion and 25 billion electronic financial transactions each year'®.

Financial institutions use various payment formats depending on the nature of transactions. In some instances, multiple payment
methods may be used for a single transaction.

June 2018 Ivy White Paper v1.5
3) Information Within the Incumbent Funds Transfer Process

Transactions between two parties are typically referred to in the financial industry as third-party payments. That is, transactions
processed by financial institutions on behalf of parties — individuals or entities — that are not themselves financial institutions.
With some notable exceptions, these transactions generally can be divided into two main types:

+ Transactions processed pursuant to documents to which the financial institutions are privy, such as in the case of trade
finance, where one or more financial institutions will have access to a letter of credit, a guarantee, and/or some other
information such as bills of lading and other shipping information.

+ Transactions processed without financial institutions having such documents. These transactions are often referred to as
“clean payments". The significant majority of third party payments processed are of this type, where the financial institutions
processing the payments have relatively little visibility into the nature of the underlying transaction. In the trade finance
space, such transactions are referred to as “open account trade’.

Information that might be included with financial transactions fall into two categories:

+ Know Your Customer (KYC): KYC information typically includes identifying information such as the customer's name,
address, account number, and so on.

+ — Know Your Transaction (KYT): KYT information includes details such as the type of transaction (for example, whether the
transaction involves cash, foreign wire payments, or cheques), the recipient of the funds (including its address as reported by
the sender at the time of instruction), and details included in the transaction memo.

4) Industry Regulation and the Relevance of Ivy

Over the past 50 years, funds transfers have become increasingly electronic. With this advancement, and the accompanying
growth in transaction volumes, financial institutions, law enforcement, and regulatory agencies are confronted with increasingly
numerous and complex challenges for combatting financial crime. Jurisdictions throughout the world continue to strengthen
anti money-laundering (AML) laws. Because nearly all countries have adopted — and commit increasing resources to the
enforcement of — these types of laws, consumers and businesses are accustomed to financial institutions requesting KYC
information to verify the identity of a customer when a new financial account is opened, or when a large funds transfer is made.

a. Anti-Money Laundering at Financial Institutions

Taking the United States as an example, the Bank Secrecy Act"! and other requirements call for financial institutions to
implement and adhere to policies, procedures and controls sufficient to provide for the detection, investigation, and reporting of
suspicious activity. This includes transactions that could signify money laundering, tax evasion or other criminal activities. Similar
requirements are commonplace in developed economies around the world.

Methods used to detect suspicious activity typically involve rules-based automated suspicious activity monitoring platforms
that review, on a batch-processed basis, recent customer activity. These rules or scenarios flag specific transactions, or groups
of transactions, for further analysis. This analysis typically involves a manual review by financial institution personnel to either
eliminate the flagged activity as “not suspicious,’ or to escalate the activity for further review and, potentially, onward for
reporting to law enforcement.

Additionally, certain higher-risk customers are often subject to periodic ongoing due diligence reviews that involve an in-

depth analysis of the transactions conducted by the customer over a period of, for example, the most recent six or 12 months.
These due diligence reviews have a similar purpose to the automated transaction monitoring detection methods, which is to
understand the nature of the underlying activity so that the financial institution can make decisions regarding the risks and
acceptability of retaining the customer relationship, apply appropriate controls to the account(s) of identified parties, and report
suspicious activity, as required.

Regulatory expectation in this area is that financial institutions undertake enough due diligence and analysis to gain comfort
that customer activity is not suspicious, otherwise the activity should be further analyzed and reported to law enforcement.
Financial institutions are expected to perform these assessments on the basis of all available information; where additional
information would assist, financial institutions are expected to collect it, but to do so ina manner that does not “tip off” anyone —
including the customer or related party — that an investigation has been, or may be, in progress.

11. https://www.occ.treas.gov/topics/compliance-bsa/bsa/index-bsa.html

lvy White Paper v1.5 June 2018
b. Ramifications of Anti-Money Laundering Laws

Compliance with AML laws requires that banks have sufficient information to implement, execute, and support their anomaly
detection programs. Cryptocurrency and its inherent anonymity put banks in a bind, since such transactions do not naturally
come with the information banks need to carry out the practices they need to identify fraudulent or illegal activity. To protect
themselves, banks commonly suspend accounts that contain fiat deposits originating from cryptocurrency-related transactions,
and refuse to accept gains or settlement in cryptocurrency as a legitimate medium of exchange. One implication of this decision
is that legitimate businesses are unable to perform transactions involving cryptocurrencies because they are unable to bank the
proceeds.

c. The Benefits of More Information

There are clear benefits from having additional information readily available, either while investigating an automated transaction
monitoring system's alert, or during an activity review as part of ongoing due diligence. The additional information can help

the investigator or reviewer more effectively and efficiently determine whether the nature of the activity, including the parties
involved, gives rise to any doubt as to its appropriateness or legality.

This additional information can help the financial institution determine whether a customer needs to be categorized as high risk
or if the institution is breaching its obligations under AML laws. In the case of routine benign activity, this information can allow a
bank to more effectively focus investigative resources on other customers and their heightened risk activity.

Although traditional payment methods typically embed limited information, this additional data is generally readily available,
either within the financial institution's KYC records about the instructing customer, or provided directly by the customer in
transaction instructions.

Information of the former type could include, for example, a description of the nature of the customer's business, their
geographic focus, expected activity that the account(s) are likely to experience, and information regarding related parties to the
account, such as beneficial owners and signatories. The transaction itself (KYT) could include information related to supporting
documentation such as invoices, credit notes, shipping documentation, and information identifying the parties to a transaction
(these may include more parties than the originator and beneficiary parties, such as shipping companies). It can also include
documentation, or evidence of such documentation, that would show the legal permissibility of transactions, such as licences
issued by US. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control or the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security.

Embedding such information into the payment instruction mechanism, as an aspect of the supporting protocol, could prove
crucial to help a financial institution's reviewer form a more comprehensive and clear picture regarding the nature of the
underlying activity. By making KYC and KYT information more readily available and eliminating knowledge gaps, the financial
institution can focus its attention on investigating other instances that deserve heightened scrutiny. Unfortunately, a number of
protocol developments in financial technology focus heavily on interoperability and speed, considering regulatory compliance
as an overlay of inconvenience that can be addressed at later points following deployment, meaning that the promise of a
comprehensive solution is seldom realized.

June 2018 Ivy White Paper v1.5
The benefits of cryptocurrency vs incumbent financial systems are well understood:

However, the inherent anonymity of most current
cryptocurrencies creates incompatibility with the current
financial system.

The lvy Network will enable KYC, KYT, and AML data
supporting transactions to be captured using a blockchain-
based cryptocurrency. It will be optimally designed for
transactions with financial institutions, embedding far more
compliance and transaction audit information than incumbent
payment networks. Transaction data will be made available to
satisfy the stringent requirements of financial institutions and
intermediaries. When implemented, the Ivy Network will have

distinct advantages over incumbent financial systems and
competing cryptocurrencies.

Ivy seeks to bridge the gap between current global financial
systems and the emergence of cryptocurrencies, positioning
itself as the future for global payments.

When fully developed, the primary differences between the
Ivy Network and traditional payment networks will be that
the lvy Network:

* will securely facilitate the transfer of cryptocurrency
payments while associating KYC and KYT data via the
trusted, distributed Ivy network;

ill securely store an immutable reference to supporting

nsaction data in a public blockchain;

ill embed more KYT information into the transfer than

ditional payment methods;

ill embed more KYC information into the transfer than

ditional payment methods;

ill be able to be integrated into existing banking software;

ill offer easy integration into accounting software for
okkeeping efficiency; and

ill provide revocable access to KYC/KYT data to
financial institutions, accountants, company managers
and others, depending on the information they require.

In regards to KYC and KYT, frequently used incumbent payment formats typically support collecting relatively few data points.

Note: The Company is not affiliated with SWIFT, CHIPS, ACH or Fedwire. All information is provided on a general basis and is based on the
available information at the time of the Company's research.

When implemented, the lvy Network will be far more descriptive than the existing systems and processes. Depending on the
type of financial transaction being performed, it is anticipated that the lvy Network will allow for the inclusion of more than 120
different KYT data points and more than 70 different KYC data points in transaction messages. A convenient way to categorize
these data points is according to the documentation source from which they might originate.

Ivy White Paper v1.5 June 2018
Specifically, with reference to Ripple, the lvy Network is intended to be a decentralized network of validators, consisting of
financial institutions and intermediaries, who use the Tokens for the purpose of communicating KYC/KYT/AML data and for
settling balances on the network. Compliance and audit are first-principle concerns in the lvy Network. Transactions with Tokens
will be initiated against a contract listed on the public Ethereum network using Tokens that are easily traded for their utility of
facilitating payments to recipients of payment remittance in fiat currency at their financial institutions. This differs greatly from
the use of XRP, the core Ripple currency, which has little public use aside from as a medium of exchange.

The market potential is well recognised. Ripple is one of the largest’? cryptocurrencies behind bitcoin.

In addition to the base features described above, the
Company plans, in due course, to incorporate the following
features, functionalities, and solutions into the lvy Network:

b. Peer-to-Peer Cryptocurrency to Fiat Currency
Network

Whereas the initial uses for the lvy Network is to provide for

predominantly business-to-business transactions, strong

demand also exists for a simplified payment network that

allows individuals to easily send, receive and manage their

cryptocurrencies and easily convert them to fiat currency.

c. Software Integration

The Company will seek to integrate with existing bank
software so that KYT and KYC can be distributed
automatically to the correct locations within the respective
bank system.

The Company also intends to integrate with major
accounting software systems. The easy integration of
payments and receipts from customers, including invoice
details, will enable transactional data to be loaded directly
into the accounting software, reducing the customer's
administrative load.

d. Cashier and Conversion Services

The Company intends to develop cashier services and

conversion services. Cashier services facilitate:

* The withdrawal of fiat money from bank accounts and its
conversion into cryptocurrency; and
The conversion of cryptocurrencies back into fiat money
and their deposit into bank accounts.

Exchange services will allow customers to convert Tokens to and from a range of other cryptocurrencies.

By providing both cashier and exchange services, the Company intends for the Ivy Network to be an end-to-end solution,
particularly for businesses making large transfers. The Company will seek to:

+ Facilitate the conversion of fiat money into cryptocurrency;
+ Facilitate the transfer of cryptocurrency across the globe; and

+ Enable the recipient to exchange the cryptocurrency back into fiat money in their bank account.

Most importantly, it is intended that the Ivy Network will be able to do this without causing a problem with either the sending or
receiving financial institution.

e. Fixed Price Transfers via Open Market Operations

Potential currency loss during the process of cryptocurrency transfers is one of the biggest inhibitors to mainstream adoption
of cryptocurrencies by merchants. The Company aims to develop a fixed price solution to remove currency loss due to
cryptocurrency price volatility.

The fixed price solution involves using a pool of treasury coins to be used specifically for USD fiat to USD fiat transactions
involving two bank accounts. Fiat will be pulled from the senders bank account using an ODFI (“Originating Deposit Taking
Financial Institution). The lvy Network will then facilitate the conversion of the fiat into Tokens using a treasury of off-market
tokens designed specifically for this purpose (see section 7).

2) Financial Institutions
With increased financial institution support, the lvy Network has the potential to be used for the following transactions, plus
many more:

+ Domestic or international purchases of goods;

* Business to business services;

* General transfer of value which is destined to be fiat in a financial institution;
+ — Software licence purchases;

+ Real estate purchases;

+ Global investing;

+ Large personal transfers; and

+ Small personal transfers.

3) User Functionality

It is proposed that, the lvy Network will provide a value exchange between counterparties where (1) a sending party seeks to
send large sums of cryptocurrency to a receiving party and (2) the receiving party receives that cryptocurrency balance to a
bank account in fiat currency.

Both senders and receivers will be able to use Tokens to move cryptocurrency into financial institutions via the lvy Network,
which will be available for purchase at ivykoin.com and publicly on major exchanges. Account holders wishing to move other
cryptocurrencies through the Ivy Network must trade third party cryptocurrencies into Tokens first.

ivykoin.com will be accessible by users via phone or mobile device and from a sender's perspective will provide the following
core functionality:

+ Account setup and management;

+ Transaction management; and

+ Token purchase, sale and transfer.

lvy White Paper v1.5 June 2018
a. Account Setup and Management

It is anticipated that senders and recipients will be able to create Ivy Network accounts at ivykoin.com and, after the registration
process, receive unique sender identification information. The lvy Network will save all of the sender's account information so
that they do not have to provide the same information for subsequent transfers. This KYC information consists of a variety of
data fields and files that represent the identity of the user, such as name, email, phone, address, and government identification.

When fully developed, accounts will be able to be managed through an online dashboard at ivykoin.com, including updating KYC
and recurring transactional data. Account holders may request to connect to other Ivy Network account holders and populate

a roster of known and verified cryptocurrency payment peers, which is helpful when sending frequently to the same recipients,
or to quickly and efficiently send to new recipients. Account holders may make themselves visible on the lvy Network globally
and requests may be made by one account holder to add another to their own roster. They may also use Ivy Network services to
convert and send Tokens to their own fiat accounts at financial institutions.

i. Sender Data Verification
The Ivy Network intends to verify basic sender data and legitimacy of bank accounts as part of the account opening
process. The lvy Network will provide initial identity document verification using various third-party services. Identity
documents such as passports and drivers licenses are intended to be validated within minutes. If documents are not
recognised, then the account will be placed into pending status for further investigation. Similarly, business licenses and
other registered corporate documents will be able to be quickly verified.

Toward the same end, account holders’ bank account information is intended to be verified using a process whereby
small deposits are placed into account holders’ bank accounts, and those deposit amounts are used to independently
verify the successful connection between the Ivy Network and the bank account.

Despite these efforts, the Company does not guarantee responsibility for the legitimacy or illegitimacy of payments,
though this practice is very similar to that taken by incumbent networks.

a. Transaction Management
Once an Ivy Network accounts is established, it is anticipated that a sender will be able to initiate a transfer of Tokens toa
recipient. The sender will enter the specific transaction information into the account in advance of the transaction. The Ivy
Network will request base level information for all transfers, however the required additional detail varies based on the laws and
regulations that are applicable. The lvy Network will prompt a sender to provide additional specifics related to their transaction.
For example, if a sender is making a payment in exchange for goods, the information the Ivy Network embeds into the transfer
might include country of origin, final destination, proof of import duties paid or other identifying information. A sender may also
choose to provide additional details about the transfer — for example, a copy of the invoice with the payment. Furthermore, if a
sender knows that they aren't a trusted source by the recipient, they can include information such quality assurance certificates,
batch information, articles of incorporation, and other voluntary KYT information which is extensive.

b. Ivy Purchase, Sell and Transfer

It is anticipated that the lvy Network will facilitate the secure transmission of funds and data for the benefit of both a sender and
a financial institution. When a bank is reviewing transactions for suspicious activity, it will have significantly more data points to
assist in the review, as compared to legacy payment networks and more modern alternatives for payment transfers.

Payment values will be viewable by the public in the blockchain and cannot be deleted. KYT and KYC data will be encrypted and
bound to Tokens sent by a sender to the Ivy Network, and are subsequently accessible to the receiving institution and receiver.
This KYC/KYT/AML data can only be viewed by parties associated with the transaction.

The diagrams below depict the anticipated flow of Tokens from the perspectives of a sender, receiver and financial institution.
The user interface is simple and intuitive.

be captured in cryptographic containers that are generated
from the Ivy Public Network interaction with the lvy

Network smart contracts and support the activities of the
Ivy Private Network participants in facilitating transaction
settlement. This data will be stored and accessible by the
financial institution and governing regulators of the fiat

Smart Contract 2

lvy White Paper v1.5 June 2018
a. Public Network, ivySend, and Public Ivy Tokens (IVY)

Once the Ivy Network is operational, it is anticipated that public parties seeking to send third party cryptocurrency to the
account of an intended recipient must exchange their cryptocurrency for Tokens at a public exchange or purchase Tokens
directly from the Ivy Network. lvy Public Network Tokens (IVY) will be authored to the ERC20 specification, available on the
Ethereum network. Tokens will be submitted to an Ivy Network contract (ivySend Contract) on the Ethereum network, where
they are subsequently held in escrow. The escrow state completes on the basis of two conditions: a) the transfer is successfully
completed, in which case the Tokens are transferred to the lvy Network, where they are sold on secondary markets or on the
Company's website for either cash or third party cryptocurrency, or, alternatively burned; or, b) the transfer fails, in which case
the full amount of the Tokens submitted to the lvy Network is refunded.

An ivySend Contract is anticipated to be a smart contract that can be addressed by any number of parties interested in
calling it from the public Ethereum network. While in initial implementation, it is likely to be available through the interface of
ivykoin.com, through the website's direct integration with the Ethereum network. It is additionally envisioned that other parties
will similarly incorporate this contract as a payment interface. An ivySend Contract is intended to operate using Ethereum
network gas incentives, whereby the sender must cover the calling cost of the contract, allowing the contract's processing on
the Ethereum network to occur. Should gas submitted not prove sufficient for mining public incentives, the escrow contract
will never take effect to secure the sender's lvy Network account balance, such that it might continue with the rest of the
transaction. lvy Network fees are also incorporated into the cost of the ivySend Contract process (much like wire transfers
performed at traditional financial institutions).

It is anticipated that a party seeking to use the Ivy Network can use the Company's website to easily view a) common
cryptocurrency to Token exchange rates at a variety of common cryptocurrency exchanges; b) expected Ethereum gas charges
for successful execution of the ivySend Contract; and c) total gross Token fees (fiat balance desired + gas charges + commission)
for a given balance of fiat currency sought to be sent to an intended recipients account. As a number of these components are
volatile in overall pricing, by using the Company's website, it is intended that a user of an ivySend Contract can receive a price
quote for execution over a 10 minute period, which locks in the execution quote for a given ivySend Contract transaction of the
quoted parameters, within an upper and lower limit of volatility expressed by the Ivy Network, at the time the price quote is given.

In this way, when fully developed, IVY is anticipated to offer full utility functionality for its holders and protects them from volatility
in operating against the contract.

b. Private Network, ivyReceive, and Private Ivy Tokens (IVYB)
The Ivy Private Network is intended to distribute funds to the bank accounts of intended recipients by the use of private
ivyNetwork contracts (ivyReceive Contracts). The Ivy Private Network is proposed to operate using a private, permissioned

version of the Ethereum blockchain specialised coordination o

tokens that reflect Ivy Private Network account holders that have
. IVYB will be pre-mined by the Company, convertible to IVY by
proportion to their reserves in the lvy Network. In the case of the

Company's use of IVYB, the Company is intended to offer a pub

ic accounting of IVYB assets and liabilities to show that its dollar

deposits on the network are always equivalent to its token holdings, whether in escrow or reserve.

When message of a transaction pending arrives at the Ivy Private Network, an account holder must stake its IVYB for the
opportunity to receive the represented balance; meaning that the Ivy Private Network account holder must have a balance of
IVYB at least equal to the amount of the transaction. In this interaction, the process of staking the token provides the release of
the supporting KYC/KYT/AML information to the institution or intermediary, from which they are prompted to accept or decline
the funds (manually, or automatically, if pre-authorized). These Tokens are submitted to the ivyReceive Contract. The ivyReceive
Contract has two mandatory conditions for release of staked tokens:

a) Demonstration of Transaction Approval — Upon the review of applicable KYC/KYT/AML information, an agent of the
applicable financial institution sends either an approval or a denial response back to the ivyReceive Contract. Here, there

are two potential outcomes: a) the transaction goes through successfully, in which case the IVYB are returned and the IVYB

June 2018 Ivy White Paper v1.5
value on deposit by the lvy Private Network account holder at the financial institution for the intended recipient's account;
or, b) the transaction fails, in which case the IVYB are refunded to the financial institution; and

b) Demonstration of Cash Deposit — A monitor of the status of Ivy Private Network account holder's bank account provides the
mechanism by which demonstration of cash deposit by the financial institution into the recipient's account has occurred.
This status may require either custom integration for the purpose of observing the account state, or similar using account
access services from vendors such as Yodlee™?, Xignite"4, or Plaid"®. Either way, the business-to-business arrangement
between the Ivy Network and the financial institution will stipulate what the timing constraints for release of funds between
the accounts are.

If both the ‘demonstration of transaction approval’ and the ‘demonstration of cash deposit’ are shown as true, the party
staking IVYB on the Ivy Private Network is eligible to receive payment from the unlocked ivySend Contract on the Ivy Public
Network. If both conditions are false, or until they are otherwise set to true, the ivySend Contract on the Ivy Public Network
may be redeemed by the sender. Transaction approval may be withheld by a financial institution as it seeks to clear identified
compliance requirements through the use of KYC/KYT/AML data submitted with the lvy data container. Using metadata
associated with the transaction and container, it is possible to facilitate a degree of automated clearing on the basis of country
of origin, nature of goods exchanged in commerce, or other configurable rules as desired by the processing financial institution
or intermediary. Just the same, manual workflow may require that escrow be maintained for an extended period of time. The
default behaviour for submissions is for sender escrow to be determined by outcomes on the Ivy Private Network; however,

it is envisioned that delays with the bank KYC/KYT/AML process, and communication between sender and recipient may

also require some accommodation, whereby after a given period of delay, the sender may unwind the process by choosing to
retrieve a Token deposit from escrow.

It is intended that the ivyReceive Contract maintains an observable balance of all pending staked transactions. Permissions

on the Ivy Private Network provide isolation of the individual balances and workflow status of settlements pending at each

of the Recipients’ Financial Institutions and supporting Financial Intermediaries. In this way, the private token, when locked in

the ivyReceive Contract is intended to, a) provide visibility to the process of consideration by which the financial institution

or intermediary is considering the validity of the balance transmission; and, b) provide a throttle for the financial institution
operations, such that they may not stake a disproportionate amount of transactions without clearing them to satisfaction. Of
course, this also raises the question of what compels the financial institution or intermediary to make the deposit as required at
all. For this purpose, the lvy Network will be able to report the service levels of each of the financial institutions and intermediaries
on its network. Clearly, if a financial institution is not serving the needs of its clients, the clients should have the ability to consider
other options or opportunities from among the other participants on the lvy Network where transfer receipt is either more timely
or reliable.

¢. Interchain Communication and the Ivy Oracle Service
The Ivy Network is intended to serve as a functional intermediary between the Ivy Private Network and Ivy Public Network
detailed above, listening to and responding to events associated with the ivySend Contracts and ivyReceive Contracts.

It is anticipated that state changes in the ivySend Contract are observed by authorized Ivy validators participating on the public
Ethereum network. Similarly, state changes in the ivyReceive Contract are observed by Ivy Network validators participating on
the Ivy Private Network. Both of these validator sets will be able to inform the Ivy Oracle Service that provides attestation to the
state of each escrow contract and facilitates their respective functions.

Of specific interest is how value moves from the Ivy Public Network ledger balance to the Ivy Private Network ledger balance.
This is intended to involve a value transfer from IVY to IVYB, which occurs upon the approval message to the ivyReceive
Contract and demonstration of posted balance to a recipient's bank account. At the point when these two events occur, the
IVYB is released, and the IVY in the escrow agreement is claimed by the lvy Network. The IVY receives the determination of the
IVYB transaction on the Ivy Private Network ledger through the use of the Ivy Oracle Service and its constituent validators to
the Ivy Private Network. When the IVYB was committed to the ivyReceive Contract, the public address of the sender to the IVYB
will be recorded. This public address was used for sending the Ivy transaction containerof KYC/AML information. Subsequently,

13. https://www.yodlee.com/
14. https://www.xignite.com/
15. https://www.plaid.com/

lvy White Paper v1.5 June 2018
this address is used as a settlement account address for the lvy Network to privately settle its own transactions against the
network.

2) Identity on the Ivy Network
When fully developed, it is intended that the Company will manage two types of identities on the lvy Network: sender identities,
and financial institution and intermediaries identities.

a. Sender Identity

The Ivy Network is intended to require senders to register with the network prior to sending currency. It is assumed by the Ivy
Network that recipients are identified by their respective financial institutions and intermediaries as part of establishing an
account.

For establishing a sender account on the Ivy Network, self-sovereign identity is sufficient; however, additional transaction
information may be required for authorization against the Ivy Network. This information is submitted and stored by the

sender on the Ivy Network to establish an account and allow for the Company to provide attestation for specific transaction
types where supporting information is required. Copies of sender sovereign identity information are packaged in the Ivy

data container as part of the submission of the transaction to the intended balance recipient's financial institution and other
intermediaries. While specifically restricted to their purposes, these credentials may be accessed and are relevant for extended
periods of time beyond the transaction. Using the Company's website, it is possible to monitor who and when these credentials
are being accessed on a continuing basis.

b. Financial Institution and Intermediary Identity

It is intended that Ivy will rely on the good hiring practice and vigilance of information security practices at the financial
institutions and intermediaries where it communicates data. It would be largely impractical for the Company to keep track of
all employment events, corporate and HR-related activities. Accordingly, the lvy Network will require the identity of relevant
compliance staff at financial institutions, intermediaries, and interested agencies to be registered with the Ivy Network for the
purpose of enabling and disabling access to distributed containers of KYC/AML data. The lvy Network will be updated on
relevant employment actions of financial intermediaries on a timely basis.

It is anticipated that financial institution managers may log into the lvy Network to manage the access and permissions of
relevant staff to ivyReceive Contract functions and container data. All activities of identified users can be centrally tracked and
managed, and individual transaction container history viewed.

3) Blockchain Technology Application

Consensus on distributed ledger is the function by which validators, sometimes called miners, determine the accurate
representation of data as appropriate to reflect correct ledger balances given the transactions submitted to the network. Given
the opportunity for network and system disruptions, it is easy to anticipate that there are opportunities by which some parties
may be disconnected and miss important data during their unexpected absences.

Just the same, in a network where there are shared perspectives, there need to be established mechanisms to come by one
settled outcome of the truth. In networks such Bitcoin and Ethereum, the current mechanism is called ‘proof of work’. Proof of
work encourages validators to compete on the basis of computing power and electricity to validate transactions submitted to
the network. Having more computing power helps validators solve cryptographically difficult problems that are subsequently
submitted to the network for the right to append captured transactions as blocks to the network (incidentally, these blocks
of transactions are validated on the predication of other blocks that have been previously submitted, creating a chain—
hence the term ‘blockchain’). As the blockchain grows, new blocks increase in difficulty to append—and validators compete
at great expense for the value of both validation incentives and block rewards they hope to capture and redistribute within
their networks. While providing for a notion of byzantine fault tolerance, this process is both expensive and slow for a private
network. Consequently, this is why Bitcoin and Ethereum both process fewer than 20 transactions per second"*. Alternatively,
a consensus mechanism called ‘proof of stake’, implemented by Tendermint and proposed as the ‘Casper’ consensus
improvement to Ethereum moves the expense of gaining the right to append ledger transaction blocks from investment in
computing and electrical power to investment in the cryptocurrency itself"”. In proof of stake, a party with proportionally more

16. http://www.altcointoday.com/bitcoin-ethereum-vs-visa-paypal-transactions-per-second/
17. CIT

June 2018 Ivy White Paper v1.5
cryptocurrency has proportionally more likelihood of appending the next block of transactions. Because each validator is
‘staked! in the network, the network can potentially punish the validator by reclaiming their interests in the network for malicious
behaviour that results in the production of false transaction blocks that requires subsequent correction by the rest of the
network. Challenges occur from this approach for two main reasons, however: a) any single party or colluding parties with 51%
of the network value has a greater likelihood of wining consensus; and b) a malicious majority cannot be overruled through the
investment in computing power, as proof of work allows. Moreover, just as proof of work requires validation incentives to for
validators to capture transactions in the form of block rewards, proof of stake similarly uses incentives (e.g.: ‘gas’) to prevent the
submission of transactions that create work without commensurate financial value on the network (e.g.: spam).'®

In financial payments networks, specifically private and permissioned network are more readily organized and governed by
shared interest than public anonymous networks, so issues of aligning incentives to prevent suspect behaviour give yield

to concerns regarding practical throughput and resilience of coordinating functions that facilitate accurate and compliant
settlement. Networks including Stellar and Ripple use their own validators, or shared participation of validators to shield their
direct inputs to network results,'? whereby external and malicious participants are unlikely. Here, their consensus is focused on
resilience and availability of distributed ledgers through their networks. As a result, throughputs are higher.2°

The Company envisions the Ivy Private Network as consisting of validation nodes sponsored by entities other than itself. The lvy
Private Network will be validated directly by financial institutions and intermediaries, who are independent, yet aligned. In this
environment, spam messages from permissioned network participants seem highly unlikely, and even deleterious to their shared
goals for participating in the lvy Network in the first place. Greatly reduced likelihood of network spam and aligned incentives
removes the need for block rewards that typically incentivize public blockchain networks. For consensus, the use of a scheduled
byzantine fault tolerant algorithm, such as Istanbul BFT makes most sense.’ In this consensus algorithm, each participant
creates blocks on a scheduled, round-robin basis and submits its results to the rest of the network, which must vote with a 2/3
majority to approve the leader's block calculation. This approach allows approximately 1/3 of validators on the network may
prove to be malicious while still proving the network resilient. Specific benchmarks of Istanbul BFT indicate that it is capable

of ~1000 transactions per second,” which reflects the total estimated network of interagency transactions that happen today
between FedWire, SWIFT, and ACH today?

For its purposes, it is anticipated that the Ivy Private Network will initially adopt the use of Quorum, JP Morgan Chase's
implementation of permissioned Ethereum using the Istanbul BFT consensus algorithm.” This implementation of Ethereum
has a number of potential benefits for the lvy Network: a) it provides the benefits of the Ethereum blockchain as validated and
improved in the context of a global financial institution; b) it provides interoperability with smart contract development and
investment that can be prototyped and made portable to any number of other Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) supporting
environments (including Ethermint, Qtum, and even the public Ethereum blockchain);?°* and, c) given its familiarity as an
alternative blockchain in the financial community, its adoption and use provides a baseline of community and support most
likely to be echoed in the same financial institutions and intermediaries that the Company seeks to support its network
functions. Quorum additionally supports alternative consensus algorithms based on authority of the leading validator, should
higher transaction throughput be required and stability of the intentions of network participants allow for reductions in block
validation overhead.

18. In public settings, potential spam transactions can crowd legitimate transactions, creating an environment similar to that which exists
in the settings of a denial of service attack; if validators are consuming effort with worthless transactions, valuable transactions have a
harder time being processed.

19. CIT- Stellar sharding

21. Byzantine fault tolerance or (BFT) is a reference to a problem in computer science that addresses coordination issues within networks of
distributed systems, commonly referred to as the byzantine generals problem, whereby any single system actor, left to their own devices, is
incentivized to work in their own interest, instead of the honest interests of the network.

4) Ivy Data Containers

It is anticipated that the Ivy Network will use dxChain cryptographic containers to store KYT/KYC/AML data in a date container
(Ivy Data Container). Users submit their data through the distributed application interface on the Ivy web site at the time they
request the transfer of currency. This specific container format of the Ivy Data Container is shown in figure below:

Using this format, each component of supporting data is independently and persistently encrypted to secure access at rest
and during exchange using standard AES-256 symmetric and 4096 bit RSA asymmetric cryptographic methods, and SHA-384
message digests. Digital signature based on RSA asymmetric keys are anticipated as vulnerable to both Grover's”? and

the factoring of large numbers, respectively, these algorithms will be upgraded to reflect the availability of quantum resistant
algorithms, as better understanding and support by industry becomes available.*!

Cryptographic containers are intended to provide for a few key features to the lvy Network:
+ Provide persistent control and protection of all communicated information;
+ Provide ability for the lvy Network to add or remove parties to the container after initial receipt; and

+ Provide the sender with surety that the specifics of their transaction with the recipient are confidential.
Through the use of lvy Data Containers, individual behaviours against the network can be tracked and verified.

Ivy Data Containers are intended to store both structured and unstructured content collected from the ivySend Contract
submission process. Where applicable, lvy normalizes the collection of data within the lvy Data Container to comply with data
sets, codes, and formats of the ISO 20022 standard.*”

a. Generation and Storage of Ivy Data Containers

When fully developed, upon submission of content to an Ivy Network contract, a request is made to the Ivy Network to generate
a container of the relevant data. The application will send submitted KYT/KYC/AML data to the lvy Network, and return the
container identifier back to the sender. The sender submits their lvy deposit and the generated container identifier to the
ivySend Network contract.

When generated, the Ivy Data Container becomes resident on an IPFS file system that is hosted within the scope of the Ivy
Private Network. The lvy Private Network file system will allow for sharing of relevant content within the network.® Three
separate writes of the container are made to the Ivy Private Network to ensure file redundancy, as only local copies are
guaranteed upon request. A mapping of these container identifiers and object identification points on the Ivy Private Network
are stored in a BigchainDB network that is shared between the nodes of the Ivy Private Network.*+

Retrieving lvy Data Containers involves querying the BigchainDB network by the container identifier of the generated container
to receive the relevant object identifiers for retrieving related containers. Within the lvy Network, this functionality is abstracted
and maintained by a hosted service on the permissioned network. lvy Data Containers may be copied and stored freely without
violating their underlying security model.

b. Accessing Ivy Data Containers

It is intended that access to Ivy Data Containers is managed by a network-bound access management service, that is
responsible for handling requests for specific portions of lvy Data Container content and providing requisite access on the basis
of the following criteria (for the purpose of simplification, users, systems, and processes of systems are treated as user requests):

a) the requesting user's organization — the determination of whether the KYC data relates to a transaction that occurred by the
requesting user's organization, or, alternatively, if the requesting user's organization is a regulator;

b) the requesting user's submitted credentials — the determination of whether the requesting user's credentials are current per
communication between Ivy Private Network account holders and the Ivy identity management environment; and

c) specific administrative restrictions placed on the requesting user's submitted credentials and the specific types of identity
information being requested. For example, specific information identified as Personally Identifiable Information may not
be available to all requesting users. These restrictions are coordinated between administrators from constituent financial
institutions and the Ivy Network.

Upon successful authorization to the lvy Data Container, requested content is presented to the requesting user or process.

Rights and Tokens are considered highly speculative and the purchase of Rights and Tokens carries
with it a number of risks. The Directors strongly recommend that potential purchasers consider

the risk factors described below, together with information contained elsewhere in this paper, and
consult their professional advisers before deciding whether to acquire Rights and Tokens.

If any of the following risks are unacceptable to potential purchasers, then the potential purchaser
should not purchase Rights or Tokens.

The order of the risks set out below is not intended to

have any bearing on the likelihood of such risk arising, or Tokens may be stored in a wallet and be accessible with

not purchase Rights or Tokens.

Tokens are based on cryptocurrency protocols. Any
malfunction, unexpected functioning, forking, breakdown

or abandonment of the lvy protocol may have a material
adverse effect on Tokens. For example, this might adversely
impact a purchaser's ability to transfer or securely hold
Tokens. In addition, advances in cryptography or the
development of quantum computing, could render
ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that
underpins the lvy protocol. Any such impact could adversely
affect the value of Tokens.

June 2018 Ivy White Paper v1.5

-

Mining attacks

Tokens are susceptible to attacks by miners in the course of validating Token transactions on the Ivy blockchain, including,
but not limited to, double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, selfish-mining attacks and race condition attacks.
Any successful attacks present a risk to the Tokens, including, but not limited to, accurate execution, recording of transactions
involving Tokens and expected proper payment operations.

Hacking, cyber threats and security weaknesses

Hackers, individuals, other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the Tokens and any platform on
which they are traded in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-
based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing.

Advances in code cracking, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers, could present risks to the
Tokens, which could result in the theft or loss of Tokens.

Markets risk
The Company cannot fully control the actions of any or all purchasers of Tokens. Even if secondary trading of Tokens is
facilitated by third party exchanges, such exchanges may be relatively new and subject to little or no regulatory oversight,
making them more susceptible to fraud or manipulation. Furthermore, to the extent that third parties do ascribe an external
exchange value to Tokens (e.g. as denominated in a fiat currency), such value may be extremely volatile and diminish to nil. If a
purchaser chooses to use Tokens on exchanges it is at the purchaser's own risk. Such exchanges are independent of and are not
operated or controlled by the Company.

Risk of exchanges
Cryptocurrency exchanges on which Tokens may trade may be relatively new and are likely to be largely unregulated and may
therefore be more exposed to fraud and failure than well-established regulated exchanges. Where cryptocurrency exchanges
representing a substantial portion of the volume in Token trading are involved in fraud or experience security failures or other
operational issues, such cryptocurrency exchange failures may result in a reduction in the price and value of Tokens.

Uninsured and transaction losses

Unlike funds held in accounts at banks or some other financial institutions, Tokens are generally uninsured unless a purchaser
specifically obtains private insurance. In the event of loss of Tokens or the loss of the ability to use the Tokens, there is no public
insurer or private insurance arranged in respect of the Tokens.

If Tokens are stolen or incorrectly transferred, such Tokens may not be recoverable and the Company takes no responsibility
for their recovery. As a result, any incorrectly executed Token transactions could adversely affect the value of Tokens.
Cryptographic token transactions are not reversible without the consent and active participation of the recipient of the
transaction or, in theory, control or consent of a majority of the processing power on the host blockchain platform. Once a
transaction has been verified and recorded in a datablock that is added to the blockchain, an incorrect transfer of a Token or a
theft of a Token generally will not be reversible and there may be no compensation for or avenues of legal or other recourse in
respect of any such transfer or theft. Such loss could adversely affect the value of Tokens generally.

Uncertain regulations, enforcement actions and geopolitical events

The regulatory status of the cryptographic tokens, blockchain and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in
many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation with respect

to such technology and its applications, including the Tokens. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether legislatures or
regulatory agencies may implement changes to law and regulation affecting blockchain and distributed ledger technology and
its applications, including the Tokens.

Regulatory actions could negatively impact the Tokens in various ways, including, for purposes of illustration only, through a
determination that Tokens are a regulated financial product or instrument in one or more jurisdictions that attracts disclosure,
registration or licensing requirements or by the banning of the use of or dealings with Tokens altogether.

The Company may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make
it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals or meet the
relevant regulatory requirements to operate in such jurisdiction.

lvy White Paper v1.5 June 2018
Political or economic crises may motivate large-scale sales of Tokens, which could result in a reduction in the price and adversely
affect the value of Tokens. Cryptographic tokens such as the Tokens are subject to supply and demand forces based upon the
desirability of an alternative, decentralised means of transacting, and it is unclear how such supply and demand will be impacted
by geopolitical events. Large-scale sales of Tokens would result in a reduction in the liquidity of such tokens.

Tax

The tax characterization of Rights and Tokens and the tax ramifications of holding Rights and Tokens is uncertain in many
jurisdictions. Purchasers must seek their own tax advice in connection with purchasing Rights and Tokens, which may result
in adverse tax consequences to Purchasers, including but not limited to withholding taxes, income taxes and tax reporting
requirements. Purchasers bear the sole responsibility for any taxation requirements, in purchasing, using and holding Tokens.

Unfavourable currency fluctuations

The Company intends to use the proceeds from selling Rights to fund the maintenance and development of the Tokens. The
proceeds of the Offer will be denominated in United States dollars. If the value of United States dollars fluctuates unfavourably
during or after the Offer, the Company may not be able to fund development of the Tokens.

Extreme volatility

Tokens are not intended to represent any formal or legally binding investment and will not necessary be tradable on any public
market once developed. In addition, cryptographic tokens that possess value in public markets have demonstrated extreme
fluctuations in price over short periods of time on a regular basis. Such fluctuations are due to market forces and represent
changes in the balance of supply and demand. Exchanges and public markets are independent of and are not operated by the
Company. Trading on any exchanges or public markets is at each purchaser's own risk and the Company cannot and does not
guarantee any market liquidity or saleability of Tokens.

Additionally, different regulatory requirements in different jurisdictions and the potential inability of citizens of certain
jurisdictions to open accounts at exchanges located throughout the world, the liquidity of Tokens may be materially different in
different jurisdictions. This would likely be reflected in significant price discrepancies between markets. It is also possible that the
value of Tokens will drop significantly in the future. Any such drop in the value of Tokens could adversely impact the Company's
ability to raise funding for continuing operations including the development of the Tokens.

It is possible that a competing cryptographic currency could have features that make it more desirable than Tokens to a material
portion of the cryptographic token user base, or that there could be a general reduction in the use of cryptographic tokens due
to an overall reduction of confidence in the technology. Any such occurrences may result in a reduction in demand for and use
of Tokens, which could have a negative impact on the price of Tokens generally.

In addition, a lack of stability in the cryptocurrency exchanges and the closure or temporary shutdown of cryptocurrency
exchanges due to fraud, business failure, hackers or malware, or government-mandated regulation may result in greater volatility
in the price of Tokens.

Intellectual property rights claims

Third parties may make intellectual property ownership claims relating to the Rights or Tokens and/or their source code or other
underlying intellectual property. Regardless of the merit of any intellectual property claim or other legal action, any threatened
action may adversely affect the value of Tokens.

Unanticipated risks
The Rights and any to be developed Tokens represent a new and relatively untested technology.

In addition to the risks noted above, there are other risks associated with any purchase of Rights or Tokens, the holding of Rights
and Tokens and the use of Rights and Tokens, including risks that the Company has not anticipated.

Unanticipated risks may come in the form of variations or combinations of the risks set out above or otherwise.

June 2018 Ivy White Paper v1.5
ETHEREUM

Ethereum is a leading decentralized platform for smart
contracts, utilizing the Solidity programming language. It is an
open source, public blockchain-based distributed computing
platform.

ETHER
The value token of the Ethereum blockchain platform is
called “ether’.

SMART CONTRACTS

Smart Contracts are programming abstractions that
explicitly represent the exact terms of the exchange
relationship between parties. Smart Contract terms must be
satisfied and confirmed as “truth” prior to a transaction to
be recorded and executed. The Smart Contracts are written
in a programming language called Solidity. All such Smart
Contracts are stored publicly on every blockchain node.

IPFS
Is an open source, decentralized file system protocol that

provides a permanent method for the creation, storage
and sharing of documents. IPFS nodes form the basis of
the distributed file sharing network. It is a high throughput,
based on a block storage model. It utilizes hashes for file
identification that can create a robust environment for the
unalterable data storage.

SOLIDITY
Smart Contracts for blockchain are written in a programming
language called Solidity.

x509

A cryptography standard for the definition of public key
certificates. It is a key component of secure communications
and can be used to validate “digital signatures” in electronic
transactions. X.509 is defined by the International
Telecommunications Union, (ITU) a United Nations agency
charged with the global coordination of telecommunication
and standards.

PKI

Public key infrastructure (PKI) is a set of roles, policies, and
procedures required to create, manage, distribute, use, store,
and revoke digital certificates and is a key component of
public-key based encryption systems.

CHAIN OF TRUST

A chain of trust is established by validating each component
of hardware and software from the bottom up. This ensures
that only trusted software and hardware can be used by
validating each hardware and software component in the
chain.

DATA FIELDS

The amount of data sent in a transaction varies depending
on the requirements as defined by the parties and as
required by the Smart Contract that governs the transaction.
Ivy does not verify Customer data (beyond a simple account
opening process) rather, Ivy facilitates.

ABSTRACT

The company MOAC Blockchain Tech, Inc. (MOAC) has released a next generation blockchain platform. With
a pioneering Multi-Blockchain architecture, MOAC not only addresses the performance and cost issues with
existing blockchain systems, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, but also introduces new features that minimize
the barrier to entry for developers, users, businesses, and the entirety of the blockchain ecosystem. The new
platform achieves this by using a layered Multi-Blockchain architecture, blockchain sharding, MicroChain™
Smart Contracts, and Cross-Chain capabilities.

The underlying architecture of the MOAC Platform is a Multi-Blockchain consisting of a global primary
blockchain, MotherChain™, and additional MicroChains™. Using blockchain sharding technology, a
MicroChain™ functions as a child blockchain within the platform that operates above the global
MotherChain™, and is responsible for Smart Contracts management. MicroChains™ also enable high volume
transactions using a variety of consensus systems. Consensus systems are an agreement system that provides
accountability and verification of transactions.

The platform’s advanced layered Multi-blockchain architecture increases overall transaction processing
speeds up to 100x faster (TPS) than existing blockchain platforms. Meanwhile, MicroChains™ enhance token
concurrency rates up to 10,000 times, for a truly scalable solution.

MicroChains™ significantly reduce the cost of smart contract operations and allow developers to rapidly test
different application and service ideas. MOAC’s MicroChains™ are able to interconnect with all other non-
MOAC blockchains using Cross-Chain capabilities. This allows both users and their decentralized
applications (DApps) to migrate easily to the MOAC Platform, with no prior blockchain knowledge. It also
provides a decentralized file storage solution which is currently missing from other major blockchains.

MOAC incentivizes mining as well as rewards for the entire ecosystem. The MotherChain™ uses a proven
Proof of Work (PoW) model, similar to Ethereum, so that miners and mining pools have opportunities to
participate in mining the MotherChain™. The MOAC Platform provides additional MicroChain™ mining and
validation and provides mechanisms for mining from mobile devices, including smart phones.

By reducing the barrier to entry for both mobile users and server farms, the MOAC Platform offers a truly
scalable ecosystem for developers and their Smart Contracts, enabling developers to create innovative
DApps with lower operating costs, enhanced capabilities, and improved performance without a reduction in
security.

@) PROBLEM STATEMENT

Existing technologies and blockchain platforms suffer from steep learning
curves, unnecessary complexity, and high usage fees - all of which impact
adoption and scalability. Existing platforms have low performance
transactions-per-second (TPS), fixed consensus models, and are not able
to quickly adapt to the ever growing needs of developers. Currently,
mining in the blockchain community is highly centralized and doesn't
properly incentivize new users and interested consumers due to
complexity and the cost of required hardware.

These blockchain platforms are also alienated from each other and unable
to communicate effectively with other cryptocurrencies, Smart Contracts,
and blockchain systems. This has created a highly segregated blockchain
marketplace, separating platforms, technology, user-base, and industry.

It is currently extremely challenging
even for experienced technical
developers to build new blockchains.
To make matters even more
complicated, most blockchains are
difficult to upgrade, and_ split
participation inefficiently between
users.

DA A MULTI-BLOCKCHAIN SOLUTION:
THE MOAC PLATFORM

The Silicon Valley based company, MOAC Blockchain Tech, Inc. (MOAC),
has addressed the primary inefficiencies of existing blockchain platforms
by developing a Multi-Blockchain platform. The MOAC Platform uses an
advanced layered architecture that lowers DApp developer costs,
provides for scalability, and reduces development complexity while
increasing transaction speeds and volume using sharding. MOAC
leverages Multi-Blockchain within its platform, including MotherChain™
a Proof of Work based blockchain) and MicroChains™ for Smart
Contracts supporting multiple consensus models. The MOAC Platform
also has Cross-Chain capabilities to interconnect MicroChains™ within
the system and to interconnect with 3rd party non-MOAC blockchain and
cryptocurrencies.

THE MOAC PLATFORM

By separating balance transfer and Smart Contracts, the platform’s advanced
layered Multi-blockchain architecture increases overall transaction
processing speeds up to 100x faster (TPS) than Ethereum. The MOAC
architecture is overviewed below, consisting of MotherChain™, an event
handling system, Smart Contracts as MicroChains™, blockchain sharding,
Cross-Chain capabilities, security, and an API.

kinds of user-defined VMs.

MICROCHAINS™ FOR VARIABLE
CONSENSUS SYSTEMS

With the ability to have MicroChains™ in a layer above the
MotherChain™, each MicroChain™ can have its own unique consensus
system and algorithm.

For example, you could create a MicroChain™ which uses a Proof of Stake
consensus model specifically for scalable rapid high volume transactions.
A Proof of Stake (PoS) is a type of algorithm by which a cryptocurrency
blockchain network aims to achieve distributed consensus.

Instead of processing large amounts of data like a strictly Proof of Work
blockchain, a Proof of Stake blockchain relies on validator nodes within a
network to verify transactions. In Proof of Stake blockchains, the creator

LA MOA ©MOAC Blockchain Tech, Inc. All Rights Reserved. All content is confidential and property of MOAC Blockchain Tech, Inc. 7
of the next sequential block is chosen by randomized algorithms based on
a combination of factors such as wealth or age (l.e., the stake).

The advantage of a Proof of Stake system is that it is fully scalable for
enterprise-level volume, is energy efficient, and supports variable
transactions. It also increases verification capacity proportional to the
number of nodes on the network, and enables microtransactions within
DApp MicroChains™ without having to constantly access the
MotherChain™.

In addition to Proof of Stake and Proof of Work blockchains, the MOAC
Platform can also support additional plug-and-play consensus systems
such as Proof of Activity, Proof of Burn, Proof of Elapsed Time, etc.

the cost of deployment for developers, and enables them to build high
transaction volume based DApps.

(EI ASYNCHRONOUS SMART CONTRACTS

Using Multi-Blockchain architecture, the platform leverages
Asynchronous Smart Contracts with MicroChains™ to accelerate DApp
development and deployment. This advanced architecture design also
extends the functionality of Solidity and Ethereum Smart Contracts.

The MOAC Platform supports two types of Smart Contracts:

1. An Upper Layer Smart Contract is a protocol based contract for
defining consensus systems within a MicroChain™. MicroChain™
Smart Contracts also enable nodes to register into mining pools.

2. A Lower Layer MotherChain™ Global Smart Contract defines the
behavior of the control flows of multiple MicroChains™ including
flushing, rewarding miners, and how to punish bad actors. It provides a
flexible environment enabling DApps to use different kinds of virtual
machines including Ethereum, Java (JVM), and other developer-
selected virtual machines.

BLOCKCHAIN SHARDING

The MOAC Platform also provides blockchain sharding, a feature to
horizontally partition data across multiple blockchains and nodes. Existing
blockchain solutions are inefficient and process the same task multiple
times which degrades system performance. Sharding helps by using a
node based approach, providing more processing power proportional to
the number of nodes in the network.

LA MOAC © MOAC Blockchain Tech, Inc. All Rights Reserved. All content is confidential and property of MOAC Blockchain Tech, Inc 10
When smart contracts are deployed developers will define the number of
service nodes, a consensus protocol, block size, block generation time, and
flush frequency. This will then form a shard and provide a byzantine fault
tolerant solution for that smart contract, which then forms a
MicroChain™.

OO®

This is very similar to database sharding, however blockchain sharding is a
type of blockchain partitioning that separates very large blockchain nodes
into smaller, faster, and more easily managed shards.

By using this solution, the platform is able to scale more effectively,
significantly increasing transactions-per-second (TPS) by extending the
network with more nodes. Sharding subdivides the whole network into
multiple shards, and as long as there are sufficient nodes in each shard, the
system is still highly secure. This allows for secure processing of parallel

transactions, further increasing the number of transactions-per-second
(TPS) over existing blockchain solutions.

Cross-Chain functionality enables MOAC to interact with a variety of
blockchain systems within the platform as well as externally to 3rd party
blockchains and cryptocurrencies.

MicroChains™

The MOAC Platform is able to swap blocks and data between multiple
blockchains and use atomic swap based Cross-Chains. Cross-Chains are a
trust based system for atomically swapping cryptocurrencies in a single
transaction between various blockchains and cryptocurrencies.

The MOAC Platform offers two types of Cross-Chains:

1. Cross-Chains between MicroChains™ and blockchains within
the MOAC Platform

2. Atomic swap cross-chain transactions with other non-MOAC
blockchain systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum

GQ EVENTHANDLING

Above the distributed network layer of the MotherChain™ is an Event
Handling system for network event requests and replies. It also processes
control flow requests and can invoke Smart Contract related operations.
The event handling system relays transaction calls between multiple
layers within the platform multi-directionally, and is primarily used for all
balance transfers, global Smart Contract control, flushing, and other
consensus related messaging.

=F MINING

Mining is the process by which transactions are verified. It is the means
through which new MOAC coins are released and rewarded to miners for
the results of their computing processing power and storage.

The MOAC Platform has two types of mining:

1. MicroChain™ Mining

The upper layer of the MOAC Platform where a node verifies
transactions for smart contracts and other consensus systems.
Each node is rewarded for processing Smart Contracts and
verifying transactions. Mining for MicroChains™ will be
rewarded with MOAC tokens and tokens associated with that
specific MicroChain™.

t API

The platform API provides a quick start for DApp developers by providing
easy access points for DApps to access blockchain specific functions
without having to know the specifics of blockchain implementation. This
enables developers to build complex applications by simply calling those
functions from the MOAC Platform.

‘@= SECURITY
fos)

MOAC prioritizes security first. When developing the platform, the
MOAC team reviewed the security settings and measures of all major
blockchain systems in order to utilize the best practices in the market.
During their audit of existing blockchain security, they found several
vulnerabilities in existing blockchain solutions and were able to predict
several exploits which have been patched in The MOAC Platform.

When code is committed to the platform there is a thorough security
review process in place to comply with all OWASP Top 10 security
vulnerability measures. The MOAC team - in partnership with other high
profile security organizations - has also prepared counter measures and
solutions to address common and future attacks. MOAC routinely
employs contracted blackhat and whitehat security firms to analyze the
platform for vulnerabilities.

OAC will also be issuing a bounty program for exploits and bugs making
it more profitable for hackers to inform on security issues instead of
attempting to ransom users. Meanwhile, the platform’s intelligently
designed architecture isolates each MicroChain™, limiting the potential
attack capabilities on each Smart Contract.

At the core of the MOAC Platform are the users that power it, the
developers who create DApps, the end-users who use those DApps, and
the miners and node operators who keep the network running gracefully.

MOAC will be providing an extensive wiki, tutorials, a glossary of terms,
white papers, a knowledge base, help desk, and other user resources, and
is committed to staying actively engaged with user communities on
Telegram, Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms.

Beyond Cross-Chain capabilities that enable interconnectivity with other
blockchains and cryptocurrencies, the platform also runs on a
foundational P2P distributed network. By using a P2P network, the
atform is able to provide a distributed network for DApps to interact
with each other.

[e}

The P2P network is the underlying layer of communication between any
singular or grouped nodes running the same protocol. A node in this use
case refers to a client that is sharing blocks and transactions across the
network. Nodes communicate by sending messages using RLPx, an
encrypted and authenticated transport protocol.

@ Quality of Service

DApps will run more efficiently on the MOAC Platform when
compared with other platforms. Since Ethereum is limited by its
scalability and transactions-per-second, it inherently cannot handle
arge transactions and computation volume. That is why a simple
game like CryptoKitties caused a traffic jam in the entire Ethereum
network. A similar jam caused as a result of 10 apps or 100 apps
running together on Ethereum could be even more catastrophic.

e@ Cost

Itis very costly to run a Smart Contract or DApp on Ethereum. Each
transaction initiated or triggered by the Smart Contract requires a
certain amount of gas. The average amount of gas per transaction is
very high, which means the cost per transaction is very high. If some
Smart Contracts trigger many transactions, that means the
developers or users of the Smart Contract must pay a lot of
currency, crypto or otherwise, to maintain the DApp.

The MOAC Platform boasts lower-layer transaction costs at 1/10th
the cost of Ethereum, and the upper layer contract calls are free.

7. Welcome to the New Economy
Introduction

When Voyager's CEO, Stephen Ehrlich, first
started off in the financial services industry in
the mid-1990’s, online trading as we know it
today did not exist. At the time, trades needed
to be executed by calling your broker on the
telephone. Your broker would then call floor
brokers who would negotiate a trade through the
“open-outcry” method on the floor of the stock
exchange to execute the order. In 1999, Steve
was a member of the TIR Securities Company
that was acquired by E*TRADE, a brand new
player in the brokerage space pioneering the
revolutionary new idea of online trading.

At the time, most brokers didn’t understand
how online trading would be relevant, but Steve
and E*TRADE knew it was time for a change.
E*TRADE changed the game by bringing more
power and access to customers and made it
cheap and easy to trade. Where the traditional
brokers such as Shearson, Citigroup and Merryl
Lynch were stuck in the fragmented “call your
broker” method, 1999’s E*TRADE was just
getting started disrupting the way people
traded securities.

Today, we see a similar opportunity brewing in
the crypto market. Dozens of companies are
launching their own crypto exchanges or liquidity
venues leading to a highly fragmented and
confusing market for consumers. The barriers
to entry which exist for new customers in the
exchange-based crypto market are similar to
the barriers that existed in the “call your broker”
market in 1999, hurting customers looking for
a cheap and easy execution.

In today's crypto market, customers have to
open accounts at dozens of exchanges, every
exchange is competing for liquidity, exchanges
are potentially dangerous due to hacks/fraud,

exchange fees are high and the markets

are highly fragmented leading to large price
disparities across exchanges. With over 200
exchanges in the crypto markets, the space is
ripe for a regulated crypto broker to disrupt the
status quo.

Voyager is an online brokerage dedicated to
crypto and digital assets. Voyager is a
regulated crypto broker that gives investors
the same easy, safe and convenient experience
that made online equities trading the force it

is today. Voyager executes orders across mul-
tiple exchanges, offering “Best Execution” and
giving customers access to an extremely

liquid market.

With our trading apps and industry-leading
crypto infrastructure, we're excited to offer
investors a fast, secure, commission-free
gateway to the crypto market — the broker
that crypto deserves.

Vision & Mission

Our vision is to provide individuals and
institutions with the best way to transfer, trade
and store digital assets. Our mission is to make
crypto markets accessible, open, safe, and fair
for everyone. We believe that by giving customers
access to the crypto markets without having

to go through hundreds of exchanges, we are
leveling the playing field for customers and
helping them become more informed. The crypto
market is ready for a change.
Problems & Solutions

With big challenges come big opportunities. We believe that a Regulated
Crypto Broker is desperately needed to fill the execution and accessibility
gap around lack of liquidity, high fees, inaccessibility and consumer
protection. We plan to address the following problems:

LACK OF LIQUIDITY

Liquidity is the foundational economic
protocol for the future of money and it
still remains largely unsolved. Crypto
markets are fragmented, custodied funds
are often illiquid or inaccessible and
consumers pay high execution fees while
never getting best execution. The lack of
liquid and fair execution can often cause
variances of several percentage points,
costing customers exorbitant amounts.

HIGH FEES

Buying or selling cryptocurrency can
incur high spreads and fees. Often
consumers don’t know how to get the
best price or if their exchange is trading
for them or against them. Many cryp-
tocurrency providers operate both retail
Bitcoin purchasing operations and their
own exchanges, creating conflicts

of interest in pricing. Some may even
trade against their customers using
activity and trade data. In addition to poor
execution, consumers are often paying
high transaction fees.

Solution: Voyager has built a next generation
Dynamic Smart Order Router and Custody solution
to tackle liquidity issues. Orders are routed

and split between exchanges to offer best
execution for consumers. The platform lets you
custody your way with funds that are always
secure and liquid ensuring that your funds are
safe and available when you need them.

Solution: Voyager operates a commission-free
trading service. Consumers are able to trade
with peace of mind knowing that they are getting
the best execution possible without extraneous
fees. Prices are up-front so you know the price
and all fees prior to executing a trade.
TOO INACCESSIBLE

Exchange interfaces can be intimidating
for new customers, and even experienced
traders can’t easily find the best price
across multiple exchanges. Additionally,
mobile access tends to be an afterthought.
Cryptocurrency wallet interfaces often require
advanced technical or cryptographic
knowledge to use and understand. To
truly unlock the transformative power of
blockchain and cryptocurrency, it’s critical
to build for accessibility now, not later.

POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS

It is hard to know who to trust in crypto.
Billions of dollars worth of crypto have
been lost in hacks over the years. Market
leaders who were previously trusted have
disappeared due to hacks or fraud. Many
crypto platforms have inadequate service
and security leaving customers vulnerable.

Team

Solution: The Voyager team has extensive
experience building highly successful consum-
er-centric applications such as Uber, Apple and
E*TRADE which are used by millions of people
around the world. The team plans and builds
every feature with accessibility and ease of
use in mind. Simple and accessible wallet and
trading interfaces will be built using this same
design mentality.

Solution: The Voyager team has an extensive
track record in the traditional financial industry
as well as within the crypto industry. Voyager
builds trust by prioritizing security and acces-
sible self-custody options for customers and
through a public equity building transparency
and trust with consumers. We work with industry
leaders such as Ledger Vault to implement
highly secure, state-of-the-art custody solutions.
Voyager aims to be the safest and most
consumer-oriented place to transfer, custody
and trade crypto.

Voyager's team consists of finance and technology industry veterans
dedicated to empowering and servicing investors in the most exciting
asset class to date — crypto. Our founders have combined their decades
worth of experience from leading organizations like E*TRADE, Uber,
Tradelt, Lightspeed Financial and more, to bring you Voyager.
1. Voyager and Ethos Transaction —

Uniting Custody and Execution

Voyager and Ethos were founded around the same time, but ended

up taking two different paths towards the same goal. While Voyager
focused on the financial and trading aspects of crypto by building a
consumer trading application and an Order Management System (OMS),
Ethos focused on blockchain technology and abstracting the underlying
protocols that powered crypto through their Universal Wallet application
and Bedrock architecture. When the Ethos and Voyager teams first met,
the synergy was immediately obvious. The technology platform, teams,
market vision and even company cultures were highly complementary

and synergistic and a joint organization would be extremely well
positioned to challenge the incumbents in the crypto space.

In 2019, the Voyager and Ethos teams agreed
to a transaction to bring the technology together,
with a shared vision of making the organization
a force in the crypto industry through deep,
unparalleled trading and cryptocurrency
technology offerings. Voyager and Ethos saw
the opportunity to disrupt incumbents in the
space while expanding the market through a
combined sophisticated technological capability
to build a superior offering.

The two organizations have a shared vision of
building crypto markets that are accessible,
open, safe and fair for everyone, and saw an
opportunity to come together to create some-
thing greater than each individual organization.
Voyager will bring the first true end-to-end
solution to the crypto market — a solution that
the crypto market deserves.

1.1 ABOUT ETHOS

Ethos is a leading cryptocurrency technology
and service provider with two core products,
the Ethos Universal Wallet and Ethos Bedrock.

The Ethos Universal Wallet is the easiest way
to store, track, send and receive digital assets.
The Ethos Universal Wallet is self-custodied
using a unique digital SmartKey or 24 word
phrase that gives you complete control over all
of your addresses across multiple assets types
and blockchains. Using the Universal Wallet,
you can broadcast and verify transactions to
multiple blockchains directly from your mobile
device. The Universal Wallet also has in-depth
pricing, charting, ratings, reviews and portfolio
reporting so you can learn about different digital
assets and track their performance.
Ethos Bedrock is a high performance institutional
abstraction layer that makes it easier for
developers and institutions to build sophisticated
blockchain-based applications. Bedrock enables
developers to programmatically create blockchain
addresses, broadcast and verify transactions
and monitor blockchain addresses, all through
an easy API using GraphQL which is the same
technology Facebook uses to let developers
access their social graph. The Ethos Universal
Wallet is built 100% on Bedrock, demonstrating
that the platform works at scale and can support
thousands of users worldwide.

With Ethos merging into Voyager, the Ethos
Universal Wallet and Ethos Bedrock product
offerings become official product offerings

of Voyager. These two products give Voyager
sophisticated crypto functionality and proto-
col-level connections to build the best possible
products for customers.

2. Solving For Liquidity, Custody
and Accessibility

The two biggest unsolved problems in the crypto space are Liquidity,
Custody, and Accessibility. Nobody has built a retail agency broker in
the crypto space that can guarantee that an individual or institutional
market participant is getting Best Execution across all the coins that
they want to trade. No company has built a blended custody/self-custody
solution that can service both audiences while remaining fast, liquid,
competitive and secure. Giving customers proper liquidity and custody
services, best-execution, an accessible interface, international support
and broad access to coins is the missing link for many cryptocurrency
traders and investors. We're bridging the gap.
2.1 WHY LIQUIDITY?

Despite all the technical progress, the crypto
markets today look much like the fragmented
and inefficient “call your broker” equities markets
that existed back in the 1990’s, but with even
fewer investor protections. Best Execution and
National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO) are core to
those protections.

Even if you've traded stocks your entire adult
life, you may have never heard of NBBO or Best
Execution. That's because it’s not something
that your broker typically advertises. In the
traditional stock market, offering best
execution is not a differentiator, it’s the law.
Best Execution is guaranteed by National Best
Bid and Offer (NBBO), a regulation that requires
brokers to execute trades at the best available
ask or bid price when buying securities on
behalf of their clients. FINRA defines best
execution as “a significant investor protection
requirement that essentially obligates a
broker-dealer to exercise reasonable care to
execute a customer's order in a way to obtain
the most advantageous terms for the customer.”
A broker's purpose is non-negotiable — provide
the customer with the best execution as quickly
as possible.

The New York Attorney General's pointed out in a
September 2018 Virtual Markets Integrity Report
report that conflicts of interest often arise in
exchanges that have become “verticalized”
meaning the same group who is operating

as an exchange is also operating as a broker
and a custodian. Regulators in the traditional

space encourage or sometimes even require
separation between the broker, exchange and
custodian roles due to the inevitable conflicts
of interest that can arise. This verticalization
often prevents consumers from getting quality
service and value, since the exchange sources
from their own liquidity instead of serving the
customer's interest by sourcing liquidity from
anywhere it exists.

With Voyager's Smart Order Router, orders

are always guaranteed best execution. The
Smart Order Router aggregates liquidity across
dozens of exchanges and liquidity providers in
order to find the optimal execution to maximize
the buying power of every consumer or insti-
tutional investor. Voyager's routing technology
gives the same benefit that a customer would
get if they opened multiple accounts across
multiple exchanges, searched for the best
price and placed orders - except it’s all done
from a single account through a convenient
mobile application.

2.2 WHY CUSTODY?

Part of the reason institutional capital has
stayed on the sidelines in the cryptocurrency
arena is the lack of an institutional custody
solution that can offer the “custody trifecta”:
Liquidity, Speed, and Security. A custodian is
a financial institution that holds customers’
securities for safekeeping in order to minimize
the risk of loss or theft. Crypto custodians
often store funds on paper wallets to make
hacking and theft extremely difficult. This
“cold” storage makes deposits and withdrawals
slow and illiquid especially during times of high
customer activity. Alternatively, funds can be
stored in online “hot” storage, but this often
means limited checks on what comes in

and out and has been one of the predominant
causes of many of the major crypto exchange
hacks that have occurred and resulted in billions
of dollars worth of losses. Because cold storage
is much more secure than hot storage, it’s not
uncommon for a crypto custodian to keep up
to 98% of their funds in cold storage. However,
this means only 2% of funds are immediately
accessible and liquid, causing them to be
overleveraged. Comparing these numbers to
“reserve ratios” that are set in place by gov-
ernments to protect consumers from run on
banks, it becomes immediately obvious

why existing crypto providers often become
inaccessible during active market periods.

Voyager is blending hardware-secured treasury
with self-custody options giving consumers
complete control over how they want to secure
their digital assets. As a Regulated Crypto
Broker, Voyager wants to make sure that every
customer has full access to the market when
they need it without any downtime or caveats.

2.3 WHY ACCESSIBILITY?

Accessibility is one of the biggest barriers

to entry for the crypto market. Whether it is
because new traders find crypto exchange or
wallet interfaces too daunting, that fees too
high or simply that the product or coin isn't
available, there are a lot of reasons for new
crypto investors to find the space difficult and
frustrating. To us accessibility means product
availability, coin tradability and ease of use.

Navigating regulations as an individual,
institution or business in the crypto space can
often be frustrating, but despite this, Voyager
is rapidly expanding product availability both
domestically and internationally. Product avail-
ability often limits a customer's choices as well
as their access to the markets. If you live in a
country where only a few exchanges are accessible
to you, then you are only getting access to a
fraction of the crypto market. Voyager is able
to straddle multiple jurisdictions and handles
the regulatory issues for you so that the only
thing you need to focus on trading.

Furthermore, even once you get onto a trading
platform, their coin selection is often very
limited, but for us at Voyager, coin availability
is a top priority. We want to give customers the
opportunity to trade any asset, whenever or
wherever they want.

3. A Disruptive Product with a Rich

Feature Set

The crypto markets are at an inflection point where more and more exchanges
are being launched, while markets are simultaneously becoming less and less
accessible. Market leaders in the space are vulnerable due to verticalization
and high costs to consumers with poor customer service. A Regulated Crypto
Broker that can simultaneously solve liquidity, custody and accessibility for
individuals and institutions has yet to emerge. Voyager is ready to disrupt

the status quo and set a new standard for how traders and investors should

access the crypto markets.

3.1 BEST-EXECUTION CRYPTO
ORDER ROUTING

Best execution focuses on maximizing
delivery on four pillars of trading:
Price, Speed, Liquidity, and Reliability.

A Price — Voyager's Dynamic Smart Order
Router searches multiple exchanges for
the best possible price. Voyager is con-
nected to a growing number of exchanges
and liquidity providers to maximize price
execution in the fragmented and crossed
crypto markets.

A Liquidity — Depending on the size, your
order may need to be routed to multiple
exchanges or liquidity providers in order
to achieve superior execution. You can
worry about trading, while we handle
the rest.

A Speed — Voyager executes and settles
trades within milliseconds so that you
can maximize your earning opportunities.

A Reliability — Interacting with digital
exchanges for the average consumer can
often be dangerous. Voyager actively
manages reputable exchange connections
to give customers a safe and reliable
trading experience.

Voyager's Dynamic Smart Order Router takes
all of these factors into account when achieving
best execution for trading customers.

3.2 ADVANCED CHARTING, RESEARCH
& REPORTING

Voyager offers a wealth of advanced research
options directly from your mobile device. Multiple
charting options, professional research, coin
specific news feeds and the ability to compare
multiple coin charts at once gives an immense
amount of flexibility and information so trad-
ers never miss a beat in the fast paced crypto
markets. Advanced reporting features such

as profit/loss tracking and aggregate holding
views gives customers the ability to grow their
portfolios with all the information they need at
their fingertips.
4. Introducing VGX — Save Network
Fees, Collect Cashback, Earn Interest

Voyager's Native Broker Token (VGX) is a liquid, functional token that
will provide value and utility across Voyager's entire ecosystem includ-
ing the trading, custody and wallet products. Tokens may be staked or
consumed for a variety of utility that greatly enhances the experience
for customers. By holding VGX, consumers can reap the benefits of
holding their own keys to their crypto funds (“your keys, your coins”)
while also being able to swiftly trade their crypto assets.

4.1 FEE SAVINGS & INSTANT
TRANSACTIONS - WITHDRAWALS
& LIVE TRADING

When using the VGX native broker token, you
get significant value and benefits. As part of
Live Trading, the ability to trade from the self
custody Vault, the VGX token will be enabling
instant blockchain transactions, letting users
get split-second trade execution directly from
self-custody wallets. As part of Live Trading,
VGX holders can utilize tokens to pay for fees
and get discounted fees.

4.2 CASHBACK REWARDS PROGRAM

In addition to the discounts customers receive
for the Withdrawal Fees and Live Trading Fees,
customers will be given access to a unique
rewards system based on VGX token holdings.
Customers can not only trade commission
free, but can also earn money back every time
they trade.

4.3 EARN INTEREST

Voyager is one of the only brokers that offers
interest bearing accounts with no lockups
alongside a competitive trading offering. Users
are given baseline interest rates with the option
to enhance the interest experience through
token functionality.

4.4 ADDITIONAL REWARDS

In addition, the VGX token will give users addi-
tional rewards and benefits. As Voyager adds
products such as debit cards, margin, loans
and integrates the Universal Wallet into the
Voyager applications the VGX token holders
will obtain additional benefits.

6. A Unique
Public Offering

On February 11, Voyager Digital began trading
as a public company on the Canadian mar-
kets under the symbol VYGR, creating a lot

of “firsts” for the crypto industry. The public
company is the first combined crypto broker
and custody solution allowing consumers and
investors to get in on the ground floor of a
disruptive new product. The level of trust and
disclosure that comes with being a public
company is invaluable. New customers can
trust that the company is legitimate service
provider. Voyager is delivering a full crypto
ecosystem with the people-powered mentality
that the company and products were founded
upon and everyone has the opportunity to be a
part of that from the very beginning.

6.1 OPERATING LIKE A FINANCIAL
INSTITUTION

Voyager complies with state, federal and
international regulations and actively collabo-
rates with regulators to adhere to the highest
standards of compliance. We have developed
a regulatory strategy that we believe is future
proofed by obtaining state licenses, developing
deep banking relationships, acquiring a FINRA
Registered Broker/Dealer and actively seeking
approval for the BitLicense in New York. As
the regulatory landscape develops, we will be
prepared to comply with new standards.

Voyager will operate with the same level of

rigor and trust that financial institutions afford.

We take your money very seriously. You can
expect only the highest quality products and
services with around the clock support. This is
how financial services should be.

7. Welcome to the
New Economy

Two established crypto companies with experi-
enced teams are joining forces to build a Reg-
ulated Crypto Broker worthy of the blockchain
revolution. We firmly believe that cryptocurren-
cies are here to stay and that the blockchain
industry is just getting started. Voyager is
committed to playing an integral role in build-
ing the vision of a smart economy — one that
is equitable, fair, safe and accessible. Achieving
meaningful mass adoption of cryptocurrencies
will require a lot of important infrastructure —
and we're here to help make sure it happens,
and happens soon.

We are incredibly excited about the vision and
the work our team is doing and has already
done to bring it to fruition. While we are firm
believers in what we are doing, we find the
best way to convince someone is to show
them our product. Try out our product at

Abstract

This whitepaper introduces the Theta Network, a new blockchain and token as the incentive
mechanism for a decentralized video streaming and delivery network.

The Theta Network and protocol solves various challenges the video streaming industry faces
today. First, Theta Tokens are used as an incentive to encourage individual users to share their
redundant computing and bandwidth resources as caching nodes for video streams. This
improves the quality of stream delivery and solves the “last-mile” delivery problem, the main
bottleneck for traditional stream delivery pipelines, especially for high resolution high bitrate

, 8k and next generation streams. Second, with sufficient amount of caching nodes, the
majority of viewers will pull streams from peering caching nodes. This significantly reduces
content delivery network (CDN) bandwidth costs, which is a major concern for video streaming
sites. Lastly, the Theta Network greatly improves the streaming market efficiency by
reamlining the video delivery process. For example, advertisers can target end viewers at a
lower cost and reward influencers more transparently.

he Theta blockchain introduces novel concepts:

Resource Oriented Micropayment Pool: We have designed and implemented an
off-chain “Resource Oriented Micropayment Pool” that is purpose-built for video
streaming. It allows a user to create an off-chain micropayment pool that any other
user can withdraw from using off-chain transactions, and is double-spend resistant. It
is much more flexible compared to off-chain payment channels.

Proof-of-Engagement: The micropayment records can be used as
“Proof-of-Engagement (PoE)”. Each payment for the video segment is associated with
the ID of the video (i.e. the resource ID) and can be used to track delivery of video
segments to end viewers. With PoE, viewers can earn tokens as rewards from
advertisers in exchange for their attention to video streams and by providing PoE. PoE
is used to prove that viewers legitimately consume the video streams, providing better
transparency and a basis for viewers to earn Theta Tokens for engaging with content.

This white paper will describe these concepts and the Theta blockchain in detail. The Theta

Network launched with ERC20-compliant tokens and were integrated into the SLIVER.tv
platform in December 2017. Anew blockchain and native Theta Tokens is planned to launch in

Q4 2018, at which time each ERC20 Theta Token can be 1:1 exchanged for a native Theta
Token.

Introduction

Video streaming market

Live video streaming accounts for over two-thirds of all internet traffic today, and it is expected
to jump to 82% by 2020, according to Cisco's June 2016 Visual Networking Index report." In the
US, millennials between the ages of 18 and 34 are driving the growth of video streaming, and
are heavy users of services like Instagram, Spotify and Snapchat. Streaming video among this
group has jumped 256% from an average of 1.6 hours per week to 5.7 hours per week
according to a SSRS Media and Technology survey, and mobile devices are leading the charge in
video consumption growing 44% in 2015 and 35% in 2016.’ The top five video streaming
players in the US are Facebook, Google/Youtube, Twitter and related properties, Live.ly and
Twitch.

Video streaming challenges

Content Delivery Network (CDN) plays an important role in the video streaming ecosystem. It
provides the backbone infrastructure to deliver the video streams to the end viewers. One
major limitation of today's CDN networks is the so-called “last-mile” delivery problem.
Typically, the CDN providers build data centers called Point-of-Presences (POPs) in many
ocations around the world, with the hope that these POPs are geographically close to the
viewers. However, the number of POPs are limited, hence cannot be close enough to many
viewers, especially in less developed regions. This “last-mile” link is usually the bottleneck of
he streaming delivery pipeline and often leads to less optimal user experience including
choppy streams and frequent rebuffering.

To streaming sites and platforms, another major concern is the CDN bandwidth cost. For
popular sites, the CDN bandwidth cost can easily reach tens of millions of dollars per year. Even
if platforms own proprietary CDNs, maintenance costs are often high.

These issues are becoming even more prominent with the coming era of 4K, 8k, 360° VR
streaming, and upcoming technologies such as light field streaming. Table 1 compares the
bandwidth requirement of today’s mainstream 720p/HD stream with 4K, 360° VR and future
lightfield streams. Bandwidth requirement jumps quickly by orders of magnitude.

To solve the VR and light field video delivery problem, the industry has started to explore
“foveated streaming” technology. Instead of streaming the entire video in full resolution, this
echnology reduces the image quality in the peripheral vision (outside of the zone gazed by the
ovea) in order to reduce bandwidth requirement. As the viewer turns his or her head to look at
a different direction, the system adapts the spatial video resolution accordingly by fetching the
high resolution video packets for the viewing direction from the server. For the foveated
streaming technology to work well in practice, the round-trip time between the server and the
viewer has to be small enough. For the viewers that are geographically far away for the CDN
POPs, their VR stream viewing experience will be compromised even with foveated streaming
echnology.

Background

SLIVER.tv (the “company”) has been at the forefront of developing next-generation video
streaming technologies for VR and spherical 360° video streams since 2015, and has been
integral in the founding of the Theta Network. SLIVER.tv has raised over $17 Million in venture
inancing from notable Silicon Valley VCs including Danhua Capital, DCM, Sierra ventures,
eading Hollywood media investors including Creative Artists Agency, BDMI, Advancit Capital,
Greycroft Gaming Track Fund, and marquee corporate investors including GREE, Colopl,
Samsung Next and Sony Innovation funds. Additionally, the company has strong Chinese
investors and partners including Heuristic Capital Partners, ZP Capital, Green Pine Capital
Partners, and Sparkland.

Mpany’s mission is to leverage the blockchain technology to create the first

Decentralized Video Streaming and Delivery Network whereby video viewers are incentivized
to share redundant computing and bandwidth resources to address today’s video streaming
challenges. Using the Ethereum EVM “World Computer" metaphor, the Theta Network can be
viewed as the “World Cache” formed by the memory and bandwidth resources contributed by
viewers.

Specifically, viewers around the globe can contribute their devices as “caching nodes” whereby
they form a video delivery mesh network that is responsible for delivering any given video

o viewers anywhere around the world. The Theta Network can effectively address the

technical challenges discussed in the previous section. First, viewers’ devices are geographically

his will help streaming sites reduce their CDN bandwidth cost. Third, caching nodes

also reduce round-trip time making foveated and next generation streaming technology

practical.

To enco

urage viewers to contribute their computing and bandwidth resources, we introduce

the Theta protocol as an incentive mechanism. The caching nodes can earn tokens as they

relay video streams to other viewers. Not only do Theta Tokens motivate viewers to join the
network as caching nodes, it also greatly improves the streaming market efficiency by streamlining

8
the video delivery process. We will discuss more details later in the paper, but within the Theta
Network, advertisers can directly target viewers at a lower cost, viewers earn Theta Tokens for
their attention and engagement with their favorite content, and influencers earn Theta Token
as gifts directly from viewers. Streaming platforms reduce CDN costs and open up new
revenue opportunities with Theta Tokens.

The full launch of the Theta protocol introduces a new blockchain and a native token structure

where:

Advertisers fund ad campaigns with tokens to support influencers, streaming sites
and viewers

Caching nodes earn tokens for caching and relaying video streams to other viewers
Viewers potentially earn tokens from advertisers as engagement rewards, and can in
turn gift to favorite influencers and content creators

Streaming sites and platforms can offload up to 80% of CDN costs and drive new
revenues through Theta powered premium goods and services.

The Theta protocol builds upon the following novel concepts:

Resource Oriented Micropayment Pool: We have designed and implemented an
off-chain “Resource Oriented Micropayment Pool” that is purpose-built for video
streaming. It allows a user to create an off-chain micropayment pool that any other
user can withdraw from using off-chain transactions, and is double-spend resistant. It
is much more flexible compared to off-chain payment channels. In particular, for the
video streaming use case, it allows a viewer to pay for video content pulled from
multiple caching nodes without on-chain transactions. By replacing on-chain
ransactions with off-chain payments, the built-in “Resource Oriented Micropayment
Pool” significantly improves the scalability of the blockchain.

Proof-of-Engagement: The Resource Oriented Micropayment Pool can be leveraged
o track the delivery of the video segments to the end viewers, since each payment
for the video segment is associated with the ID of the video (i.e. the resource ID).
This indicates that the micropayments recorded in the blockchain denote video
segments delivered to end viewers. Thus the micropayment records can be used as
he “Proof-of-Engagement (PoE)”. With PoE, viewers can earn tokens as rewards
rom advertisers in exchange for their attention to video streams and by providing
PoE. PoE not only brings benefits to viewers, but also to advertisers as it provides
hem with a reliable and verifiable engagement measurement of the delivered video
streams. PoE can also be used as a basis to reward the content creators, which could
be done automatically by the validators of the Theta blockchain since PoE can be
inferred from the transaction records.

Theta Decentralized Streaming Network

Overview

Leveraging our experience and expertise in high resolution high bitrate video streaming, we are
proposing a decentralized video stream delivery technology for both video on demand and live
streaming. Figure 3 depicts the high level architecture.

Live-Streaming Video-on-demand

Figure 3. Left - Theta Network architecture diagram for live streaming
Right - Theta Network architecture diagram for video on demand

Figure 3 Left shows the Theta Network architecture for live streaming. The influencers (aka
streamers) publish their video streams to the ingest nodes. Ingest nodes run on computers
contributed by the user community. The ingest nodes are responsible for transcoding the video
stream to different bitrates and resolutions. Then, the caching nodes pull the video streams
and relay to end viewers. Any user can contribute his or her computer as a caching node by
running a special video caching software client we are developing. The video caching software
is responsible for choosing the upstream node, and relaying the video stream to the
downstream nodes. This is similar to traditional P2P file sharing systems like BitTorrent, but
with an important extra constraint on latency due to the real-time nature of live streaming.
Rather than sending chunks of a file out-of-order as in P2P file sharing systems, more urgent
high-priority packets will be sent first. Furthermore, to minimize re-buffering, each caching
node may cache the entire video file instead of storing only a portion of a file as P2P file sharing
systems do.

For ease of explanation, the viewer nodes and the caching nodes are drawn as separated
nodes in Figure 3. However, it is worth pointing out that in practice, a user can run both the
caching software and viewer software on the same computer.

Figure 3 Right shows the Theta Network architecture for video on demand. Compared to live
streaming, the only difference is that the influencers (aka content creators) upload the source

GUID = QuadtreeRegionID || RandomBitsP ostfix

The GUID is the concatenation of two parts. The first part is the QuadtreeRegionID, a 64 bit
long string that encodes the geographical region of the caching node. The Quadtree data
structure is employed as the spatial index. The second part is a 32 bit random bit postfix to
differentiate caching nodes in the same quadtree region. This way the XOR of two GUIDs is a
rough estimation of the geographical distance between two nodes. Thus a new node can first
collect a list of candidate peer nodes with small GUID XOR distances. Then, it can send a ping
request to the candidates to measure the actual round trip time.

Bootstrapping The Network

The above discussion assumes a fully decentralized architecture where all the ingest and
caching nodes come from users. To realize this long term vision, we need a sufficient number
of users to participate, which may take some time. To bootstrap the network, we propose a
hybrid architecture that works with the existing CDN networks and the decentralized caching
nodes.

Traditional CDN Hybrid Architecture

Figure 4. Left - Traditional CDN, where all the viewers connect directly to the POP servers. For nodes geographically
far away from the POP servers, the stream quality may be lower (the dashed connections). Right - Hybrid
Architecture where viewer nodes can pull stream from caching nodes that are geographically closer than the POP
servers, resulting in better streaming quality.

Figure 4 illustrates the hybrid architecture and compares it with traditional CDN networks.
Whereas in the traditional CDN, every node pulls the stream directly from POP servers, in the
hybrid architecture, only a subset of nodes pull the stream from POP servers. Other nodes
simply pull the stream from their peer caching nodes which provide better and more effective
connection. The caching nodes thus augment the traditional CDN backbones with more caching
ayers for end viewers geographically far away from the POPs. We note that this hybrid
architecture applies to both video on demand and live streaming scenarios since traditional
CDN networks work similarly.

The advantage of bootstrapping with the hybrid architecture is important. The Theta network
is fully functional even with only a single caching node. Furthermore, as will be discussed
later, the caching node can earn Theta Tokens while providing the caching and video relaying
services. This provides strong economic incentives for more users to join the caching
network over time. As more user-contributed nodes join the Theta Network , the stream
delivery capability of the network improves. At the point when there are sufficient amount of
user contributed nodes, the network can run on its own without the traditional CDN backbone.
The Theta Blockchain

Overview

The Theta blockchain is based on a proof of stake (POS) consensus mechanism. PoS has the
advantage of lower computation costs and higher transaction throughput. In this model,
caching nodes and viewer clients don’t need to conduct hashing computations, which lessens
computational resource waste. Nonetheless, this approach has an important impact on the
Theta protocol design, especially on the bandwidth sharing reward scheme.

Separation of the Validator and Cacher Role

To further reduce the computational burden of the caching nodes, the role of validator and
cacher are separated. Validators are dedicated nodes for verifying transactions and assembling
new blocks. With such separation, caching nodes and viewers don't need to perform extra
computations aside from the usual video stream encoding/decoding tasks, as they would ina
POW scenario. This enables a wide range of edge devices (e.g. personal computers, mobile
devices, loT devices) to operate as caching nodes and viewers.

Scalability

Support for high transaction throughput is a must for a video streaming focused blockchain.
magine a scenario where alive streaming event could generate numerous token transactions
or caching node rewards in a short amount of time. Further examples include virtual gifting,
where a shoutout from a popular streamer can lead to a surge in token donations, possibly
housands of transactions per second. ERC-20 implementations simply cannot support this
level of performance — this is our view, which has also been echoed by many other projects.

Fortunately, for many streaming use cases, the transactions are independent of each other.
This unique characteristic makes techniques like sharding very appealing. Proper sharding could
potentially execute all the independent transactions in parallel, thus greatly increasing network
hroughput. Sharding also reduces the data storage requirement for the validators since a
validator only needs to work on one shard at a time.

Further, many of the token transactions are recurring (e.g. a viewer might make many micro
oken transactions to the same upstream caching node).

We developed a novel way to support high volumes of transactions through a Resource
Oriented Micropayment Pool.

Resource Oriented Micropayment Pool

One of the biggest challenges we identified when designing the Theta protocol is how to scale
our native chain for ultra high transaction throughput. Although many blockchain projects are
facing scaling problems, scaling for live video streaming is different and possibly even more

13
complex. Existing level two scaling solutions like payment channels have various disadvantages
when applied to the video streaming. We have designed and implemented an off-chain

ed. To create the pool, Alice needs to specify the “Resource

Step 3. Off-chain micropayments: Alice signs ServicePayment transactions and sends
them to the peers off-chain in exchange for parts of the specified resource (e.g. a piece

Step 4. On-chain settlement: Any peer (i.e. Bob, Carol, or David, etc) that received the
ServicePayment transactions from Alice can publish the signed transactions to the
blockchain anytime before the timelock expires to withdraw the tokens. We call the
ServicePayment transactions that are published the “on-chain settlement”
transactions.

Note that the recipient peers needs to pay for the gas fee for the on-chain settlement
transaction. To pay less transaction fees, they would have the incentive to publish
on-chain settlements only when necessary, which is beneficial to the scalability of the
network.

We note that no on-chain transaction is needed when Alice switches from one peer to another
to retrieve the resource. In the video streaming context, this means the viewer can switch to
any caching node at any time without making an on-chain transaction that could potentially
block or delay the video stream delivery. As shown in the figure, in the event that Bob leaves,
Alice can switch to Carol after receiving k chunks from Bob, and keep receiving video segments
without an on-chain transaction.

Moreover, the total amount of tokens needed to create the micropayment pool is (collateral +
deposit), which can be as low as twice of the value of the requested resource, no matter how
many peers Alice retrieves the resource from. Using computational complexity language, the
amount of reserved token reduces from O(n) to O(1) compared to the unidirectional payment
channel approach, where nis the number of peers Alice retrieves the resource from.

Double Spending Detection and Penalty Analysis

To prevent Alice, the creator of the micropayment pool from double spending, we need to 1) be

a)

able to detect double spending, and 2) ensure that the net value Alice gains from double
pending is strictly negative.

Detecting double spending is relatively straightforward. The validators of the Theta Network
check every on-chain transaction. If a remaining deposit in the micropayment pool cannot
cover the next consolidated payment transaction signed by both Alice and another peer, the
validators will consider that Alice has conducted a double spend.

ext, we need to make Alice worse off if she double spends. This is where the collateral comes

in. Earlier, we mentioned that the amount of collateral tokens has to be larger than the deposit.
And here is why.

Figure 6. Malicious Actor Detection and Penalty shows malicious actor Alice attempting to make a double spend and the
resulting penalty she receives

In the diagram above, Bob, Carol, and David are honest. Alice is malicious. Even worse, she
colludes with another malicious peer Edward. Alice exchanges partially signed transactions
with Bob, Carol, and David for the specified resource. Since Alice gains no extra value for the
duplicated resource, the maximum value she gets from Bob, Carol, and David is at most the
deposit amount. As Alice colludes with Edward, she can send Edward the full deposit amount.
She then asks Edward to commit the settlement transaction before anyone else and return her
the deposit later. In other words, Alice gets the resource which is worth at most the deposit
amount for free, before the double spending is detected. Later when Bob, Carol, or David
commit the settlement transaction, the double spending is detected, and the full collateral
amount will be slashed. Hence, the net return for Alice is

N€tjjco = deposit - collateral

Therefore, we can conclude that for this scenario, as long as collateral > deposit, Alice's net
return is negative. Hence, if Alice is rational, she would not have any incentive to double spend.

We can conduct similar analysis for other cases. The details are omitted here, but it can be
shown that in all cases Alice’s net return is always negative if she conducts a double spend.

Another case is that Alice is honest, but some of her peers are malicious. After Alice sends a
micropayment to one of those peers, it might not return Alice the resource she wants. In this
case, Alice can turn to another peer to get the resource. Since each incremental micropayment
can be infinitesimally small in theory, Alice’s loss can be made arbitrarily small.

Proof of Engagement

The “Resource Oriented Micropayment Pool" described can actually be leveraged to track the
delivery of the video segments to the end viewers, since each payment for the video segment
is associated with the ID of the video (i.e. the resource ID). This indicates that the
micropayments recorded in the blockchain reflect the viewing activity of the end viewers. Thus
he micropayment records can be used as the "Proof-of-Engagement (PoE)”.

With PoE, viewers can earn tokens as rewards from advertisers in exchange for their attention
0 video streams and by providing PoE. PoE not only brings benefits to viewers, but also to
advertisers as it provides them with a reliable and verifiable engagement measurement of the
delivered video streams. PoE can also be used as a basis to reward the content creators, which
could be done automatically by the validators of the Theta blockchain since PoE can be inferred
rom the transaction records.

Applications of Micropayment Pool Beyond Video Streaming

In the above discussion, we have presented the resource oriented micropayment pool concept
in the video delivery context. It is worth pointing out that it can be used in other applications as
well, as long as we can identify a resource where a user can gain no extra value when he
obtains multiple copies of the resource from different peers. Here are a few examples:

1) Aresource can be a generic file. So the resource oriented micropayment pool can
facilitate generic file sharing/storage.

2) Inthe context of app distribution (e.g. Apple AppStore, GooglePlay), an app can be
considered as a resource.

3) Aresource can be a certain type of service. E.g. file compression service, video
transcoding service, solving a set of linear equations, etc. For these services, the
requester gains no extra value by getting the same service from two vendors.

Smart Streaming Contracts

The Theta blockchain supports a set of specialized smart contracts which are novel and can be
utilized to implement several scenarios which will help facilitate reward collection and
distribution between various players in a distributed streaming and entertainment ecosystem.

Incentive Contract

The Theta blockchain supports a specialized smart contract called incentive contract. An
incentive contract is designed for several use cases which may involve a large number o
different parties. Rather than require complex application logic, this smart-contract simplifies
the process of collecting and distributing tokens based on certain pre-defined criteria and
allocations across different parties, some of whom may not be identified until later.

We believe the Incentive contract is a novel concept which will have many uses, including bu
not limited to:

e Advertisers rewarding viewers and streamers. In this case, the incentive contrac
serves as a way to deposit tokens in a decentralized advertising network, which are
drawn upon by various parties as the advertisements are shown and watched. The
tokens get spread across multiple parties, including one or more streamers, and any
number of viewers (ranging from a few thousand to as high as a few million), based
upon proof of engagement. The streamers may be identified at the start, or they may
be added later. The allocation may be specified based on percentages (for example,
50% to streamers and 50% to viewers) or other ways, and the contract is depleted over
time based on viewership, etc.

e Viewers can gift rewards to multiple parts of the streaming chain. An incentive
contract filled by a viewer for a specific streamer can also benefit the ingest nodes and
caching nodes that brought the stream to a specific viewer.

e Gift contract for multiple streamers. A viewer may want to gift tokens as they are
earned to multiple streamers. An incentive contract can be used to set up these gifts,
which can be allocated across multiple parties.

e Paid/Premium video content. The concept of an incentive contract can be used to
support paid/premium content in the network in the future. See “Future Work" section.
To watch paid content, a viewer must put tokens into an incentive contract, which gets
split based upon pre-defined allocations with the content owner (who may or may not
be streaming it).

e Subscriptions and Decentralized Entertainment Networks. Incentive contracts can
enabled premium services like a Netflix, Amazon Prime or Hulu to be built on top of our
decentralized video streaming network. Viewers can subscribe by allocating tokens
into incentive contracts which get parsed out between the many content owners in
the network and the streaming/bandwidth providers who enable the network.

e A cacher can share caching rewards with viewers and with content streamers. A
caching node can put a percentage of their rewards, their earned tokens, into an

19
incentive contract and these can be distributed to the streamers who own the content
they are streaming or share caching rewards with viewers.

These smart contracts are executed by the validators. Typically, in order for a recipient to
receive the payment, it needs to send a certain proof to the smart contract. Upon proof
validation, the smart contract initiates the token reward, and the original funders of the
incentive contract do not need to be involved.

Figure 7. Incentive contract examples

One of these smart-contracts, the live stream watching reward, which allows the advertisers
to reach the end viewers directly, is expanded below. To claim live stream watching reward, an
end viewer needs to supply the smart contract with the Proof-of-Engagement which will be
discussed below in detail.

Future Work

In this whitepaper, we introduced the Theta protocol, a new blockchain and token as the
incentive mechanism for a decentralized video streaming network. The Theta Network
encourages viewers to share their computing and bandwidth resources and solves a number of
technical and business challenges. The launch of the native Theta Network is planned for late
2018.

In the initial phase, we have assumed the video and livestream to be ad-supported free

content. The next phase of our research will provide support for premium paid content, piracy
issues and anti-piracy mechanisms in a trustless environment.

20
There are many other technical aspects of the protocol and network which we classify as
future work, beyond the initial launch of the native Theta Network:

e Shared Caching Rewards. Smart Contracts in the form of incentive contracts can be
used to distribute caching rewards between different parties. This would allow certain
servers to incentivize end viewers to watch their stream, separate from advertiser's
rewards for viewers, and to reward streamers for providing their content to the
cacher.

e = Anti-Piracy. The network can be expanded to include anti-piracy - since tokens may
be used to stream and cache certain content, the tokens serve as a “dis-incentive”
within the network as the content can be tagged as required tokens or “premium
content”.

e General Purpose Service Platform. The Theta protocol is in fact independent of
streaming. It can be extended to handle other types of service to allow end users to
receive service for free. Another interesting extension is to support more general types
of smart contracts in addition to the smart streaming contracts. In the extreme case,
the smart contracts supported could be Turing complete similar to the Ethereum
Smart Contract'!. This could enable DApps built on top the Theta blockchain to issue
their own tokens.

Abstract

Deeply integrating blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT)
technologies, Cyber-Physical Chain (CPChain) builds new
generation distributed IoT system architecture with decentralized and
trustworthy characteristic. CPChain aims to reduce the cost of system
connectivity, increase the value of open data sharing and ensure user
privacy and system security for IoT.

CPChain focuses on the scalability, security and real-time
problems of the application of blockchain technology to the IoT
industry. Combining the three technologies of blockchain, IoT and
distributed encryption storage and computing, CPChain construct a
new generation of IoT architecture, which provides a full process
solution for data acquisition, storage, sharing and application in the
IoT industry.

CPChain is focused on multiparty data transactions and artificial
intelligence decision applications based on big data analysis. By
establishing multi-party trust and realizing the interconnection of
heterogeneous data, it solves the typical problem in traditional IoT
industry. Furthermore, we can create an innovative business model

for new generation of data sharing on CPChain.
Existing IoT bottleneck problems

1. Cost. The centralization characteristics of
the current IoT system causes the problem
of poor interoperability and high

interconnection cost among devices and IT

systems.

2. Isolability. The traditional IoT architecture . tg

is a proprietary structure for specific ae

application scenarios, which is likely to
result in isolated data island. Moreover, the

data value cannot be fully utilized.

3. Privacy and Security. Privacy leakage and
cyber attack are frequent reported recently on Data
IoT, which shows that users’ privacy data and

system security are not well protected.

CPChain will overcome the bottleneck problems in the
current IoT system by considering four critical technologies,
which include distributed cloud storage, data _ security
cryptography, blockchain technology, and large-scale distributed

network consensus protocol.

1. A decentralized system is built by integrating with
blockchain technology to guarantee that the data on the chain

is permanently valid and  untamper-proof. It provides
verifiability and traceability for various IoT application.

.A novel technology of combing cryptography and
distributed hash table (DHT) is proposed to solve the
scalability problem of the data storage in traditional blockchain.
. Ahighly efficient distributed consensus protocol is designed
to encourage users participation and promote the cooperation
of all parties involved in the system.

. Both  re-encryption and homomorphic — encryption
technologies are implemented to guarantee the operation of
the system, protect users’ privacy data, and further enhance the

confidence of users.

CPChain provides a basic data platform, by which different
industrial IoT systems are effectively connected and different
industry data can be intelligently interacted. Taking the traffic data
as an example, CPChain provides a comprehensive process solution

for optimization of traffic scheduling, customization of vehicle’s
personalized insurance, routing optimization of vehicle navigation

and driving assistance, etc.:

In terms of the IoT-data-based artificial intelligent decisions,
taking electric vehicles as an example, the CPChain data platform can
obtain sensors data of all kinds of key equipment of electric vehicles
and battery charging/discharging to _ realize the predictive
maintenance of electric vehicles. Moreover, combining with travel
data and charging pile data, CPChain can establish a shared travel and
charging platform for electric vehicles, which enables our green and

economic travel.

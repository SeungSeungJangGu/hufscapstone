In the Korean market, the online booking service ‘Yanolja’ has secured KRW 212.2 billion investment from
the Singapore investment agency ‘Booking Holdings’ in June 2019, and the company made a Unicorn
corporation with a corporate value of $1 billion (KRW 1.1 trillion).

‘Yanolja’, with the sales of KRW 20 billion in 2014, in 2018 the company reached the sales of KRW 161.6
billion. After the investment securement in 2019, the company is integrating the travel and hospitality
related service platform through M&A of the third-largest reservation app ‘Dailyhotel’, the leading room
management system company ‘Garam’ and ‘Seereal’ and ‘ez-technosis’, the global hotel system company
in India.

‘GoodChoice’ (YegiUtae) is another prominent company in the same field has secured KRW 300 billion in
cash by selling its equity to the British private equity fund, CVC Capital, and recorded sales of KRW 68.6
billion in 2018, acquired growth rate at 200% over the past two years.

As seen above, the international and domestic online booking service in the travel and hospitality industry
is continuously expanding the business size.

The business expansion in the travel and hospitality industry is closely connected with the latest trend.
The increase of GNP has increased the economic affordability and implemented the aware-ness of the
importance of personal life. Such a phenomenon has shed light on the maintenance of work-life balance,
spread on the idea of YOLO (You Only Live Once), increased numbers of younger generations of digital
nomads. Based on such a tendency, the travel and hospitality industry will constantly grow its business
size, and the importance of relatable platforms is escalated.

ROONEX aims to create an affluent society by composing the ecosystem based on the platform of the
travel and hospitality industry applied with the block-chain.

The Problem

To revitalize the industry and to enhance the service efficiency in the travel and hospitality industry,
multifarious preparation and continuous efforts in many different fields are required. Large hotels are
maximizing the overall efficiency by effectively deploying the human resource based on the capital,
material resources. Business hotels and small and medium-sized hospitality businesses are facing
hardships in effective operation due to lack of professional human resources, marketing budget,
operation skills, IT resources.

Also, there exist problems occurring from diverse perspectives besides the explosion of the global online
reservation market.

The conflict on the ownership of and sharing of sales of hotel packages, the securement of reliability on
up-to-date data, excessive commission rate on the sales, assurance on the safeness of the purchase and
definite delivery, limitation on the means of payments are the following problems. Products must be
reliably disclosed to the consumers and the consumer’s contract must also be guaranteed to remain un-
amended. Transactions during the release of product disclosure and contract process require equivalent
reliability. If reliable information on the selling products is provided to the consumers and ensure safe
purchase contract and transparency in transactions, the future business prosperity is possible.

O2 Project Description

1) Project Introduction

ROONEX aims to build an integrated platform that can span both internally and externally while expanding IT
operational platform targeted small to medium-sized businesses, and effectively managing the transaction
flow. In the process, it is feasible to increase the safety and reliability of operations and transactions by
expanding the SaaS-based operational platform, securing blockchain-based transactions, ensuring reliability
through smart-contract and making improvements on the limitation on the payment methods.

Despite the globally open network infrastructure, the interconnection of networks and platforms is a
remaining difficulty, along with the process beyond the regions and industries. This project aims to create an
environment where high-quality information can be shared by completing the individual platforms and
increasing the interconnectivity between the participating platforms. The platform will link providers and
users, brokers to create an autonomous trading ecosystem and expand itself to other industries to maximize
the benefit returned to the participants. We hope to build a project that generates benefits to the
participants by establishing a service applied with block-chain technology based on a platform that connects
service providers and users in the travel and hospitality industry.

(Steps of project establishment)

Step 1: Expansion of IT operational platform in the international small and medium-sized hotels and
hospitality facilities

Step 2: Secure transparency in sharing information and transaction between platforms and provide
convenient payment methods

Step 3: Support an organic connection with other industrial platforms

As the accommodation and travel industries expanded rapidly, it became increasingly important to effectively
provide a variety of service platforms using IT technology, and problems such as lower confidence in the large
amount of data produced, monopoly of the data, the limitations of payment methods, etc. are regarded as
major factors that hinder the development of the industry. Therefore, creating a platform that benefits both
service providers and users is really needed through disclosure of reliable data, transparency of transactions,
application of global payment methods, etc. based on the application of block-chain to the existing process.
There is a great need to build an advanced platform combined with block-chain based on the existing
technology and know-how, and humanity will be able to have an enriching life more and more through such
blockchain-oriented collaborations.

The following is the description of the operating system on the foundation of the ROONEX platform.

To manage the hotel business, similar to the generic industry, diverse business functions are employed.
Business planning, financing, managing infrastructure, operational manual, various transactions with
consumers and parterres, human resources and accounting management; these may vary depending on the
industry but on the fundamental level, these must be performed with equally important proportion. HIS
(Hotel Information System) enhances the efficiency of these major business functions. In the hotel industry,
hotel informative system is known as PMS, property management system. It encompasses the system that
manages all assets of hotels including the human resources and material resources. In Korea, it is generalized
in terms of the hotel information system or hospitality operational system. PMS serves a comprehensive
management system that provides various functions required in running the business.

(Operational purpose on hotel information system)

= secure operation perforation continuity through the process

= Cost reduction through efficient customer responsiveness and service expansion
= Offer information when the manager requires it

= Offer information for supervising the operation and adjustment

The hotel information system is distinguished in front-office and back-office. The front-office deals with
customer relations and management, and the back-office deals with personnel, payment, re-sources, finance
and overall management tasks.

2. Direct-booking
2-1) Overview

From the CRM perspective, the hotel constantly considers how to continuously and effectively manage
inflowing consumers from various external channels.

‘Direct Booking’ is the notable service where the users can make a room reservation on the website
personally.

The online market has been active since the 2010s, most of the hotel accepted bookings over the phone calls
and listed phone numbers on the hotel website for the reservation. To market cost reduction and online
activation, businesses began to apply direct booking service since 2016. The website was equipped with room
booking function and reservation management function and started direct marketing.

Marketing costs include the opportunity cost due to the failure of making bookings for consumers accessing
the website, reduction of commission fees on the booking website, increased consumer loyalty from the
direct management, increased rate of reentering consumers with the mileage. De-spite the room availability,
due to the time difference when the data is provided, the non-reservable state from the lack of sellable blocks
provided by the sellers is a very crucial factor to be considered. For these various reasons, hotels are
increasingly interested in ‘direct booking’.

3. Self Check-in KIOSK

3-1) Overview

The KIOSK is literally the electronic shopping terminal installed in small shops or other kinds of shops. It means
a vending machine or simplified equipment for guidance purposes in Korea. The KIOSK is currently in use at
many locations, including the above-mentioned airports and parking lots and so on, and as it has been widely
used especially for the food service industry in recent years, it is becoming more and more common around
us.

The KIOSK has long been used in the hotel industry, but, in fact, it has been used for limited purposes such as
selling vacant rooms without front-desk staffs at night time or protecting guest privacy, etc. The beginning of
unmanned check-in services begins with a vending machine, a very common service in the accommodation
industry. Travelers were able to purchase daily necessities such as a toothbrush, a toothpaste, etc. from
vending machines at the accommodation. The function of unmanned room sales began with the idea of
expanding vending machines, which made it available for guests to select and purchase rooms available for
sale. The KIOSK for unmanned check-in services should be reviewed in the following three aspects: (1) service
unctions, (2) room key issuance methods, and (3) operational options.

The workplace using ‘check-in KIOSK’ can have the following effects.

* Reduced check-in and check-out time at specific times when guests are crowded

4. Digital Payment

4-1) Overview

The value of money can be determined not by its size, shape or location, but by ‘recognition’, that is, ‘trust’
between traders. The fact that the point of a particular company has a relatively high value or that a virtual
currency without any entity like ‘Bitcoin’ is highly valued is created by the ‘trust’ market participants. As IT
equipment and services evolve with ‘trust’ among participants, the ‘digital payment’ is spreading very fast.

It can be classified into several perspectives as below considering the variety of means of payment and service
methods.

* Online payment: It means all online payment services including payment by debit or credit card, the
services of a particular bank or card company, etc.

* Point: Combined points such as OK Cashback, Happy Point, etc. and points dedicated to specific shopping
malls, delivery applications, and homepages

* Simple payment: Payment services based on the connection of specific means of payment, including credit
cards, etc., or bank services, such as PayPal, ZeroPay, Bank Wallet, Samsung Pay, LG Pay, Pay Now, T Pay,
BC Pay, Just Touch, 11 Pay, Naver Pay, Kakao Pay, PAYCO, Smile Pay, SSG Pay, Toss, WeChat, Ali Pay, etc.

* Mobile payment: A payment service available via mobile phones

* Digital coin: A payment method that can be used for payment and that value changes from time to time
like ‘Bitcoin’ (It is likely to be a point-like digital currency when the value stabilizes in the future.)

* CPS (Chinese Pay Service): WeChat Pay and Ali Pay for Chinese people have been classified separately.

5. Software as a Service
5-1) Overview

ASP (Application service Provider) refers to an application software rent service. It is a method in which
applications or installable software provided on the web can be used by a rent agreement. As there has been
a growing interest in improving productivity through IT and software with the development of internet speed
and the spread of smartphones since 2010, the needs of different types of software have increased for small
and medium-sized businesses and small workplaces. It was SaaS(Software as a Service) that appeared at the
time. It is similar in terms of a rental system, but it is the core point that users rent and use the software and
pay for it according to usage based on cloud computing. In particular, it has the advantage that users can use
it according to their own environment by providing packages with various options or menus.

In a hotel or small-scale accommodation, various operation-related software is being used to operate the
workplace in addition to the above-mentioned software, such as an e-mail, a word processor, etc. Basically, it
targets the hotel operation system and channel sales system, and you will need to use software for guest
management, marketing, and analysis-related software, including direct booking and online payment
according to the management policy of the workplace. Of the software, the advantage of the service provided
based on SaaS is that users can directly determine user environments through a combination of various
options in the package. For the SaaS service, it can be used by either a simple off-line contract or a direct
configuration of users after signing up online.

During the time when the SaaS concept didn’t exist, everyone prepared a server or a desktop, purchased and
installed the software, and then used it. Under the circumstance, using features optimized for the size and
characteristics of the workplace and increasing the cost-effectiveness of the software were challenging. There
were many cases that a workplace with 50 rooms and another workplace with 150 rooms paid for the same
expenses, despite differences in size. As cloud computing spreads and the SaaS concept is common, it is being
changed in such a way that users only pay for expenses depending on the class of service after they are
offered the level of service they want. They just need to pay for the expenses considering system usage that
increases in proportion to the number of rooms, data storage space, the number of functions in use and the
interlocked systems, etc.

The establishment of the SaaS platform using global cloud services such as AWS, MS-AZURE, etc. with the
spread of the SaaS concept have made it possible to provide a faster and more effective service.

6. Booking Engine

6-1) Overview and Status

‘Booking engine’ refers to a portal for the sale of hotel rooms, etc. It is a kind of the service system of Online
Travel Agency(OTA) such as Booking.com, Interpark, Yanolja, etc. In the booking engine, various marketing
channels should also be operated to appeal to the users with basic functions such as efficient product
management, fast access, the application of various methods of calculating charges, etc. Therefore, high
operating costs are required, resulting in having to maintain a high sales-commission.

ROONEX is planning to build an efficient reservation service platform for domestic and foreign low and middle
priced accommodations. It is about building a reservation platform for actual room guests by sharing
information about guests using the hotel operating system platform. Assuming 50% of the currently available
10,000 rooms are targeted, 150,000 (5,000 * 30) guests a month and 1.8 million guests a year are targeted.
Considering domestic and overseas customer sites that will increase in the future, it will be able to do
marketing for even more guests.

Information on room products sold is processed in the form of reliable data on block-chain and then is open
to the public. In addition, the product purchase contract is recorded in the block-chain and distributed ledger,
so that reliability is guaranteed for that purchase. This will create a reservation platform that will benefit both
the accommodations and their users.

7. FIT MY TRAVEL

7-1) Overview and Status

This platform was first started to increase the value and utility of the booking engine. It is to provide travel
products and content suitable for each customer who reserves the accommodation. However, this will have a
tendency of not just a website that simply offer content but a portal integrating booking, accommodations,
and other services in terms of product purchasers on the platform. The portal will make it available for
customers to perform everything related to travel, accommodations, etc. on the platform.

The discovery of new payment methods is important in the process.

ABC-SYSTEM aims to solve the difficulties caused by payment processes, such as a payment problem with
global credit cards when purchasing a product, fees paid to payment agencies, restrictions on payments with
holding currencies and so on, through coins.

Simply, it is to integrate the means of payment for various domestic and foreign products into one through
linkage with alliance platforms along with the purchase of reservation products, payment of room rates, and
points provided to guests.

8. Data Science
8-1) Extension for data science

ABC-SYSTEM is preparing a project that creates a new value by collecting and analyzing meaningful data
generated while communicating with a variety of customers and proceeding with an efficient service through
the ‘FIT MY TRAVEL’ portal.

It includes, of course, analyzing customer trends and providing them with a new value, but we have an idea of
primarily supporting the setting of the best room rate from the perspective of the provider. Providers should
set a profitable room rate, taking into account market conditions and their relationships with competitors, but
the reality is that they have to rely only on their senses. The accommodation operation platform ‘FIT MY
TRAVEL’ finds the best price for customers based on existing data through the mutual interlocking of
platforms. It aims to provide profitable products to customers in the best possible conditions by automatically
setting a sale price in real time through linkage with the set data and the accommodation operation platform.

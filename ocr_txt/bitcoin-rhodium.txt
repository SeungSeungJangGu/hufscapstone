Bitcoin Rhodium is a community-based crypto

commodity, rare, limited and resistant crypto

asset to store value for the future.

Bitcoin Rhodium is a unique crypto commodity with limited

supply and strong use case . Its store-of-value qualities are

further supported by a set of features that meet the demand

for a long-term crypto investment, incentivize strong-hand

investor behaviour and bridge the gap between the world of
crypto and traditional investment.

hat without a viable, long-term use-case - that could
a Ca communicated to investors - the odds of significant price
oe appreciation were extremely low.

First, we considered what other altcoins were doing - and then, what
Bitcoin couldn't do, given its ability to subsume nearly all vital crypto
asset functions. Which is when we came up with the idea of “ultra-Bitcoin
scarcity”; i.e., a coin with all of Bitcoin's best features, and a lifetime
cap of just 2.1 million, or one-tenth of Bitcoin’s; of which, roughly half would
trade upon launch, with the other half to be mined by the public over the
next 100 years. Additionally, we added a privacy feature, in our quest to
create a crypto asset that would cater to large, long-term holders.

Next, we determined that the best way to build community was to distribute
Our coin, Bitcoin Rhodium - named for the relatively unknown; and by far,
~$carcest Precious Metal - via an “airdrop” to existing Bitcoin holders.
By aifdrop, we mean that unlike hard forks, there is no requirement for
a third party to split and/or store the coin. Instead, proactive Bitcoin
holders could claim BTR by “registering” non-zero balance public Bitcoin
addresses from online and offline wallets in which they held their own
private keys - like online Electrums or offline Trezors and Ledgers.
By “signing” the unique message supplied by Bitcoin Rhodium, one could
prove Bitcoin ownership without givifig out thelr private keys thus, enabling
the receipt of FREE Bitcoin Rhodium in the subsequent. elagming. pi piotess
in one's perepnal online Bitcoin Rhodium wallet. ° a aaa

Finally, we aineth to create a “community” to tastel ora term: ae
through the me = room that we, the development team;. actively Ne

monitor in a de f sustomer service” function - ‘ particularly during”
the airdrop process, which started in December, and will end March 31st.
Through Discord, Twitter, and Reddit, we believe awareness of Bitcoin
Rhodium's “ultra-Bitcoin scarcity” use case has.increased, to the point that ~
we expect the launch, currently scheduled for late summer, to be met with |
significant investor enthusiasm.

Ultimately, in the words of one of the project's most well-known public
supporters, we hope Bitcoin Rhodium will be viewed as “Elite Bitcoin: to be
BRODLed as passionately as Bitcoin is HODLed.

October 22, 2018 - Bitcoin Rhodium’s development team announced that,

after a year of exhaustive work, the Bitcoin Rhodium (BTR) MainNet was
launched this weekend.

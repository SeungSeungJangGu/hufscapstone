Motivation

Blockchain and cryptocurrency news have become
more familiar to people, but it’s still difficult to get into
these fancy things, even for software developers.

Most blockchain projects focus on the distribution
factors and secure key management. However these all
lead to slow transactions, private keys loss and difficult
understanding. And it's nearly impossible to deploy
these distributed nodes on mobile devices, the most
popular computing devices.

Despite their effort on the distribution dream, we have
noticed the reality that even the most distributed
blockchain consensus algorithm leads to the control of
several large pools. Consider the BCH hard fork to BTC.

Some popular blockchain projects have or plan to
choose some not so distributed consensus algorithms
by design, Ethereum is migrating to PoS and EOS is
implementing DPoS. This effort may improve the
transaction throughput, but that’s all.

Still, people have to manage fancy private keys and
lose them, pools and whale nodes will fork the network
endlessly without effort, developers try their best effort
to develop some new tokens, and people have no
proper way to use the nodes on their mobile devices.

Design

Mixin is an effort to find a balance in distributed
network and traditional server clusters, make some
tradeoffs to combine the pros of the two together.

¢ Limited and trusted full nodes with guaranteed data

transparency and consistency.

e Zero-knowledge proof and free transactions with high

throughput and low latency.

¢ Inter-blockchain communication protocol to connect all

popular blockchain networks.

* Non-deterministic transactions and interact directly

with trusted external sources.

e Phone number and PIN based account model for easy

mobile use.

* Secure and end-to-end encrypted messaging channel

to reach every account for notifications.

¢ Developer friendly to facilitate all Linux libraries and

programming languages.

¢ The largest mobile blockchain network effect should

prevent forks.

To accomplish these goals, we designed an unique
blockchain model that relies on Trusted Execution
Environment technology and relationship, while the
consensus algorithm mainly acts as the guarantee for
data replication, and the mobile nodes will acts as
validators to do runtime attestation of the full nodes.

Mixin Network

Full Nodes in Trusted Execution Environment

As illustrated in the figure above, the fundamental of
Mixin network is some trusted full nodes run in the
Trusted Execution Environment.

All Mixin full nodes are fully trusted because they can
verify the identity of all other full nodes and validate
the code they run through TEE attestation at runtime.

Mixin full nodes accept transactions and participate in
the network's consensus algorithm. Due to the code
validation, only one node should execute DApp code to
achieve high throughput and low latency.

All sensitive components of the network must run
inside the Trusted Execution Environment and are
responsible for protecting security and privacy, for
maintaining data transparency and consistency.

End-to-End Encryption
Messaging

Mixin uses the sender key of Signal protocol to manage
all conversations, despite direct message or group
chat.

The protocol is client based, so the server only acts as
a proxy of the messages, and due to the strong end-
to-end encryption feature, no one could inspect
anything from the proxied messages, even the Mixin
full nodes.

All messages will be permanently deleted on the
servers once read by all the recipients in the
conversation.

Photos, videos and all other attachments are also
encrypted with random AES key before uploading to
our cloud storage. Then the client will transfer all the
meta information, such as thumbnail, AES key to the
recipient with Signal sender key encryption.

As Mixin is using the mature Signal protocol and open
source library as the messaging protocol, we won't dig
into the technical details of the specification in this
white paper.

Mobile and PIN Based
Identity

The obstacle that prevents people from using
blockchain is not the performance, it's the identity or
account management procedure.

All popular blockchain networks require people to
obtain and manage at least one private key to keep an
identity. This is too complicated, it's not a bit but
hundreds of times more complicated compared to
username and password solution.

As all existing blockchain data are open to the world, to
use an username and password solution, people are
still required to manage a complicated password to
keep account secure, think about BTS or EOS.

Thanks to the zero-knowledge and secure execution
environment in the Mixin network, we are able to
design a much simpler identity solution that's based on
phone verification code and PIN.

People just need a phone number and remember a six
digit PIN to keep an identity, even easier than username
password solution, without complicated private key but
comparable security level.

While the phone number verification process to
transfer private keys ensure easy phone migration, the
6-digit PIN can be replaced by Touch ID or Face ID on
supported mobile phones, this improves the user
experience to another level.

A typical BTC transaction should take as long as one
hour to confirm, the fee is also too high to send micro-
payments. And the public blockchain data make
transaction privacy nearly impossible.

To overcome the Bitcoin problem, with the identity
procedure above, we designed a cross-chain
transaction network similar to the Bitcoin Lighting
Network or the Ethereum Raiden Network.

The underlying technique of Mixin PIN identity is still
private key management, but secured and made easy
by the Mixin zero-knowledge trusted execution
network. So it's feasible to treat this as a smart
contract like Lighting Network to manage BTC or any
other blockchain assets.

After assets from other blockchains come in to the
Mixin Network, whenever a Mixin user start a BTC
transaction to another user in Mixin, the server won't
do any real transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain,
instead it just managed their balance numbers in the
Mixin blockchain, which is as fast as general SQL
database operations.

XIN - The Token

XIN is the sole token used by many services in Mixin,
especially full node pledge, the DApp creation and API
calls.

To join the network as a full node, it should pledge at
least 10,000 XIN token to establish the initial trust.

Every DApp creation will cost some XIN for one time,
the cost is determined by the resources the DApp
claimed to consume.

The Mixin API calls from DApp will cost some XIN
depends on the call type and count.

All the XIN fees charged by platform will be burned to
increase the existing XIN tokens value.

This means normal users won't get charged to use the
service while only DApp developers are charged,
however, the DApp may charge users for its service.

1,000,000 permanent total XIN token is issued to the
world at one time, and to make the calculation easier,
the Mixin Messenger will mainly use milliXIN as the
main currency symbol. We abbreviate milliXIN as MIX,
that's the same thing as one thousandth XIN.

Conclusion

Mixin network has unlimited throughput, easy and
familiar account model for people, ability to connect
and use all currencies on any existing blockchain
networks.

Besides the underlying Mixin network, we are building
the Mixin Messenger as the first DApp and entrance to
it, all code are open sourced to give the developers an
overview of how to develop on Mixin.

Treat Mixin Network as the open Android ecosystem, all
existing blockchain networks as different phone
manufactures and countries, the Mixin Messenger acts
as the Google Play role to provide DApp discovery for
users, easy notifications and payments for developers.

With nearly 1,000,000 pre-registered users, Mixin
network welcome all developers to develop or port
their existing app to the platform, with familiar
development environment.

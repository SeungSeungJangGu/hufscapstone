Ontology is a blockchain/distributed ledger
network which combines a distributed identity
system, distributed data exchange, distributed data
collaboration, distributed procedure protocols,

distributed communities, distributed attestation, and

various industry-specific modules. Together this builds

the infrastructure for a peer-to-peer trust network

which is cross-chain, cross-system, cross-industry,

cross-application, and cross-device.
® The Three Dimensions of Trust

Trust is a key component in human organization and social
collaboration. Trust has become the core requirement

of social and economic partnership that has been built

up through technology, law, and community throughout

history.
Trust through Technology:

Building trust through technology is
seen as a promising area in today's
information society. Technologies like
cryptology, biological devices, and
big data are being used to build trust
across industries.

The introduction of blockchain
technology has brought trust to the
masses through shared access to
decentralized information. Blockchain
has not just built trust in individual
projects - it has fundamentally changed
the future of trust ecosystems.

Trust through Legal Systems:

Trust in legal systems is the oldest
and the most basic trust mechanism,
assuring rights and protections across

industries and across the world.

Economic systems, which are
inseparable from legal systems, are

a top choice for integration into
blockchain. This means a pairing of
economic and legal systems is needed
to address certain issues including:

The issue of legal authentication.
Due to the decentralized and
digitalized nature of blockchains,
comprehensive collaboration with
offline legal entities is needed.

The issue of legal support.
Support for sandbox experiments,
automated compliance, and
moderation are required for the

entire blockchain system.

The issue of identification.

PART |. TRUST SYSTEMS AND ONTOLOGY

Trust through Communities:

Trusting those close to us can be the
most natural form of trust. Sociologists
put the number of people we trust at
less than one hundred; it is intrinsically
difficult to build trust networks on

larger scales.

Since the era of informatization and
the internet, decentralized network
systems such as peer-to-peer networks
and blockchains have created online
communities much larger than
traditional communities. Based on
these there have been many attempts
to build new communities of trust,
such as Google PageRank, Pretty Good
Privacy, Web of Trust, as well as other
decentralized evaluation systems and

decentralized communities.

Blockchains need to better collabo-
rate with the world to build better

identity verification solutions.
PART I. TRUST SYSTEMS AND ONTOLOGY

HM Current Issues in Trust Networks

Although we now have a range of trust mechanisms we still

face many barriers in establishing trust including:

Fragmented sources of trust. When
data has to be verified by multiple
sources the process can become
time consuming, costly, and put data

security in jeopardy.

Missing role of the individual.
Individuals do not have enough say
in the use of their own data and
authentication of other data.

Emergence of new sources of trust.
With fragmented sources of trust
the overall cost of verification has
increased.

Data management monopolization.
Today’s data management systems
are monopolizing user data while
failing to compile useful and
accessible portfolios of data for

external use.

Data fragmentation. Due to frag-
mentation of databases, data which
is not monopolized loses out on
trading potential and can often not

be authenticated and used.

Inaccurate identity verification. Us-
ing a single information management
system makes it difficult to form
comprehensive identity portfolios.

Security issues in the Internet

of Things. Currently there are

not sufficient identity verification
mechanisms to prevent illegal and
malicious node access to the Internet
of Things.

Data exchange security issues.
Current data exchange systems are
centralized, which causes problems
such as loss of data origin and

threats to data security.

Trust issues in collaborative
systems. Without a central author-
ity it is difficult to form trust in

collaborative systems.

Transparency issues in equity
management. New equity manage-
ment models such as crowdfunding
find it hard to build trust due to lack

of transparency.

Weak community management.
Current community management
systems do not have sufficient
moderation tools.

Identifying false information. There
are not sufficient mechanisms to
identify, report, and remove false

information from online systems.

Weak reputation systems. Adequate
reputation systems require massive
data sets, however fragmentation

of data in current systems does not
make this possible.

Making charitable donations. It is
becoming more important to provide
high levels of transparency when
managing charity donations. Basic
transaction tracking can only solve
part of the problem; comprehensive
verification of organizations and
recipients is needed.

The variety of trust mechanisms at hand today have

indirectly become the weakness of today's trust systems.

Building a network which integrates the fragmented industry

is needed to build a true and complete trust system.
PART |. TRUST SYSTEMS AND ONTOLOGY

H Ontology's Ethos

Ontology has architected a distributed trust system. It
incorporates multiple trust types in an integrated protocol
system with various blockchains and databases. Multi-
source identities and multi-source data exchange protocols
have been implemented into the network, building a

distributed trust system that is cross-chain, cross-industry,

cross-system, cross-application, and cross-device.

Ontology aims to develop its trust ecosystem through
partnerships to provide distributed services including
distributed communities, data verification, data exchange,

and credit across industries.

PART |. TRUST SYSTEMS AND ONTOLOGY

HM Vision and Structure

Ontology’s Trust Network is a protocol network built with multiple

blockchains and systems to support use with all business types.

In order to meet the needs of different industries, the flexible

design structure is modularized, pluggable, and easily expandable.

Ontology applies blockchain technology to all business types,
providing blockchains, smart contracts, distributed verification
management, data exchange, and other protocols and APIs. Users
can easily develop distributed services through Ontology without

having previous knowledge of distributed networks.

Distributed Ledger Layer

ONT Core Ledger

NEO Ethereum Bitcoin

At Ontology’s foundation is a fully
decentralized ledger system that
includes smart contracts and
security protocols. Ontology provides
compatibility support for complex
technological systems, whether that
be existing blockchains or tradition
information systems. All systems feature
decentralized entity management with
support for main protocols and different
password standards.

9

Ontology also provides systems for
secure data storage, hardware options
for key management, and encrypted
data analysis. Together this creates
an application platform that allows
for all kinds of services to become

decentralized.

Ontology provides the framework
for use of all type of applications,

including decentralized data exchange

and procedure management protocols
through the use of APIs, SDKs, and
other modules.

@ Decentralized Identity Verification and

Multi-Factor Authentication

A decentralized and multi-factor identity verification system that assures data
privacy is core to building a trust network. Such a system can provide identity

verification systems for individuals, organizations, and physical objects.

M Delivering a Decentralized Trust System

In Ontology a decentralized trust system can be implemented alongside

traditional trust systems. This includes:

Community Trust Statement

Community trust is an effective system in which Astatement is the medium of community trust. In
communities and individuals play an active role in identity Ontology a statement is a confirmation passed from
verification. one entity to another; only one statement is needed to

instantly verify information.
Trust Anchor

Trust Transfer
A trust anchor is an entity that has been entrusted to

conduct identity verification. The higher the trust in the Trust transfer is conducted by submitting information

trust anchor, the higher the trust in the network. required and receiving a statement. This could be an
individual submitting their own identity information or
using previously submitted information to form a portfolio

of multiple identity certifications.

10
PART Il. ONTOLOGY TRUST NETWORK

M@ Distributed Ledger Technology

Ontology’s storage system works on a distributed ledger. The key feature

of the completely decentralized, tamper-proof ledger is that trust is

shared amongst multiple parties through the use of smart contracts,

distributed networks, distributed storage, distributed authority,

distributed security, and a variety of modules.

Entity Registration and Authorization

An identity registration and
authorization system can be built with
Ontology's adjustable configurations or
by using a third-party authentication
system such as CA Identity Manager.
Community authentication and industry-
specific verification methods can also be
used to allow participants access

to identity verification through

the blockchain.

Data Directory

Data can be registered categorically to
directories and use data identifiers
(ONT Data ID) and data resource
identifiers (Data URI) to match and
verify to requirements through the

decentralized system.

11

Procedure Protocols

Ontology’s procedure protocols are
carried out with distributed ledger
technology, cross-chain entities,
cross-system privacy, and cross-chain

protocols.

Data Exchange

All entities using Ontology can use the
data exchange. It allows users to have
full control of their data; having the
tools to trade it while being able to

meet their own privacy requirements.

Data Attestation

The distributed ledger system does not
only store data but also records its use.
Each data request, data matching, data
transfer, and data usage is attested to
the ledger, forming a complete private

record of the data use.

Smart Contracts

Businesses can grow by implementing
smart contracts and trust networks
through new procedure protocols,

controls, and exchanges of data.

M Other Key Functions and Modules

Ontology Crypto Package (OCP)

Ontology provides a series of
cryptography and data security module
support in areas including multi-factor
entity authentication, distributed data
exchange, and distributed procedure
protocols. This includes encrypted data
transfer, key sharing protocols, multi-
party key management, ring signature
modules, blind signature modules, and
secret sharing mechanisms. In identity
and data validation zero-knowledge
proof and homomorphic encryption
schemes are used, and in a collaborative
application two records are kept. Other
multi-party technology schemes are

being explored for the future.

13

Ontology Marketplace (OM)

Ontology Marketplace is a distributed
data exchange complete with data
sets, algorithms, and models. It acts
as an extension to Ontology, providing
data products, data predictions, and
data computing resources. At the same
time it maintains compatibility with
other major cross-chain systems to
create a large data exchange platform.
The native dApp lets providers across
industries implement the data trading

market.

GlobalDB

GlobalDB is a distributed key-

value storage. It provides multiple
backend database module options
including levelDB, RocksDB, TiDB, and
cockroachDB.

GlobalDB is a blockchain database and
IPFS module. GlobalDB provides the
ability for distributed transactions,
scalability, real time checking of the
blockchain, and ability to interact
with data off-chain. It can be used to
correlate the blockchain and data, the
blockchain and Al, and so on.
PART Il. ONTOLOGY TRUST NETWORK

Ontology will build further modules according to

project-specific requirements.

HydraDAO

HydraDAO is a data prediction and
interaction module integrating smart
contracts, cross-chain, and cross-

data source collaboration. It contains
Ontology’s DAO (distributed autonomous
organization) and cross-chain data
interaction (big data/Al) features.
Ontology’s governance mechanism
supports democratic and Al-automated
propositions and verifications. A unique
DAO address and polling token will

be created during the process, which
allows DAO to automatically add funds
and results to Ontology. Once polling

is complete, DAO will autonomously
execute in accordance with the tamper-
proof smart contract. The mechanism
allows data exchange and governance in
Ontology to function with flexibility and
supports the technology for large-scale

automated network operations.

Ortorand Consensus Engine

Certain distributed ledger networks
within Ontology’s chain network support
Ontorand Consensus Engine (OCE), a new
consensus engine. Ontorand is a highly
effective version of the DBFT consensus
protocol based on Onchain’s Distributed
Networks Architecture (DNA). It has
reached near-infinite scalability and
requires a relatively low hashing rate,
making it highly unlikely to experience
forks of the network. Ontorand’s
block-creation speed is only limited

to internet speed, usually resulting in
confirmations within 20 seconds. As a
truly decentralized protocol, Ontorand
entitles its users to consensus rights,
eliminating cases where miners or other
parties solely control confirmation
power. Ontorand selects who confirms
the blockchain using a verifiable random
unction, every confirmation receiving
an Ontology seed directing to the next
confirmation. Ontorand also supports
pluggable verifiers and online protocol
recovery and upgrade. Meanwhile, in

order to meet needs

rom different chains in Ontology,

the distributed ledger framework

also supports pluggable consensus
mechanisms including DBFT, RBFT, and
custom PoW.

New Member Control

In Ontology community managers can
build their communities steadily by
managing the inflow of members into

the community.

Community Ranking

Most communities have ranking
system where different users hold
different levels of authority and
discourse power. In Ontology users can
present their DIDs or other evidence
of experience (for example someone
presenting proof of a Java community
group they manage) to community
managers to receive recognition.

21

Other Features

To address the difficulty of certifying
an individual's authority and credibility
within a distributed community

Ontology has integrated:

A public credibility system.
According to the personal details,
publication history, and chat
history of an individual, the com-
munity can carry out multi-party
evaluation of community members

to reward public credibility.

Content publication control.
Controlling false or inappropriate
information in distributed com-

munities is essential. Ontology
offers a system where users with
authority can directly push content
and ordinary users must first pass

content approval.

An incentivization design. A reward
mechanism recognizes content
creators for the reactions their
content receives from other
community members (such as
“likes”). All content reactions

are recorded to the blockchain to

avoid data manipulation.
PART III: ONTOLOGY'S ECOSYSTEM AND APPLICABLE SCENARIOS

@ Distributed Content Generation and Trade Modules

Current services can convert content into tangible assets (e.g. paid
content) or into other types of intangible assets (e.g. content publishing
with a profit model), though nevertheless at a cost to the content
producer. Ontology, however, has introduced a comprehensive distributed

trade system between content generator and consumer.

Optimized Content Search

Users can choose to only view content produced by users
with a certain reputation level or entrust third-parties for
content recommendations. In this system users have greater
control in getting the content they want and can getting a

® Decentralized Inclusive Financial Services

Small businesses and individuals often lack credit records and collateral
while facing high operation costs. This makes them riskier for banks and
other financial institutions, leading to high interest rates. At the same

time the cost of change is high and businesses face retributions to their

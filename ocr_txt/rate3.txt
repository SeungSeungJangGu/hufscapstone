12 Risks & Disclaimers
INTRODUCTION

A financial infrastructure that can support the Internet economy as it continues to grow is
necessary. We observed a strong organic growth and unparalleled innovation from the Internet
back in 1990s. However, established financial institutions hampered innovation and growth in
exchange for ensuring integrity of financial transactions. There is a demand for new and
innovative players, a void to be filled by blockchain technology. We need a new fair and just
financial system.

Today's e-commerce system is imperfect with high processing fees, poor exchange rates,
chargeback risks and frauds, opaque consumer reward schemes and a poor credit assessment
for those who need it the most.

We can make it better, through tokenization. The Rate3 Dual Protocol is a decentralized protocol
for cross-border payment and credit scoring. By introducing a native token (the RTE token), it
will help to align the incentives of all participants. Through carefully designed token economic
mechanisms, it is a self-sustaining and growing system.

A protocol without data and adoption is futile. We propose a novel Cross-Border Payment
Protocol (CPP) that simultaneously fuel transactions between consumers and merchants, while
collecting the requisite transaction data to bootstrap the Credit Scoring Protocol (CSP). The
Credit Scoring Protocol, in turn, helps to create more credit loans and drive more transactions as
a result. Building open protocols also allow for other adjacent decentralized apps (dApps) to be
built on top of our protocols.

By building this protocol layer for global cross-border e-commerce, we foresee various adjacent
dApps to be built on top of the Rate3 Dual Protocol: offline cross-border payments, e-commerce
insurance dApps, all kinds of credit loan products and even supply chain dApps in the future.

1]. MARKET

The global cross-border e-commerce market in 2015 accounted for USD 300
billion GMV, about 15% of e-commerce overall. This rapid growth, however, has
just begun and will continue: the cross-border market is expected to grow by
about 25% annually until 2020 - nearly twice the rate of domestic e-commerce
and a growth rate that most traditional retail markets would dream of achieving.
In 2020, it is expected to account for about USD 900 billion GMV, translating into
a roughly 22% share of the global e-commerce market. This growth momentum

yields unrivaled opportunity for both merchants and manufacturers:

PROBLEMS
2 PROBLEMS

Despite the immense potential of global cross-border e-commerce, several key problems still
exist within:

« High transaction processing fees

= Poor exchange rates

=" Chargeback risks for merchants

=" Delayed cashback for consumers

" Challenges with credit for both merchants and consumers

2.1 HIGH TRANSACTION PROESSING S

A standard domestic transaction includes five players: the consumer, the consumer's issuing
bank, the processing network, the merchant's acquiring bank and the merchant. However, cross-
border payments include many other players.

Cross-border payments are thus especially challenging, given more intermediaries and risks
involved.

Merchants also pay a processing fee for receiving payments from consumers. Transactional fees
stand somewhere between 2 - 5% per transaction plus a fixed fee of between USD 0.1 and USD
0.7.

For example: every time someone makes a transaction for USD 10, the merchant on average pays
USD 0.8 for banks, credit card associations, payment gateways and processors.

On top of transactional fees, some merchants might have to pay for incidental fees that include
Address Verification Service (AVS), Voice Authorization Fees (VAF), Batch Fees, and Non-Sufficient
Fund Fees (NFS) for cross-border purchases.

An existing example would be that of PayPal: PayPal charges the merchant a transaction fee of
4.4% + a currency - dependent fixed fee for any cross-border transaction, instead of the usual 2.9%
for domestic transactions.

2.2 POOR CROSS-BORDER EXCHANGE RATES

One of the primary hurdles to accomplishing an electronic payment is the need for trust
between the parties. Two parties directly transacting often lack a means of verifying each
other's identities or of ensuring that the transaction is carried out as agreed upon. When
parties lack a direct relationship of trust, this uncertainty can serve as an insurmountable
roadblock. Consequently, the various mechanisms for executing payments, both domestic and
international, all revolve around providing a trusted intermediary to mitigate this uncertainty.

Banks most traditionally serve as the trusted intermediary. However, cross-border payments
have a higher number of intermediaries involved. Given the complexity in exchange rates,
banks often charge an unfavorable exchange rate for such payments:

=» Dynamic Currency Conversion (1-5% additionally on the mid-market rate)
= Foreign Currency Conversion Processing fees (3-5% additionally)

2.5 CHARGEBACK RISKS FOR MERCHANTS

A chargeback (also known as a reversal) is a form of customer protection provided by the issuing
banks, which allows cardholders to file a complaint regarding fraudulent transactions on their
statement. Once the cardholder files a dispute, the issuing bank makes an investigation into the
complaint.

In 2016 alone, e-commerce merchants suffered an estimate loss of $6.7 billion in revenue due
to chargebacks, with $4.8 billion attributed to chargeback fraud.

The cost of chargebacks does not result only in financial losses. Racking up chargebacks has even
worse consequences on the part of the merchant. During online transactions, merchants are
solely responsible. Having too many cases of chargebacks will lead to steeper chargeback fees, as
merchants will become labelled by the credit card institution as a high-risk merchant.

2.4 CASHBACK DELAY FOR CONSUMERS

Cashback shopping is a form of price promotion online where consumers initiate purchases
at the website of a cashback company and after a significant delay, receive the savings
promised to them. Cashback shopping is a relatively young but increasingly popular
alternative. For example, Ebates, the leading cashback company in the United States, has
processed cashback payments of over $800 million to more than 10 million consumers since
its founding in 1998. In the United Kingdom, Quidco processed more than $64 million of
cashback payments to its seven million registered users in 2016 alone, and facilitated sales of
about $1 billion for 4,300 retailers—a figure that represents 1% of all electronic commerce in
the country for that year.

The cashback company make cashback payments directly into the bank accounts of
individual consumers. Importantly, the temporal delay between a purchase and the
corresponding payment is significant: a minimum of 30 days, but often as much as four
months.

This cashback delay is a result of the manual way the merchant's acquiring bank reconciles
with the consumer's issuing bank. Both parties have to verify that the transaction is
successfully made, before the acquiring bank will release the cashback payments. This is
another issue that a distributed ledger will not face

2.5 EXISTING CHALLENGES WITH CREDIT

Commercial lenders have made it difficult for small businesses to secure a loan - whether fixed
or working capital. This is where alternative lending comes into play to support the finances of
such businesses. The business financing options swooped in to fulfill the requirements of the
companies. It is believed that every 1 in 5 small business loans will be offered by an alternative
lender by 2020. The alternative lending market, as of today, stands at $5 billion, which is
expected to reach $52 billion by that time.

Merchants need access to capital and loans to buy more inventories and expand their
businesses with new products but however, their business model is difficult for traditional
lenders to provide them a proper score.

Amazon issued US$IB in loans in 2017 to merchants selling on its marketplace. The data points
from more than 2 million merchants on its platform help identify those it deem credit worthy.
Transaction processing companies PayPal Holdings Inc and Square Inc offer similar credit
options using data from their payments businesses, creating new financing options for small
merchants that could have trouble securing loans from banks. PayPal in May announced it has
issued more than US$3 billion in loans to more than 115,000 businesses globally through its
PayPal Working Capital program launched in 2013. Square said it has provided more than US$1.5
billion in loans and merchant cash advances since launching in 2014, including US$251 million in
the first quarter.

Shopify created Shopify Capital, a merchant cash advance product to help entrepreneurs secure
financing and accelerate their business growth. Shopify tailors cash advances to each
merchant's needs based on data processed through the Shopify platform. Since its launch in
April 2016, Shopify Capital has issued nearly $100 million in merchant cash advances and is being
used by thousands of entrepreneurs to purchase equipment and inventory, launch new
products, hire more employees, and add new sales channels.

RATES DUAL PROTOCOL
4 RATES DUAL-PROTOCOL

Rate3 is a decentralized dual protocol for cross-border payment and credit scoring.

The primary challenge facing any protocol is adoption. This challenge is similar to one that
many marketplaces face early on: a marketplace is said to have “network effects” if it grows in
value over time, but there remains the question of how the early users of the network will be
enlisted: the “adoption problem”. Our solution is to introduce a killer solution, one that provides

an inherent utility to users of the platform, even in the absence of the strong network effects
early in the life of the platform.

The initial adoption solution is the Rate3 Cross-Border Payment Protocol (CPP), with the
Credit Scoring Protocol (CSP) as the subsequent growth solution.
The Engineering Design for Rate3 Dual Protocol

The Rate3 Dual Protocol follows the best engineering practices to ensure they are interoperable,
cost efficient, seamless and trustless:

e Generic - The Rate3 Dual Protocol is designed to be useful and reusable in order to be
interpolated for further sharing economy and marketplace dApps such as insurance, supply
chain, offline payments

e Cost Efficient - Protocols are given the option to utilize cheaper alternatives for expensive on-
chain transactions, by offloading heavy and complex computations to traditional cloud-based
solutions. This introduces centralization and is a reasonable stopgap solution while looking for a
long term scalable blockchain solution.

e Seamless - The Rate3 Dual Protocol is designed with a key focus of being seamless, user-
friendly, whilst providing an easy layer for other dApp developers to built on top of the protocol
layer

e Trustless - Transactions sent are immutable, and there is no single trust required from any

single actor in the system. The transactions live on the Stellar Blockchain, and anyone can
access them
4.] RATES CROSS-BORDER PAYMENT PROTOCOL

The Rate3 Cross-Border Payment Protocol (CSP) is the core pillar that enables both
consumers and merchants to enjoy zero transaction fees and mid-market exchange rates. The
protocol provides a compelling, unique value proposition to buyers and sellers alike, while
seeding the entire network with valuable transaction data. The seeded transaction data will, in
turn, help to fuel the Credit Scoring Protocol (CSP).

Using a decentralized ledger helps to ensure integrity over every transaction. More importantly,
it provides the mechanism for consumers to make cross-border payments to merchants with
no transaction fees, perfect mid-market exchange rates and more importantly, enjoy instant
cashback in the form of RTE tokens upon each successful transaction.

Likewise, for merchants, they do not have to pay any fee to any intermediary payment
processor, the card network and their acquiring bank, greatly reducing their entire cost
structure.

4.1.1 BENEFITS FOR BUYERS

NO TRANSACTION FEES

The CPP charges 0% transaction fees to both consumers and merchants, due to smart
contracts automating transactions that bypass commission-based platforms, financial
institutions, and currency denominations. As the RTE token is used as a medium of exchange
for all transactions, this ensures that there are no intermediaries in the process to take a cut of
the transaction, leaving all savings passed back to the consumers and merchants.

MID-MARKET RATE

The amount needed to pay is converted to the selected Stellar-based token from traditional
currency in real-time. Money arrives in the merchant’s smart contract wallet almost
instantaneously. The amount of Stellar-based currency received is exchanged to a merchant's
preferred fiat currency according to the merchant's preference of crypto exchange API.
Through Stellar’s network of anchors, the RTE received can be easily converted to the
merchant's preferred fiat or crypto-currency through pathfinding algorithms and network. At
the same time, when merchants use the Rate merchant interface, they

have the option to choose the frequency at which crypto tokens are converted to fiat, the local
currency to exchange to, time of sending money to their bank account, and many other
options.

Since cross-asset payments are so simple with Rate3, users can keep their money in whatever
asset they prefer to hold. This is how the Rate3 Network creates a very flexible and open system.

INSTANT CASHBACK

As a consumer making cross-border payments with Rate3 Network, they will automatically be
rewarded with instant cashback in the form of RTE tokens for every successful transaction. This %
cashback mechanism is determined by the merchant itself. This instant cashback mechanism is
automatically triggered upon a successful transaction, through a smart contract.

Consumers can access their RTE token balance directly from their RateX or RateS wallet. With
these RTE tokens, they can spend it on other goods by sending these RTE tokens directly to
supported merchants. Alternatively, they can simply convert it to other fiat currencies through
the Mainnet.

Combining perfect mid-market exchange rates and instant cashback could potentially bring the
savings on a single transaction to 15-20% for consumers. Given the decentralized and trustless
nature of these transactions, there are no additional intermediaries to assert control and draw a
fee from the transactions.

More importantly, the CPP does not benefit the consumer alone. The token has to incentivize
other participants as well and this includes the merchants too.

4.1.2 BENEFITS FOR MERCHANTS

NO PROCESSING FEES

The CPP helps to power a payment infrastructure which is decentralised, interopable, fungible
and secure. More importantly, the CPP allows for cross-asset transfers to be completed directly
from consumer to merchant, without any intermediaries like payment processors, merchant
acquiring banks and card networks. By cutting away these additional intermediaries who draw
fees upon every transaction, the Payment Protocol helps merchants to achieve no processing
fees, unlike the traditional 3 - 5% fee.

Instead, there is only a small network gas fee, and this fee will be contributed to the Rate3
Redistribution Pool. More will be explained in the Rate3 Redistribution Pool.

MID-MARKET EXCHANGE RATES

Payment intermediaries charge extra percentage fee on top of their exchange when merchants
want to accept foreign currencies and settle payments in their preferred currency. The CPP
does not charge fees for converting captured payments to settlement currency, as it is powered
by Stellar’s native distributed decentralized exchange.

NO CHARGEBACK RISKS

In a traditional credit card transaction, merchants pull sensitive data from a customer’s card to
complete a sale. During that transfer, consumers are at risk of having personal data hacked,
stolen and used by fraudsters. However, the blockchain structure behind bitcoins is virtually
immune to hacking risks, merchants never have to worry that payments are fraudulent.

This protection extends even after a blockchain transaction. When a customer files a credit card
chargeback, the card issuer immediately refunds the purchaser’s money while the chargeback
is reviewed (rarely ending in a favorable ruling for the merchant). But making a purchase with
bitcoins virtually eliminates chargeback risks for merchants. There are no dispute procedures
and no third party with which a consumer can file complaints.

When a purchase is made through a credit card and then is chargeback not only does the
money from the transaction get taken from the merchant and given back to the customer,
merchants also get costly chargeback fees. All blockchain transactions are protected by the

bitcoin network which mean merchants can accept payments without worrying about the
threat of fraud or chargebacks.

App supported methods (credit

RE card, bank transfer, BTC/LTC/ETH
wallet, RTE wallet, etc)

The CPP will be implemented on Rate3 MainNet as Stellar Smart Contracts (SSC) on the
Stellar blockchain. As such, consumers and merchants are required to have Stellar accounts.
They must also be able to sign Stellar transactions directly or indirectly (managed by dApp).

Stellar contracts works different from Ethereum - they have to be chained, signed and
submitted as a network transaction instead of the smart contract code being deployed on-
chain. Once the transaction is filled out, all the needed signatures must be collected and
added to the transaction envelope. Thereafter, the transaction can be submitted and applied
to the ledger via Stellar Consensus Protocol.

CONSUMERS: SENDING CROSS-BORDER PAYMENTS

Real world assets such as dollars, euros, bitcoin, stocks, gold, or even physical goods like
bananas can be tokenized on the Stellar network. The Stellar distributed network can then be
used to track, hold and transfer these Stellar asset tokens (henceforth referred as assets for
brevity).

As such, the Rate3 MainNet will theoretically be able to support consumer payment in any
desired assets as long as they are tokenized on the Stellar network.

1. Issuer: Tokenize any assets they wish to support but not found in the network. (Issuer)

For example, if a dApp would like to support payments in “The Best Dollar”, they will have to
issue TBD assets on the Stellar network . A more interesting example would be if a dApp would
like support payments using their ERC-20 utility token “DCoin”. It will have to take on the role of
an anchor in Stellar network and issue DCoin Stellar tokens. (Note: the dApp would have to
implement atomic-swap between Stellar and Ethereum Dcoin tokens)

2. Anchor: Perform capture of non-Stellar assets and issue credits into the network

dApps may use auxillary services to capture and liquidate assets from consumers. In the case
where a consumer is paying USD with their credit cards, dApps would have to process the
credit card using a card processor. Once the payment is captured, USD asset should be issued
to consumer's Stellar account. dApps do not have to be confined to fiat currencies — crypto-
assets can be accepted as payments which have to be then converted or issued on the Stellar
network. dApps may also choose to liquidate the crypto-assets at an exchange for USD and
credit USD to consumers’ accounts.

Asset conversions in Rate3 MainNet are powered by Stellar’s native decentralized distributed
exchange, which contains offers and orderbooks. When the need arises to do complicated asset
conversion, pathfinding involves looking at current orderbooks and finding which series of
conversions gives you the best rate. These paths of asset conversion can contain up to 6 hops,
but the whole payment is atomic-it will either succeed or fail. The payment sender will never be
left holding an unwanted asset.

RTE will be used as a medium-of-exchange for all payments and hence the pathfinding must
include RTE i.e. USD -> RTE -> SGD or SGD -> RTE -> SGD or USD -> ... -> RTE -> ... -> SGD. There
can only be a maximum of 6 hops.

In Stellar, asset transactions, including pathfinding, are considered network operations. A
contract transaction is made up of multiple network operations. A transaction median
confirmation time in Stellar is 3-5 seconds. This means that on Rate3 MainNet, the entire process
of issuing new assets to consumer account, pathfinding and asset arriving at destination
account is confirmed within 3-5 seconds.

INSTANT CASHBACK

Cashback will be credited to consumers’ accounts instantly from Rate3 MainNet Redistribution
pool account. The cashback will be in the form of RTE tokens. This will be reflected as one of the
operations in the payment contract transaction aforementioned. More details on how instant
cashback forms one part of the incentive mechanism can be found in the token economics
section, detailed behind.

MERCHANTS: RECEIVING CROSS-BORDER PAYMENTS

Merchants will receive instant payment in desired settlement currency. 0.5% gas fee will be
deducted from settled payment amount and currency and converted to RTE via pathfinding to
be deposited to the redistribution pool account. Again, these are dictated in the single payment
contract transaction.

VIEWING PAST TRANSACTIONS

Retrieving past transactions data on Rate3 MainNet will be reading immutable transaction data
from the distributed ledger. The ledger data will be additionally processed and formatted
accordingly in Rate3 context.

4.2 RATES CREDIT SCORE PROTOCOL

The Rate3 CPP solves initial adoption problem, but the Credit Score Protocol (CSP) is the
subsequent growth solution to grow the ecosystem further. The Rate3 Network addresses the
existing limitations in lending by moving credit scoring and risk assessment to the blockchain.
Rate3 Network is a standardized, programmable ecosystem to facilitate on-demand, secure, and
global access to credit services. Rate3 helps increase competition to lower fees and improve both
the borrower and lender experience at every layer of the credit issuance process.

We present solutions to

(1) Cross-border credit scoring: Allows for credit scoring to move across borders. They are
previously tied onto their countries, and are forced to rebuild and re-establish their credit score
from scratch whenever they relocate

(2) Current uncompetitive ecosystem for credit scoring: Credit data is centralized. In most

markets, a single provider scores credit, resulting in an uncompetitive ecosystem for evaluating
credit risk.
The CSP is a dynamic indicator of an individual's likelihood to pay debts that adapts to the
maturity of a user’s credit history (or lack thereof). By splitting a user’s credit scoring
mechanism into multiple funnels that take into account different data points with varying
weights, the Rate3 credit score produces a score that is conducive to building credit from the
ground up while helping creditors differentiate the credit risk of consumers in markets and

communities with sparse data.

The foundation of a decentralized credit system is a securely established and verified identity.
In order to prevent against common network attacks (such as Sybil attacks), each participant's
identity must be adequately established with a high cost of attempting to create new, false

identities that appear authentic.

4.2.1 PROOF O

FRANSACTIONS, IDENTITY & ATTESTATIO

Credit scoring and risk assessment is complicated. The Rate3 CSP provides a open-source
solution to achieve this, through a thorough assessment of a potential borrower's Proof-of-
Transactions, Proof-of-ldentity and Proof-of-Attestation on the Rate3 Mainnet.

4.2.1 BENEFITS FOR BORROWERS

ALIGNED INCENTIVES

Borrower are incentivized to submit relevant information, in return for a discount on their loan
repayments. In traditional centralised credit marketplaces, borrowers often have to subscribe to
the guidelines dictated by that marketplace. However, it might not be suitable for different
borrowers. Having a tiered system of information submission helps to align the borrower's
incentives.

ACCESS TO CREDIT

Many participants — including both consumers and smaller merchants — are often excluded
from the current credit system. The CSP uses an alternative scoring mechanism to gauge and
assess potential borrowers, who would otherwise not have access to credit for products or
sustain their business.

FULL CONTROL & TRANSPARENCY

Borrowers have full control over the kind of information they want to upload, so long as they
deem it relevant and appropriate.

4.2.2 BENEFITS FOR LENDERS

ACCESS TO A NEW GLOBAL POOL OF BORROWERS

The Rate3 Network is designed to be transnational, borderless, immutable and transparent
with Stellar and Ethereum as its core. Given the global nature, traditional capital providers and
financial institutions will have access to new borrowers, all of whom they are unable to access
previously.

BETTER PERFORMING LOANS

Borrowers have an added incentive to upload more relevant documents, given the discount
they will get back on repayments. In turn, this helps to add more certainty to borrower
documents and loan requests, creating better performing loans.

CSP will be implemented on Rate3 MainNet as smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum
blockchain. As such, borrowers and lenders are required to have Ethereum accounts. They
must also be able to sign Ethereum transactions directly or indirectly (managed by dApp).
Once transactions are signed and submitted, they will be validated via Ethereum Proof-of-
Work consensus mechanism.

BORROWER: SUBMISSION OF PROOFS

A borrower will need to upload documents to Rate3 Mainnet in order to establish their Proof-
of-Identity and Proof-of-Attestation. These files should be digitally signed by borrower private
key to ensure non-repudiation and integrity of the documents. Should there be concerns of
privacy, the documents can also be encrypted with agreed lender’s public key so that only the
lender is able to decrypt and view the documents. The borrower should then host the
documents on IPFS and pass the file hash link and lender public key to Rate3 MainNet.

DISCOUNT ON LOAN REPAYMENTS

The discount on loan repayments will be issued to borrower in the form of RTE tokens. More
details on how loan repayment discounts form a critical part of the incentive mechanism can
be found in the subsequent token economics section.

LENDER: ACCESS TO PROOFS

Lenders will pay fees - in the form of RTE tokens - to Rate3 MainNet and receive the following
signed and encrypted data:

= Borrower's Proof-of-Transaction
= Borrower's Proof-of-Identity
= Borrower's Proof-of-Attestation

TOKENOMICS
5.1) WHY TOKENIZE?

A well-designed token network carefully manages the distribution of tokens and incentives
across all groups of network participants (buyers, sellers, borrowers, lenders and other financial
institutions).

A native RTE Token that interacts with the Rate platform allows the network to have aligned
goals and incentives, prepares a platform to be agnostic to a singular cryptocurrency or digital
token, and allows better management of the side chain.

The native RTE token is not simply a medium of exchange in this ecosystem, but a store of
value that aligns the incentives of all participants.

The RTE token is used not only as a means of exchange or payment on the Rate3 network but
also as a means to account for, judge, verify and incentivize ecosystem participation. The RTE
token is the native fuel that facilitates interactions on the Rate3 network.

UTILITY FUNCTION 1: INSTANT CASHBACK FOR CONSUMERS UPON EACH
SUCCESSFUL TRANSACTION

CPP: As captured in the smart contracts, consumers will receive an instant variable % cashback,
in the form of RTE tokens when they complete a successful purchase. The % is determined by
the merchants. It is instant because there is no need for the merchant's acquiring banks and
the consumer's issuing banks to finish settlements on both ends. Likewise, the % on cashback
can be adjusted to incentivize consumers more. For instance, if merchants want to reward
consumers more, they can do so as well.

UTILITY FUNCTION 2: PAYMENT OF NETWORK FEES BY MERCHANTS

CPP: merchants only pay a minimal network fee in the form of RTE tokens, upon a successful
transaction. This network fee is immediately paid to the Redistribution pool after every
successful transaction.
UTILITY FUNCTION 3: DISCOUNT ON REPAYMENT INTEREST RATE FOR
BORROWERS

CSP: Borrowers receive a discount on loan repayments in the form of RTE tokens if they submit
more relevant information. This discount is instantly activated in the term repayments as
written in the Ethereum smart contracts.

UTILITY FUNCTION 4: PAYMENT TO ACCESS

CSP: Lenders pay fees in the form of RTE tokens to access borrower's credit score, Proof-of-
Transactions, Proof-of-Identity and other attestation documents.

UTILITY FUNCTION 5: INCENTIVES FOR DEVELOPMENT

CPP and CSP: Developers are incentivized with RTE tokens when they develop dApps on the
ecosystem.

5.3 ALIGNING OF INCENTIVES FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS

With the use of a single token, RTE aligns the incentives for all groups of
participants:
FOR CONSUMERS:

= Consumers save up to 20% through our CPP: zero transaction fees, perfect mid-market
exchange rates and cashback

= Enjoy instant cashback because it is written into smart contracts, as compared to the current
30 - 60 days wait for cashback settlements to reach bank accounts

= absolute transparency since every transactions are recorded on an immutable ledger

FOR MERCHANTS:

= Pay network fees, in RTE tokens to accept transactions
= Save up to 10% fees on processing transactions, as compared to current payment processors
= Benefit from reduced chargeback risks and frauds

FOR BORROWERS:

= Incentivized to submit more information to enjoy a greater discount on repayment interest
rates

FOR LENDERS:

= Pay fees in RTE tokens, to access borrowers’ credit score and borrowers’ Proof-of-
Transactions, Proof-of-Identity and additional relevant attestation documents

FOR DEVELOPERS:

= Receive RTE tokens as incentives for creating dApps on the ecosystem
5.3 RISE IN TOKEN VALUE AND APPRECIATION

As the number of participants (consumers, merchants, borrowers, lenders) increase, the
transaction volume and loan volume increases as well. Given the delay between lenders paying
fees in RTE tokens and borrowers receiving a discount in their delayed repayments, this
increases the amount of RTE tokens in the Redistribution Pool. The number of RTE tokens in
circulation (not staked in the Redistribution Pool) goes down with user adoption and increased
volume, thereby decreasing total circulating supply.

1.

Increase in Transaction Volume: a % of transactions will be allocated back to the
redistribution pool and taken out of total circulating supply

Increase in Loan Volume: there is a delay between lenders paying RTE tokens and
borrowers receiving a discount in RTE tokens on the discount rate. When there is a higher
loan volume, the more tokens get taken out of the total circulating supply.

6 NETWORK RISKS

6.1 SYBIL ATTACKS

In the context of a lending protocol, a Sybil attack involves generating a large number of
fraudulent identities, taking on multiple unsecured debts at a time, and defaulting on all at
once with little consequence. Largely, defending against Sybil attacks falls within the purview of
an underwriter's responsibilities -- if an underwriter's identification and KYC procedures are not
robust enough to detect Sybil behavior, the empirical performance of debts they've attested to
will reflect it. However, Sybil attackers could ostensibly solicit debt orders from several
underwriters at a time, meaning that data sharing amongst underwriters operating in similar
debt verticals would likely become a pertinent need.

To reiterate - the Lender must do their own due diligence on top of utilizing our credit score
protocol, to make sure that they know who they are lending to enough.

6.2 DISTRIBUTED DENIAL OF SERVIC

A network service can be disrupted if there is a coordinated flood of network operations from
multiple sources intended to overwhelm the network. This is known as distributed denial of
service (DDoS). Disruption of time-sensitive service such as payments will detrimental to
network participants’ confidence and satisfaction, which is critical for a payment network to
thrive. Cross-Border Payment Protocol mitigates this risk by having RDP costs to deter any
DDoS attempt. In the event a DDOS is in process, although some users will be affected.

Credit Score Protocol is powered by Ethereum and the gas fees acts as the deterrence for
planned DDoS. Given that Stellar and Ethereum are decentralized network, a DDoS attack on
Rate3 would mean a DDoS attack on respective blockchains.

6.3 Fraudulent Underwriters

Underwriters operating in a fraudulent manner can deceive investors into believing that they
are originating prime debt from borrowers, when in reality they are in fact acting as borrowers
themselves. Conceivably, a fraudulent underwriter could build up an extremely positive on-
chain attestation performance by lending to themselves using many assumed public keys, and
then execute a large exit scam by deceiving creditors into investing in Debt Orders they've
attested to in which they are the actual borrower and defaulting entirely on those debts.

Solution: None. This will cause us to be NOT TRUSTLESS. It is for this reason that we emphasize
that Rate 3 Credit Score Protocol is not a fully trustless protocol -- borrowing and lending under
this scheme is only safe insofar as underwriters are known, trusted entities, and not
pseudonymized public keys.

7.1 OFFLINE CROSS-BORDER PAYMENTS

RATE3 X BRAHMAOS: THE FUTURE OF OFFLINE CROSS-BORDER PAYMENTS

This upcoming partnership allows Rate3 users to pay for offline purchases through the Rate3
mobile wallet, with absolutely zero transaction fees and exchange rate mark up. This is similar
to how Rate3 helps to facilitate online payments here. An analogous example is that of WeChat
Pay and Line Pay being used by Chinese and Thailand tourists, when they shop in other
countries.

Imagine this scenario: Tommy is a tourist from Indonesia, who is travelling in Vietnam. For his
purchases in Vietnam, he can either pay with Vietnamese dong, his debit/credit card or through
Rate3. With his Rate3 mobile wallet at supported merchants, Rate3 will use the Stellar network
to convert his Indonesian rupiah in his bank account to Vietnamese dong at the merchant's
POS. Transactions are fast, seamless and there is no additional mark-up on the exchange rate
between IDR and VND.

Merchants that partner with us will be accepting Rate3 offline payments and benefit from an
increased volume of offline tourists. Likewise, for tourists, they benefit from an easier mode of
payment (through their mobile phone) and much cheaper exchange rate fees.

2 STABLECOIN

One of the problems with using and accepting cryptocurrency for payment of goods and
services is that prices of cryptocurrency is volatile. Although price volatility does not matter if
the cryptocurrency is used in medium of transfer (like RTE), there should be a cryptocurrency
with a stable price to facilitate direct blockchain payments and confidence of stable value to
hold for future purchases.

A cryptocurrency with a price stabling mechanism to peg its value with another stable asset
like gold or US dollar is known as a stablecoin. Stablecoins allow merchants to accept
cryptocurrency as payment without exposure to crypto-market risks. From the consumer point
of view, they can also decide the point in time to convert their volatile cryptoassets to
stablecoins and hold them for future purchases denominated in fiat.

Consider the following scenario:

= Alice has some Bitcoin and price of Bitcoin increased over 10% in a week

« Alice decided to trade some Bitcoin for a stablecoins.

« Price of Bitcoin crash 20% the following week

« Alice is still able to make the same value of purchase using stablecoins before the price drop
for Bitcoin

After reaching certain level of network maturity, Rate3 will issue a stablecoin to scale the

network further. RTE will remain as an utility token.

7.3 CROSS-CHAIN PARTNERSHIPS: ZILLIQA

ZILLIQA is a high-throughput public blockchain platform designed to scale to thousands of
transactions per second. Zilliqa is linearly scalable as more miners nodes participate, the more
transactions the network can process at an almost linear rate.

For most blockchains the rate of return from network decrease the larger the network gets. In
Ethereum, a new miner has to receive transactions before being conformed. This means when
more miners join the network, each data about a block has to travel a lot more before being
part of the blockchain. This makes the network slower just as distribution information to many
people is slower than to a small number of people. This is why many solutions to accelerate
transaction throughput rely on restricting the number of nodes (e.g. permissioned blockchains)

Zilliqa’s linear scalability is made possible by using optimized practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant
protocol for consensus and blockchain network sharding. Rate3 will build CSP on Zilliqa to scale
beyond Ethereum network in terms of transaction speed and gas fee.

8 CROSS-CHAIN ARCHITECTURE

Initially, all RTE tokens distributed through the token sale exists as ERC-20 tokens on the
network. We will be able to leverage on the smart contracts on the Ethereum ecosystem.
However, we also want to deploy RTE as a Stellar asset to take advantage of the quick
transaction speeds and ease of asset exchanges on the Stellar network.

To be able to take advantage of the different benefits of being on different networks, our RTE
token can be on both the Ethereum and Stellar network through cross-chain atomic swaps
through a hashed time-lock contract. Users would be able to swap their RTE ERC-20 token on
their Ethereum wallet for a Stellar asset RTE token on their Stellar wallet. This swap is done
without needing a third party through smart contract.

This means that the total supply of RTE tokens will be spread across both networks. Only one
version of the token exist at any given point of time.

By having two versions of RTE tokens on different blockchains, we will be able to utilize the RTE
token much more effectively depending on the use case. For more complicated smart
contracts that requires the Turing-complete nature of the of Ethereum, the ERC-20 version will
be required. For regular transactions and payments, the Stellar version of token is more
applicable.

Besides being able to increase the potential utility of the RTE token, by being on multiple
networks would mean increased liquidity for RTE, since there are now more ways to obtain RTE
tokens. RTE can now be on both Ethereum and Stellar decentralized exchanges, in addition to
centralized exchanges.

In the future, we will be able to expand our cross-chain architecture to include other
blockchains that support token creation.

9 ROADMAP & ADOPTION

PHASE 1: RTE PAYMENT PROTOCOL

Phase 1 will allow consumers and merchants to send and receive RTE as payment. Merchant
has to price its goods and services in RTE and the users have to obtain RTE either through
token sale, exchanges, or intermediaries. The goal is to set up protocol infrastructure and
integration interfaces required by dApps in the future. Internal prototypes for future phases will
also be carried out so that the protocol API design accounts for future integrations. This
prevents drastic core design changes in the protocol API and also speed up development in
future phases.

RateX will integrate with CPP to accept RTE as payment for its current services. Developers and
companies are free to integrate CPP

DEVELOPMENT OUTLINE:

Q2 2018
= Private TestNet
= Early TestNet API
= PoC integration with early prototypes of Rate3 interface platform for CSP and CPP
=» Payment gateway platform
= Credit score platform
= Universal Wallet (fiat and crypto-assets) for consumers as an easier means of payment
compared to payment forms
Gather feedback from PoC integrations with strategic partners and community
= Release TestNet to public

Q3 2018

=» MainNet

= CPP API with RTE payment only

= Support RTE tokens atomic swaps between Stellar and Ethereum
= Universal Wallet to facilitate token swap

PHASE 2: MULTI-ASSET PAYMENT WITH RTE AS MEDIUM OF EXCHANGE

Once CPP matures in Phase 1, multi-asset payment will be introduced with limited basket of
currencies. Implementation of multi-asset payments will start with same currency payments
with RTE as medium of transfer e.g USD -> RTE -> USD, followed by another major currency in
the network e.g SGD -> RTE -> SGD. Additional currency pairs will be added as network liquidity
increases.

RateX will launch payment gateway service powered by CPP.

Q3 2018
= Complete TestNet integration
= Payment gateway platform
= Merchant dashboard
= Merchant Server API and SDK
= Payment form SDK to collect payment from consumers
= Merchant Server API
= Payment form SDK to collect payment from consumers
= Customers’ Proof-of-Transaction score

Q4 2018
= Complete MainNet integration
= Launch of payment gateway platform powered by CPP

PHASE 3: CREDIT SCORING PROTOCOL

Phase 3 will deploy a platform where borrowers can submit Proof-of-Identity and other
documents and share with lenders. Lenders have to pay RTE to receive borrower's Proof-of-
Transaction, Proof-of-Identity and other documents

Q4 2018
=" TestNet
= CSP API

= Launch of CSP interface platform

PHASE 4 NETWORK STABILITY

Phase 4 is where Rate3 will work on technologies that can help scale adoption rate of the
network. Rate3 will expand CPP to offline payments via official dApp on Brahma OS. To further
improve throughput and reduce gas of CSP, Rate3 will move CSP to the more scalable Zilliga
blockchain.

Q2 2019 and beyond

= Roadmap for
" Offline payments: Brahma OS

Any fractional number of Tokens which you are entitled to receive for a confirmed purchase of Tokens (to the extent not
rejected by the Token Vendor in accordance with these Terms), determined based on the amount of ETH for such
confirmed purchase at the Purchase Consideration as received at the Designated Address in ETH, shall be rounded

down to the nearest 2" decimal place of a Token.

Notwithstanding the foregoing of this Paragraph 4.3, the Token Vendor reserves the right to adjust, in its sole and
absolute discretion, the Purchase Consideration at any time during the Sale Period.
Minimum Purchase Amount

4.4 The minimum Purchase Consideration for each purchase of Tokens is 0.5 ETH (excluding all administrative and/or
third party charges and/or other transaction fees (if any) that may be incurred by you in connection with such transfer of
ETH) (the “Minimum Purchase Amount’).

4.5 In the event that you attempt to purchase Tokens of an amount less than the Minimum Purchase Amount, you
acknowledge and agree that:

(a) provided that your transfer of ETH to the Designated Address as payment for such attempted purchase of
Tokens is validated and verified on the Ethereum blockchain as successful and complete and notwithstanding any
provision in these Terms, the Token Vendor may, at its sole and absolute discretion, provide a refund of such
transfer in full or in part without interest and net of all administrative and/or third party charges and/or other
transaction fees (if any) that may be incurred in connection with such refund, in which case such administrative
and/or third party charges and/or other transaction fees (if any) incurred in connection with such refund shall be
borne by you;

(b) save for any refund that the Token Vendor may elect to provide under Paragraph 4.5(a), the Token Vendor shall
have no obligations in any form or manner whatsoever to you in respect of such attempted purchase; and

(c) save for your right to such refund under Paragraph 4.5(a), you hereby waive all rights, claims and/or courses of
action (present or future) under law (including any tortious claims) or contract against the Token Vendor and the
Indemnified Persons in connection with or arising from such attempted purchase, and shall further hold harmless,
the Token Vendor and the Indemnified Persons from and against any and all losses, damages, taxes, liabilities and
expenses that may be incurred by you in connection with or arising from such attempted purchase.

4.6 The Purchase Consideration shall be exclusive of all administrative and/or third party charges and/or other
transaction fees (if any) that may be incurred in connection with your transfer of the Purchase Consideration for your
intended purchase of Tokens. Any such administrative and/or third party charges and/or other transaction fees (if any)
incurred in connection with your transfer of the Purchase Consideration for your intended purchase of Tokens shall be
borne by you.

4.7 It shall be your sole responsibility to ensure that the amount of transaction fees paid by you to miners in connection
with your transfer of ETH, as payment for your intended purchase of Tokens, is sufficient for your transfer to be validated
and verified on the Ethereum Blockchain as a successful and complete transfer prior to the Sale Expiry Time.

4.8 Any amount(s) of transaction fees recommended by the Token Vendor through the Channels or any other public or
private communication channel is only indicative, and may not be representative or reflective of the actual amount(s) of
transaction fees required for your transfer to be validated and verified on the Ethereum Blockchain as a successful and
complete transfer prior to the Sale Expiry Time. Accordingly, there is no assurance that any amount(s) of transaction fees
recommended by the Token Vendor through the Channels or any other public or private communication channel will
be sufficient for your transfer to be validated and verified on the Ethereum Blockchain as a successful and complete
transfer prior to the Sale Expiry Time.

Address for directing transfers of Purchase Consideration and holding of accepted Purchase Consideration in escrow
until delivery of Tokens

4.9 You shall transfer ETH as Purchase Consideration for your intended purchase of Tokens to the Designated Address as
may be provided to you by the Token Vendor within the Transfer Period.

4.10 Any transfer of ETH as Purchase Consideration for your intended purchase of Tokens under Paragraph 4.9 shall be
made from the address of the Ethereum Wallet which you have notified to the Token Vendor at the time of your
Registration and which is not an account or wallet established and maintained with any Centralised Exchange. In the
case where you transfer ETH to the Designated Address from the address of an account or wallet established and
maintained with any Centralised Exchange, regardless of whether such transfer is validated and verified on the
Ethereum Blockchain as successful and complete, you acknowledge and agree that:

(a) the Token Vendor shall not be under any obligation to deliver any Tokens to you;

(b) the Token Vendor shall not have any obligation to provide any refund for any part of such transfers of ETH to
the Designated Address to you;

(c) the Token Vendor shall not have any obligation in any form or manner whatsoever to you in respect of such
attempted purchase; and

(d) you hereby waive all rights, claims and/or courses of action (present or future) under law (including any tortious
claims) or contract against the Token Vendor and the Indemnified Persons in connection with or arising from such
attempted purchase, and shall further hold harmless, the Token Vendor and the Indemnified Persons from and
against any and all losses, damages, taxes, liabilities and expenses that may be incurred by you in connection with
or arising from such attempted purchase.

Attempts to double spend and purchases in violation of laws

4.11 In the event that the Token Vendor discovers, at any time after your acceptance of these Terms and prior to the
delivery of Tokens in accordance with Paragraph 6, any attempt by you to double spend ETH in the transfer of ETH as
Purchase Consideration for your attempted purchase, or that your purchase of Tokens is determined to be in violation of
any applicable laws, regulations or rules and you have made any transfers of ETH for such attempted purchase or such
attempted purchase is in violation of any applicable laws, regulations or rules, you acknowledge and agree, regardless of
whether such transfers of ETH as Purchase Consideration are reflected as validated and verified on the Ethereum
Blockchain, that the attempted purchase of Tokens will be regarded as invalid and/or void ab initio, and:

(a) the Token Vendor shall have no obligation to provide, and you shall have no right to receive, any refund for any
transfers of ETH made by you whether such transfer was made to the Designated Address and validated and
verified on the Ethereum Blockchain as successful and complete or otherwise;

(b) the Token Vendor shall not be obliged to deliver any Tokens to you and shall have no obligations in any form or
manner whatsoever to you in respect of such attempted purchase; and

attempted purchase, and shall further hold harmless, the Token Vendor and the Indemnified Persons from and
against any and all losses, damages, taxes, liabilities and expenses that may be incurred by you in connection with
or arising from such attempted purchase.

IT IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS NO ATTEMPT TO DOUBLE SPEND AND THAT YOUR

APPLICABLE LAWS, REGULATIONS OR RULES IF YOUR INTENTION IS NOT FOR PARAGRAPH 4.11 TO APPLY TO
YOUR PURCHASE OF TOKENS.

way whatsoever against the Token Vendor.

5.5 Any obligation of the Token Vendor to deliver any Tokens to you or provide you with any refund under these Terms
shall be subject to your compliance with the provisions of Paragraphs 5.1 to 5.3. In the event that the Token Vendor is
unable to deliver any Tokens to you or provide you with any refund under these Terms due to your Ethereum Wallet not
being initialised, valid or operational, the Token Vendor may, at its sole and absolute discretion, hold such Tokens or
refund in escrow or do such other acts as it may determine and shall not be obliged to deliver any Tokens to you or
provide you with any refund.

12 RISKS & DISCLAIMERS

RISK FACTORS

You should carefully consider and evaluate each of the following risk factors and all other information contained in the
Terms before deciding to participate in the Token Sale. To the best of the Token Vendor's knowledge and belief, all risk
factors which are material to you in making an informed judgement to participate in the Token Sale have been set out
below. If any of the following considerations, uncertainties or material risks develops into actual events, the business,
financial position and/or results of operations of the Token Vendor and the development, maintenance and level of
usage of the Rate3 Ecosystem could be materially and adversely affected. In such cases, the trading price of Tokens (in
the case where they are listed on a cryptocurrency exchange) could decline due to any of these considerations,
uncertainties or material risks, and you may lose all or part of your Tokens.

RISKS RELATING TO PARTICIPATION IN THE TOKEN SALE

Purchase of products, including but not limited to cryptocurrencies / cryptographic tokens, from start-ups such as
the Token Vendor involve a high degree of risk

Financial and operating risks confronting start-ups are significant and the Token Vendor is not immune to these. Start-
ups often experience unexpected problems in the areas of product development, marketing, financing, and general
management, among others, which frequently cannot be solved.

The Token Vendor may be forced to cease operations

It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, an unfavourable fluctuation in the value

of cryptographic and fiat currencies, the inability of the Token Vendor to establish the Rate3 Ecosystem or the Tokens’

utility, the failure of commercial relationships, or intellectual property ownership challenges, the Token Vendor may no
longer be viable to operate and the Token Vendor may dissolve or take actions that result in a dissolution of the Token

Vendor.

These Terms may not be transferred without the consent of the Company

These Terms provide that you may not transfer or assign these Terms and any such assignment or transfer shall not
impose any obligation or liability of the Token Vendor to the assignee or transferee.

There is no prior market for the Tokens and the Token Sale may not result in an active or liquid market for the
Tokens

The Tokens are intended to be native tokens to be used on the Rate3 Ecosystem, and the Token Vendor has not and
may not actively facilitate any secondary trading or external trading of Tokens. In addition, there is and has been no
public market for the Tokens and the Tokens are not traded, whether on any cryptocurrency exchange or otherwise. In
the event that the Tokens are traded on a cryptocurrency exchange, there is no assurance that an active or liquid
trading market for the Tokens will develop or if developed, be sustained after the Tokens have been made available for
trading on such cryptocurrency exchange. There is also no assurance that the market price of the Tokens will not
decline below the value at which it was purchased for (“Purchase Price”). The Purchase Price may not be indicative of
the market price of the Tokens after they have been made available for trading on a cryptocurrency exchange.

A Token is not a currency issued by any central bank or national, supra-national or quasi-national organisation, nor is it
backed by any hard assets or other credit. The Token Vendor is not responsible for nor does it pursue the circulation
and trading of the Tokens on the market. Trading of the Tokens merely depends on the consensus on its value between
the relevant market participants, and no one is obliged to acquire any Token from any holder of the Token, including
the purchasers of the Tokens in the Token Sale, nor does anyone guarantee the liquidity or market price of the Tokens
to any extent at any time. Accordingly, the Token Vendor cannot ensure that there will be any demand or market for
the Tokens, or that the Purchase Price is indicative of the market price of the Tokens after they have been made
available for trading on a cryptocurrency exchange. Hence, there is a risk that a purchaser could lose his entire
contribution amount. In the worst-case scenario, the Tokens could be rendered worthless.

The Token Vendor and the Indemnified Persons are not and shall not be responsible for or liable for the market value of
the Tokens, the transferability and/or liquidity of the Tokens and/or the availability of any market for the Tokens through
third parties or otherwise.

Future sales of the Tokens could materially and adversely affect the market price of Tokens

Any future sale of the Tokens (which were not available for sale in the Token Sale) would increase the supply of Tokens in
the market and this may result in a downward price pressure on the Tokens. The sale or distribution of a significant
number of Tokens outside of the Token Sale, or the perception that such further sales or issuance may occur, could
adversely affect the trading price of the Tokens.

Negative publicity may materially and adversely affect the price of the Tokens

Negative publicity involving (a) the Token Vendor; (b) the Rate3 Ecosystem; (c) the Tokens; and/or (d) any of the key
personnel of the Token Vendor, may materially and adversely affect the market perception or market price of the Tokens,
whether or not such publicity is justified.

There is no assurance of any success of the Rate3 Ecosystem

The value of, and demand for, the Tokens hinges heavily on the performance of the Rate3 Ecosystem. There is no
assurance that the Rate3 Ecosystem will gain traction after its launch and achieve any commercial success.

The Rate3 Ecosystem has not been fully developed, finalised and integrated and is subject to further changes, updates
and adjustments prior to its launch. Such changes may result in unexpected and unforeseen effects on its projected
appeal to users, and hence impact its success. There are no guarantees that the process for creating the Tokens will be
uninterrupted or error-free.

While the Token Vendor has made every effort to provide a realistic estimate, there is also no assurance that the
cryptocurrencies raised in the Token Sale will be sufficient for the development and integration of the Rate3 Ecosystem.
For the foregoing or any other reason, the development and integration of the Rate3 Ecosystem may not be completed
and there is no assurance that its systems, protocols or products will be launched at all. As such, distributed Tokens may
hold little worth or value, and this would impact its trading price.

The Tokens may be non-refundable

Except as provided under these Terms or prescribed by applicable laws and regulations, the Token Vendor is not obliged
to provide the purchasers with a refund of the Purchase Price. No promises of future performance or price are or will be
made in respect to the Tokens, including promises of inherent value or continuing payments, and there is no guarantee
that the Tokens will hold any particular value. Therefore, the recovery of the Purchase Price may be impossible or may be
subject to applicable laws and regulations.

The trading price of the Tokens may fluctuate following the Token Sale

The prices of cryptographic tokens in general tend to be relatively volatile, and can fluctuate significantly over short
periods of time. The demand for, and corresponding the market price of, the Tokens may fluctuate significantly and
rapidly in response to, among others, the following factors, some of which are beyond the control of the Token Vendor:

(a) new technical innovations;

(b) analysts’ speculations, recommendations, perceptions or estimates of the Tokens’ market price or the Token
Vendor's financial and business performance;

(c) changes in market valuations and token prices of entities with operations similar to that of the Token Vendor
that may be made available for sale and purchase on the same cryptocurrency exchanges as the Tokens;

(d) announcements by the Token Vendor of significant events, for example partnerships, sponsorships, new
product developments;

(e) fluctuations in market prices and trading volume of cryptocurrencies on cryptocurrency exchanges;

(f) additions or departures of key personnel and/or advisors of the Token Vendor;

(h) success or failure of the management of the Token Vendor in implementing business and growth strategies;
and

(i) changes in conditions affecting the blockchain or financial technology industry, the general economic
conditions or market sentiments, or other events or factors.

The digital assets raised in the Token Sale are exposed to risks of theft

Whilst the Token Vendor will make every effort to ensure that digital assets (such as cryptocurrencies, blockchain assets
and/or cryptographic tokens) received from the Token Sale are securely held at its Designated Address(es) or Receiving
Address(es) through the implementation of security measures, there is no assurance that there will be no theft of the
cryptocurrencies as a result of hacks, mining attacks (including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining
power attacks and “selfish-mining

RISKS RELATING TO THE TOKEN VENDOR

The Token Vendor may be materially and adversely affected if it fails to effectively manage its operations as its
business develops and evolves, which would have a direct impact on its ability to maintain the Rate3 Ecosystem
and consequently the trading price of the Tokens.

The financial technology and cryptocurrency industries and the markets in which the Token Vendor operates in have
grown rapidly and continue to grow rapidly and evolve in response to new technological advances, changing business
models and other factors. As a result of this constantly changing environment, the Token Vendor may face operational
difficulties in adjusting to the changes, and the sustainability of the Token Vendor will depend on its ability to manage
its operations, adapt to technological advances and market trends and ensure that it hires qualified and competent
employees, and provide proper training for its personnel.

The ability of the senior management team of the Token Vendor which is responsible for maintaining competitive
position of the Rate3 Ecosystem is dependent to a large degree on the ability of each member of that team. The loss or
diminution in the services of members of respective senior management team or an inability to attract, retain and
maintain additional senior management personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Rate3 Ecosystem.
Competition for personnel with relevant expertise is intense due to the small number of qualified individuals, and this
situation seriously affects the ability to retain its existing senior management and attract additional qualified senior
management personnel, which could have a significant adverse impact on the growth and operations of the Rate3
Ecosystem.

As its business evolves, the Token Vendor must also expand and adapt its operational infrastructure. The Token
Vendor's business relies on its blockchain-based software systems, cryptocurrency wallets or other related token
storage mechanisms, blockchain technology and smart contract technology, and to manage technical support
infrastructure for the Rate3 Ecosystem effectively, the Token Vendor will need to continue to upgrade and improve its
data systems and other operational systems, procedures and controls. These upgrades and improvements will require a
dedication of resources, are likely to be complex and increasingly rely on hosted computer services from third parties
that the Token Vendor does not control. If the Token Vendor is unable to adapt its systems and organisation in a timely,
efficient and cost-effective manner to accommodate changing circumstances, its business strategies, results of
operations and prospectus may be adversely affected. If the third parties whom the Token Vendor relies on are subject
to a security breach or otherwise suffer disruptions that impact the services the Token Vendor utilises, the integrity and
availability of its internal information could be compromised, which may consequently cause the loss of confidential or
proprietary information, and economic loss.

The loss of financial, labour or other resources, and any other adverse effect on the Token Vendor's business strategies,
results of operations and prospects, would have a direct adverse effect on the Token Vendor's ability to maintain the
Rate3 Ecosystem. As the Rate3 Ecosystem is the main product to which the Tokens relate, this may adversely impact
the trading price of the Tokens.

There may be weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs in the protocols, systems and smart contract in connection with
the Token Sale and/or the Rate3 Ecosystem

The Token Vendor will make reasonable efforts to ensure that the protocols, systems and smart contracts in connection
with the Token Sale and/or the Rate3 Ecosystem are audited, tested and approved by technical experts. However, as
smart contract technology is still in its early stage of development and its application of experimental nature carries
significant operation, technological, financial, regulatory and reputational risks, there are inherent risks that such smart
contracts could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs.

Purchasers of the Tokens should understand and accept that there are no warranties that the Tokens are fit for a
particular purpose or do not contain any weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs which would cause loss in their worth or
value. In the event that any of the aforementioned risks materialises, the Token Vendor's business strategies, results of
operations and outlook may also be adversely affected.

There may be conflicts of interest or risks related to invalidation of transactions

The Token Vendor may be engaged in transactions with related parties and other affiliates, and may continue to
do so in the future. Conflicts of interest may arise as a result, potentially resulting in the undertaking of
transactions on terms that are not on arms’ length.

The Token Vendor may experience system failures, unplanned interruptions in its network or services,
hardware or software defects, security breaches or other causes that could adversely affect the Token
Vendor's infrastructure network, and/or the Rate3 Ecosystem

The Token Vendor is unable to anticipate when there would be occurrences of hacks, cyber-attacks, mining attacks
(including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks and “selfish-mining” attacks),
distributed denials of service or errors, vulnerabilities or defects in the Rate3 Ecosystem, the Tokens, the
Designated Address(es), the Receiving Address(es), the Ethereum Wallet or any technology (including but not
limited to smart contract technology) on which the Token Vendor, the Rate3 Ecosystem, the Tokens, the
Designated Address(es), the Receiving Address(es) and/or the Ethereum Wallet rely or on the Ethereum
Blockchain or any other blockchain. Such events may include, for example, flaws in programming or source code
leading to exploitation or abuse thereof. The Token Vendor may not be able to detect such hacks, mining attacks
(including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks and “selfish-mining” attacks),
cyber-attacks, distributed denials of service errors vulnerabilities or defects in a timely manner, and may not have
sufficient resources to efficiently cope with multiple service incidents happening simultaneously or in rapid
succession.

The Token Vendor's network or services, which would include the Rate3 Ecosystem, could be disrupted by
numerous events, including natural disasters, equipment breakdown, network connectivity downtime, power
losses, or even intentional disruptions of its services, such as disruptions caused by software viruses or attacks by
unauthorised users, some of which are beyond the Token Vendor's control. Although the Token Vendor will be
taking steps against malicious attacks on its appliances or its infrastructure, which are critical for the maintenance
of the Rate3 Ecosystem and its other services, there can be no assurance that cyber-attacks, such as distributed
denials of service, will not be attempted in the future, and that any of the Token Vendor's intended enhanced
security measures will be effective. The Token Vendor may also be prone to attacks on its infrastructure intended
to steal information about its technology, financial data or user information or take other actions that would be
damaging to the Token Vendor and users of the Rate3 Ecosystem. Any significant breach of the Token Vendor's
intended security measures or other disruptions resulting in a compromise of the usability, stability and security of
the Token Vendor's network or services (including the Rate3 Ecosystem) may adversely affect the trading price of
the Tokens.

The Token Vendor is dependent in part on the location and data centre facilities of third parties

The Token Vendor's infrastructure network will be in part established through servers that which it owns and
houses at the location facilities of third parties, and servers that it rents at data centre facilities of third parties. If
the Token Vendor is unable to renew its data facility lease on commercially reasonable terms or at all, the Token
Vendor may be required to transfer its servers to a new data centre facility, and may incur significant costs and
possible service interruption in connection with the relocation.

These facilities are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among others, natural disasters, arson, terrorist
attacks, power losses, and telecommunication failures. Additionally, the third party providers of such facilities may
suffer a breach of security as a result of third party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, and a third
party may obtain unauthorised access to the data in such servers. As techniques used to obtain unauthorised
access to, or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognised until launched against a
target, the Token Vendor and the providers of such facilities may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to
implement adequate preventive measures. Any such security breaches or damages which occur which impact
upon the Token Vendor's infrastructure network and/or the Rate3 Ecosystem may adversely impact the trading
price of the Tokens.

Blockchains may face congestion and transactions may be delayed or lost

Most blockchains used for cryptocurrency' transactions (e.g. Ethereum and Stellar) are prone to periodic congestion
during which transactions can be delayed or lost. Individuals may also intentionally spam the network in an attempt to
gain an advantage in purchasing cryptographic tokens. This may result in a situation where block producers may not
include the purchaser's transaction when the purchaser intends to transact, or the purchaser's transaction may not be
included at all.

The digital wallet may be incompatible with the Tokens

The digital wallet or digital wallet service provider used for the acquisition and storage of the Tokens has to be
technically compatible with the Tokens. The failure to assure this may result in that purchaser of the Tokens not being
able to gain access to his Tokens.

The purchaser may be subject to adverse legal and/or tax implications as a result of the acquisition or transfer of
the Tokens

The legal character of cryptocurrency and cryptographic assets remain uncertain. There is a risk that the Tokens may
be considered securities in certain jurisdictions, or may be considered to be securities in certain jurisdictions in the
future. The Token Vendor does not provide any warranty or guarantee as to how the Tokens will be classified, and each
purchaser will bear all consequences of the Tokens being considered securities in their respective jurisdictions, and
bear the responsibility of the legality, use and transfer of the Tokens in the relevant jurisdictions.

Further, the tax treatment of the acquisition or disposal of such cryptocurrency or cryptographic assets might depend
on whether they are classified as securities, assets, currency or otherwise. As the tax characterisation of the Tokens
remains indeterminate, purchasers must seek their own tax advice in connection with the purchase of the Tokens,
which may result in adverse tax consequences or tax reporting requirements for the purchaser.

As the Tokens may be traded on third-party cryptocurrency exchanges in the future, purchasers may buy or sell the
Tokens on such exchanges. Existing laws on the circulation or transaction of cryptocurrency or cryptographic tokens in
certain jurisdictions may prohibit the transaction or sale of the Tokens in such jurisdictions or to residents of such
jurisdictions. Purchasers must be aware of the restrictions on the secondary trading or external sale of the Tokens and
seek their own legal advice in connection therewith.

RISKS RELATING TO THE DESIGNATED ADDRESS(ES) AND RECEIVING ADDRESS(ES)

The Designated Address(es) and Receiving Address(es) may be compromised and the cryptocurrencies may not
be able to be disbursed

The Designated Address(es) and Receiving Address(es) are designed to be secure. However, in the event that the
Designated Address(es) and Receiving Address(es) are, for any reason compromised (including but not limited to
scenarios of the loss of keys to such Designated Address(es) and Receiving Address(es)), the funds held at the
Designated Address(es) and Receiving Address(es) may not be able to be retrieved and disbursed, and may be
permanently unrecoverable. In such event, even if the Token Sale is successful, the Token Vendor will not be able to
receive the funds raised and the Token Vendor will not be able to utilise such funds for the development of the Rate3
Ecosystem, and the implementation of the Rate3 Ecosystem might be temporarily or permanently curtailed. As such,
distributed Tokens may hold little worth or value, and this would impact their trading price.

The loss or compromise of information relating to your Ethereum Wallet may affect your access and possession of
the Tokens

Your access to the Tokens in your Ethereum Wallet depends on, among other things, the safeguards to the information
to such Ethereum Wallet, including but not limited to the user account information, address, private key and password.
In the event that any of the foregoing is lost or compromised, your access to your Ethereum Wallet may be curtailed
and thereby adversely affecting your access and possession to the Tokens, including such Tokens being unrecoverable
and permanently lost.

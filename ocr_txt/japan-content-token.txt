JCT

Japan Content Token

The first full-fledged utility token project in Japan

Japan Content Token Project, JCT Project, realizes a platform which allows visitors, especially
from overseas, to search and to experience various Japan “contents” by using the blockchain
technology.

There exists virtually no project with this kind of objectives regardless of whether based on the
blockchain technology or not. JCT will create a platform generating totally new values.

This platform will, then, provide to its participants with clear benefits by leveraging three factors
of the blockchain technology, to be described later.

Besides, from the onset, the JCT project will involve experienced business entities as group
companies to leverage the platform and also plans specific affiliations, which will be released

soon.

Moreover, this platform includes a mechanism to minimize the excessive liquidity of tokens in
exchange markets by assuring the siphoning-off of tokens from the market in accordance with
the platform usage. Furthermore, the initial token to be issued will be approximately 30
million, and the token volume will be gradually increased up to 2,500 million over a course of

a decade, by monitoring the platform growth.

This project is led by a management team of entrepreneurs with listing experience of multiple
corporations, with depth of business-development experience, and leading art directors of
Japan. This management team is supported by powerful partners, Cybex, one of the most
influential advocates of the Blockchain industry born in China, and Monstar Lab, Inc., which
holds multiple global R&D centers.

This the JCT project is the first project in Japan, backed by actual businesses, a strong

development system, and a management team with deep experiences.

Market Potential

Though Japan possesses the world’ s richest sightseeing resources and contents, there are
relatively few visitors from overseas and it is yet hard to approach this potentially rich
“contents” for them. Where on earth can we find truly good restaurants and experiences
unique to Japan? There exist obvious gaps. The “contents” covered in the JCT project
include hotels, restaurants, events, experiences, and making things. Not “things” but
“doings” .

In addition, this is a rich market, yet untapped, promised for growth by Japan of mature yet of
large economy, targeting for the citizens of Asia of the most rapidly rising income levels.
Moreover, there will be an Olympic held in Tokyo in 2020, which is one year and half after the
start of actual service offerings by JCT.

Key Business Factors

Key terms to make up the JCT projects are the followings:

* The visitors to Japan reserve “contents”

Issue of tickets, or reservation rights, and generating and managing their future credits

* Platform for ticket distributions: JaCKET

* Tokens serving as fees to perform the ticket distributions and cash assets: JCT token

Management Team

The team started the JCT project holds deep knowledge and accesses to these Japan contents
through the most prominent quality magazine about Japan contents, “DiscoverJapan.”

And besides, the team includes ones who have done in-depth operations about experiencing
through travelling, restaurants, and events, engineers who have led the industry about the
blockchain technology, moreover, ones who have launched several platform businesses, and
prominent venture capitalists who have accumulated success stories on investment. One of

those managing the overall project has founded and listed several corporations of market

capitalizations of over 100 billion yen.

Technological Focus

The JCT platform, amongst Blockchain technology, is characterized by the three following
features: “Records focused on the clarification of the right holders” , “Automated fulfillment of
rights based on “Smart Contracts” , “Increased security level and decentralized management
based on distributed exchange technology” . We believe these three features focus on the
most essentials among blockchain and its related technologies. The JCT project is aiming to

achieve innovative success on each feature.

By also establishing a cooperation structure with Cybex, advanced in distributed exchange
technologies, blockchain will be leveraged on higher level, as well as, by integrating effective
data for the JCT platform into an Oracle, existent off-chains will be tapped in at the same time.
In order to resolve the scalability issues of Ethereum, which will be adopted for JCT tokens, we
plan to shift to a more advanced blockchain technology and assume specifications enabling a
seamless transition.

Benefits of Blockchain Technology

By combining the three key features of the blockchain technology described above, the JCT
project will realize the secondary market of reservation tickets for “contents” . This implies the
possibility of resale. By doing so, the “ticket purchaser” side would be able to make
reservations with minimized considerations for the future uncertainty, and putting the
secondary market in place would also allow the possibility of last-minute reservations. On the
other hand, the “contents” provider side would relish the benefits of business advancements
such as improved convenience of offerings, improved certainty of collections, and improved
lessons for price setting. The JCT project also is aiming to create an economy beyond borders
by leveraging its characteristics of crypto-currency, being able to maintain and to exchange the

values beyond the borders of countries and legal currencies.

Promotion of JCT Token utilization and generation of actual
demands by turning into points

The tokens, which will be issued in the JCT project, into which financers will invest, and which
are planned to be distributed at exchanges, will not only function as various fees, but also plan
to be used as assets to purchase “contents” or as payable compensations for selling
“contents” .

Moreover, in order to encourage the actual demands for JCT tokens, some settlements coming
from distributions on the platform of the JCT project will be made with JCT. JCT, necessary to
establish this settlement, will be automatically bought from the market. This implies that JCT
will be forced to siphon off from the market in accordance with the amount of contents in
distribution, which props up the JCT token distributions. In order to encourage distributions with
JCT, transaction fee margins between settlements by FIAT and JCT will also be established. This

establishment of transaction fee margins would be based on the essential advantage of the

blockchain-based mechanism vs. existent settlement systems such as credit card.

Establishment of Eco-system

In addition, this circulation of JCT tokens will be offered not only to visitors to Japan from
overseas, but also to “contents” providers in Japan. We are also considering localizing the
platform of the JCT project into Japanese language, so that Japanese residents are able to use
the platform as end users as well in the future. Then, an eco-system through JCT tokens will
expand more, and the actual demands for JCT tokens will be expected to grow continuously.
At the same time, in the JCT project, various affiliations for increasing the business volume of

contents on the JCT platform are planned to proceed in the future.

Expansion Strategy for Content Coverage

At the initial stage, the JCT project will be centered on appealing event contents unique to
“DiscoverJapan” . DiscoverJapan is a magazine focused on introducing Japan from various
perspectives, and is a combined media of paper and digital with a decade of establishment as
a position of high-class magazine. On top of this, we will promote partnerships with a number
of restaurants and hotels in Japan, and is aiming to increase the total amount of distribution.
Currently, we are under negotiation with possible external affiliations, which will be released in

turns. Ultimately, we aim to create an environment where each individual would be easily able

to release contents, and to further expand content postings.

Project Phase

This the JCT project will be launched in four phases:
1. From July 2016 to November 2017

Token Allocation and Inhibition of Excessive Liquidity

The JCT project will not raise funds from general investors. All the funds will be raised by the
funding members and their supporters. And tokes allocated to the funding members and the
supporter will be set with step-wise lockups. In doing so, we plan to ensure a step-wise
liquidity in accordance with the JCT platform growth.

Thereby, the ultimate total issue will be 2,500 million; however, the maximum of initial tokens
to be circulated will be approximately 300 million, and thereafter, there will be controlled step-

wise expansions.

Information Disclosure and Business Risk

Blockchain industry. Among JCT members, there exist some entrepreneurs who own
experiences of leading closed corporations to publicly traded corporations, and moreover of
raising them up to the level of a market capitalization of far over 100 billion yen. With these
experiences, we aim at an appropriate information disclosure and at establishment of a
favorable relationship with the community generated by this information disclosure.

As essential to the project, it is necessary to lead the project launch by the operation side
during the initial phase, but the operation side recognizes these risks, and plans to spread

these risks to communities and markets as soon as possible.

Market Potential

JCT

Jopan Content Token

Japan is the country possessing the world’ s richest sightseeing resources and contents.
The number of tourists from overseas to Japan is increasing every year and is expected to
increase further in the future. The Japanese government also predicts 40 million tourists
by the year 2020. In fact, there are relatively few visitors from overseas compared to the
rest of the world and it is yet hard to approach these potentially rich “Japan contents” for

them. There exist obvious gaps.

The JCT project targets on a markets growing precisely because of these existent gaps.
Moreover, we focus on “Japan contents” of “doing = experiencing” including
accommodations — hotels and minsyuku, traditional Japanese inns, cuisines— restaurants,

and experiencing — events and making things, selected in the result of the increased visit

frequencies to Japan and the increased ratios of repeated customers.

Currently, the number of visitors with repeated visits, not the first visit, to Japan are
increasing. As a result, there is a shift from the consumptions of things to the
consumption of doings. Although the opportunities to experience “Japan” itself are

increasing, it is also the fact that Japan is not yet readily available to these expectations.

Japan is the country possessing the world’ s richest sightseeing resources and contents,
and at the same time, is the rich market, yet untapped, promised for growth by Japan of
mature yet of large economy targeting for the citizens of Asia of the most rapidly rising

income levels.

Ticket rights certification

USER

The right to experience “contents” visitors to Japan, which are key business materials for
the JCT project, will be converted into electronic tickets and offered to users as
reservation rights.

By connecting the reservation rights converted into electronic tickets to purchasers’
unique wallets or accounts, the ownership of ticket will be clarified, avoiding foul uses and
property losses. This ticket ownership could also relatively easily be sold and transferred
to the third parties by the user choice.

With these factors in mind, we aim to resolve the ownership issues existent in ticket sales,
as well as to expand the market with enhanced convenience by electronic ticket

conversion

B) Platform for the ticket distributions: JaCKET

JaCKET is a ticket market for experiencing “Japanese culture” , leveraging the
blockchain technologies. JaCKET will provide a place where originators, content
providers, will create rights to experience, to be converted into electronic tickets, and will
sell to foreign visitors and Japanese, wishing to experience attractive Japanese cultures.
Moreover, JaCKET will also provide a platform function as “the secondary market” where
purchased tickets for experience could be transferred and sold with any price within a
predetermined range to acquaintances or to third parties. JaCKET will eliminate the risk
of identification control arisen from foul ticket acquisitions, and will incorporate the
distribution of margins gained at the secondary market to originators, content providers.

In these respects, JaCKET is a revolutionary platform also resolving the issues of resale

markets.

JaCKET signifies “Ja-panese, ti-CKET” . This is not a mere ticket, but is a logo and a
name of the platform, representing both respect to content originators generating tickets,

and approach to end users accessing to these tickets.

C) Tokens serving as fees to perform the ticket distributions and cash assets: “JCT”

token

“JCT" token is a “utility token” revolutionarily changes
the established concepts, and provides marketplace users
with in some ways the ownership of values.

The tokens will be provided with motivations for user
actions in the benefits of users. And it will be used as a

base unit for the whole distribution and fees.

JCT

Japan Content Token

Ms. Galia Benartzihe, the Co-Founder of Bancor Network, stated “The online-economy
uses its own utility tokens. Therefore, the economical growth means the appreciation of
tokens owned by the business involving online-economy with the network growth, which

leads to the possible business expansion, and furthermore, increased profits.” By being
equipped with value transfer as a key function, JCT token is rooted in demand and

supply, the essential to economy.

The JCT logo design represents “red circle” = “rising sun” , calling up an image of the

national flag of Japan, and its “Yen - circle” circulating as a currency.

JCT ran ; , ; ; ; ;
Japon Content Token By utilizing JaCKET platform, ticket outline and information on rights will be recorded on

blockchains. Then, whenever tickets are distributed, whereabouts of the ticket ownership
will be recorded with the transfer of rights, which enables the proof of the right
ownership. JaCKET platform provides ticket authentication mechanism at the content
originator side, and user who are purchasing tickets, or whom these rights are transferred

will be able to check in smoothly at the site of ticket in use.

In addition, capitals collected as ticket fees will be pooled under specific conditions by
Smart Contracts, and allocations of revenue will automatically be executed as the event
comes into effect. As claim owners of revenue would be recorded on blockchains, third
parties would be enabled to purchase the future claims which should be rightfully
received by originators as content providers before the claims are settled. Therefore, the
third parties who have become anew right owner of the future claims could collect as

considerations for the claims.

JaCKET platform emphasizes the recording of this future claim right. Based on this
mechanism, development of services such as early settlement for the future claims are
planned in the future. In addition, several measures to enhance the possibility of holding
contents, subject to tickets are also planned and will be released in turns. As a result,
content originators would be able to collect some capitals before the holding of events,

promoting content development and simplifying content offer, and eventually

speeding-up the JCT economy expansion.

@ Automated fulfillment of rights based on Smart Contracts

CONTENTS HOLDER

HOTEL TICKET Exection of collection

On JaCKET platform, fulfillment of rights by Smart Contracts will be automatically
applied, based on transaction rules set for each registered “event” and “content” . This
enables surely and quickly the reception of ticket sales amount, fee settlement, collection
of cancellation fee, and so forth, which so far used to be of large burdens or risks.
Especially, this would improve drastically the situation in which collections are not
necessarily executed based on a cancellation policy, and would resolves the issues of the

content originators such as hotels and restaurants.

People who can not
go an avant

People who want
to sel tickets

Sales using their own
distribution network

Users who have purchased tickets sold on JaCKET could resell these ticket rights to
acquaintances or to third parties with a newly set distribution price. At this moment,
resale with a higher than the regular price could come into effect, depending on the
contents. At present, even if resale with a higher price comes into effect, there is no
contribution back to content originators. However, on JaCKET platform, if resale with a
higher price comes into effect, additional fees, gradually increasing in accordance with
incremental revenue occurred, will be applied and a certain ratio of them will be allocated

to content originators.

This series of charging of fees and sharing with content originators will be allocated by
Smart Contracts based on predetermined, transparent rules.

Besides, the dead stock of tickets is an extremely serious problem for the content
originators. In addition, on JaCKET, once the period, predetermined as a ticket
information, reaches, the service leveraging Smart Contracts of automatically selling the
ticket rights to the JCT operation will be offered.

This will enable to always collect some amounts if end users made cancellations, which

minimizes the sales risk for originators.

@ Increased security level and decentralized management based on distributed exchange

technologies

Centralized Exchange Distributed Exchange(DEX)

JaCKET market place will, by leveraging the blockchain technologies unique to DEX,
“Cybex” , already proved in distributed exchange operations, enable highly real-time
transfers and verifications of ticket ownerships irrespective of such scalability issues in

Ethereum.

Also, in order for JaCKET to take a more decentralized role, JaCKET marketplace is
aiming to achieve trustless interactions between ticket owners and third parties willing to

purchase tickets in the secondary market.

In order to achieve these three objectives, the JCT project will cooperate with Cybex and
Monstar-lab. The JCT project has researched on various cases of distributed exchanges,
driven by the thoughts that distributed exchange is what the trading platform really
should be like. Then, we selected “Cybex” as our partner, already started distributed
exchange operations, from the standpoints of its technological reliabilities and its
advanced concepts about security, amongst each research subject; we have deepened
our discussions, have signed a tie-up in January, 2018, and have been investigating

together into the innovative product leveraging blockchain.

Moreover, the development of the JCT project is expected to be on a massive scale,
thorough knowledge on business process from ticket purchase to holding events, and
also progressive knowledge on development of off-chain parts are required. Therefore,
the JCT project has selected Monstar Lab, Inc. as a possible partner corporation for such
development; we started our discussions from the beginning of the year 2018, and we
have established a formal structure in April, 2018. Cybex, of progressive knowledge on

blockchain, and Monstar Lab, Inc., of rich experience in business processes, these two

partners will support as the two wheels of the JCT project.

Benefits for the content originators

1) Lower the hurdle to introduce contents of Japan to visitors from overseas
In the past, for content originators, the hurdle used to be extremely high to realize a
series of flow from selling their original contents to people outside Japan, ensuring the

delivery of its right as a ticket, and providing experience in Japan.

JaCKET will provide a platform where it is easily perform a series of procedures of
digitizing tickets by registering content information, of publishing content information to
outside Japan, and of collecting ticket fees, which would enable content originators more

easily to introduce contents toward outside Japan.

3 ) Flexible Design of tickets to adopt to market needs

There are various needs in the content market such as hotels, restaurants, and events,
and the ways of providing contents in the industry used to vary, including old methods
such as paper procedures. And it was not always possible to introduce in responding to
business categories or to substance and advantages of each content.

JaCKET will provide content originators with an attractive mechanism of proofing content
ownership, setting a cancellation fee period, setting ticket, assuming the secondary

market, buying up tickets by JCT operation, and so forth, by designing tickets responding

to these various markets, and flexible and easy for element set-up.

5 ) Distribution of ticket revenues in the secondary market

In the past, the opportunity to receive sales revenue of contents was restricted to only
once for originators. On JaCKET platform will provide content originators with an
extremely appealing mechanism as a contract where if users who purchased tickets resell
to third parties with a higher price, a portion of the revenue will be contributed back to

originators.

Benefits for end users

2 ) Easy access to the valuable and hidden contents in Japan

JaCKET will provide motivations to deliver attractive, valuable contents existent in Japan
to people more proactively seeking contents. By appealing the platform to content
originators, the possibility to encounter contents formerly invisible will increase on
JaCKET, and along with easier settlement, JaCKET will provide simpler access to contents

in Japan.

4) Flexible schedule setting and planning for a trip

In the past, visitors from outside Japan needed to set in advance schedules and plans in
detail. JaCKET will allow flexible trip planning by far with a platform responding to
various forms of usage such as ticket purchase in advance or at the last minute by flexible

ticket designs, and cancellation or resale to third parties of tickets purchased in advance.

6) Automated settlement with extremely high transparency
Events planned during precious trips to Japan are of upmost importance for travelers.
JaCKET will realize high transparency for settlement by the proof of ticket purchase

recorded on blockchains. Therefore, ticket purchasers on JaCKET would not need to

worry about additional settlement or non-settlement.

JCT will establish two types of eco-system using Blockchain.

<Eco-system with JCT token>

Purpose of ERC20 compliant tokens using Smart Contracts on Ethereum network will be
Token Usage issued, and “JCT token — hereafter simply as JCT” will be available throughout
JCT eco-system, centering on JaCKET marketplace.

“JCT" will be mainly used for the following purposes

a.As a settlement method at the purchase of electronic tickets - reservation rights
b.As an alternative to fee settlement at event holdings and content sales

c.As a settlement of sales to event organizers and content sellers

d.As a distribution of award for purchasing tickets

e.As a reward for effective information in the community or for marketing

collaboration

“JCT” will become the core of eco-system by expanding the range of use in the

ICT future. For this reason, we will consider a shift to a new Blockchain technology in
Jopan Content Token the future for real time property by increased speed of transfer, for reduction of
transferring fees, and for up-take of the blockchain technologies ever developing

in the future.

<Eco-system with Cybex ticket contract>

In order to clarify ticket rights, an eco-system leveraging JaCKET market place, hereafter
simply as “JaCKET” , employing the Blockchain proprietary to Cybex of experience in
DEX, distribution exchange system.

“JaCKET will mainly provide the following functions

a.Registering events and posted contents

b.Issuing electronic tickets stating rights of content usages

c.Selling tickets and collecting fees of ticket usages

d.Implementing automatically rights such as revenue allocations by Smart
Contracts

e.Providing an inexpensive settlement system by JCT and FIAT

“JaCKET” will provide a ticket distribution system as a core of JCT economy, and
generate the world market price of contents on JaCKET. In order to do so, we will
proactively proceed with cooperation with existent businesses and other

crypto-currencies, as well as with integration of market data collected and stored
in JaCKET into an Oracle.

Establishment of
Eco-system

JCT

Jopan Content Token

Through the expansion of distributions on JaCKET, by providing attractive Japan
contents, leveraging the strong content networks possessed by the JCT project
members, we will encourage the expansion of actual demands of JCT, and will establish a
trustless network satisfying the supply from the provider side of events and contents, and
the demand from the ticket purchaser side.

Moreover, JCT will also be distributed as an award through the content distribution
process. This distributed JCT will be automatically bought up any time by the market. As
a result, a mechanism to increase the scarcity of JCT in the market, as well as, to always
generate actual demands for tokens along with content distributions, is internalized. This
allows that JCT will always be siphoned off from the market based on rules whenever

content distributions occur.

By improving convenience for providers of events and contents, using JaCKET, these
strategies will have positive impacts on the quality and the volumes of contents posted,
as we as, will promote the increases of the utility value and of the market price of JCT in
use. Besides, by a series of flow of the utility value of JCT being expected to increase
relative to the increase of attractive contents, and JaCKET usage being promoted
through JCT purchase from the market also for ticket purchasers as well, the eco-system
through JCT will expand more and a virtuous circle of ever-growing actual demands for

JCT will be generated. At the same time, the JCT project plans various affiliations for

increasing the business volume on the JCT platform in the future.

In the JCT project, we will expand handling content in 3 steps.

(1) _ Tieing-up with DiscoverJapan
Arranged by DiscoverJapan, the JCT project will be centered on appealing,
Expa nsion unique events. We plan to prepare a number of contents to experience Japan.

Strategy for
(2) Partnering with restaurants, accommodations, experience service businesses
Content Coverage
We will promote partnerships with a number of restaurants and hotels, and business
entities possessing networks with these facilities in Japan, and is aiming to increase the
total amount of distribution. Currently, we are under negotiation with possible

external affiliations and will plan to release in turns.

(3) Posting individual talents
Ultimately, we aim to create an environment where individuals with talents in
Japan would be easily able to post and sell contents. Specifically, chefs, athletes,

craftspeople, artists, personalities, and so forth.

Jonn coment fen What is DiscoverJapan?

In Japan, where there are very few media covering the information on the Japanese
culture, "DiscoverJapan” is the “long-established” magazine with the concept of
“textbook of Japan” , first published in 2008 upon requests from people overseas.
DiscoverJapan has been communicating charms of rich cultures which Japanese people
should be proud of, such as traditional crafts, traditional performing arts, cuisines, and
spiritual features as entertainments suitable for people of today, and has grown as media
of both paper and digital with more than one hundred thousand readers every month.
DiscoverJapan is a powerful media, entrusted projects by the Japanese government and

local governments, uniquely positioned itself, and highly focused on mining contents of

DiscoverJapan covers a wide range of Japanese culture, and has already established
various experiences and events with their sources of interviews and distributions, and with
their networks.By leveraging these networks of DiscoverJapan, initial events being

planned are followings:

Cuisine: Restaurants

We ensure the seats to fully entertain the best of all Japanese cuisines, “Wasyoku” .
We also plan to assist in communications, manners, and etiquets with craftspeople and

chefs.

Experience: Events

There exit many events to experience the Japanese culture. We will prepare events to
taste the best of visits to Japan, such as viewing Sumo wrestling, tasting “Chankonabe” ,
a traditional Japanese hot pod for wrestlers, tea ceremonies, flower arrangement, Judo,

and more...

Accommodations and cultural facilities

We will prepare opportunities to feel historical architectures continued since ancient
times. These opportunities will satisfy not only general travelers, but also inquisitiveness

of people aspired after expertise.

Token Allocation
and Inhibition of
Excessive Liquidity

JCT

Japan Content Token

The total number of JCT issue will be 2500 million. However, as 540 million, equivalent
to 30% of them, will not be issued until the year 2020, the virtual number of the issue
would be 1,250 million for the time being, and as lockups will be set with some rules
for all the tokens except for AirDrops, so the maximum amount of tokens that may be
distributed will be less than 300 million.

As a certain liquidity to JCT is necessary for the success of the JCT project, we anticipate
some distributions will occur after the start of distribution at the JCT token exchange.
However, in order to avoid excessive liquidity, each token is locked up. This lock-up is
planned to offer as a system function.

Although very few, AirDrops, free offerings of JCT, are planned to be divided into three
occasions. The first AirDrop will be in September after the anticipated start of distribution
at the exchange, the second will be at the end of 2018, before the start of distribution at
an additional exchange, and the third will be in the spring of 2019, before the start of
distribution at another additional exchange. Still, as these AirDrops are aiming to improve
the visibility of the JCT project and to secure supporters in the community, we will accept

exceptionally domestic applications.

The detail of the token allocation to each purpose will be as followings:

Token Allocation for establishing the project framework: 17%

We will possess 310 million JCT for using JaCKET and for promoting JCT usage as follows:

Business alliances for gathering contents and ensuring sales capacity of contents
220 million

Entry incentives for promoting entry of content originators

80 million

Expansion of the visibility of JCT and number of owners through AirDrop

10 million

Token Allocation for ensuring necessary funds and initial liquidation for the

ICT project: 43%
We will possess 780 million JCT for alliance strategies in order to realize the expansion of
eco-system, which is the long-run objective of the project, and for ensuring the token

liquidation.

Token Allocation to Funding members and JCT operation team: 10%

The funding members and team members engaged in the JCT project operation will

possess 170 million JCT, equivalent to 10% of the total number.

Token Allocation to secure and adjust liquidity to the market: 30%

We will possess 540 million JCT for securing and adjusting liquidity to the market, as well
as, for the system expansion and improvement along with the expansion of JCT token
economy.

These tokens will not be issued until January, 2020. From January, 2020 onward, the
maximum numbers of 25 million every four months will be issuable. In other words, they
will be issued gradually through ten year time from January, 2020 till the end of 2029.
These tokens aim to buffer possible lack of liquidity as a consequence of forced buy-up of
JCT from the market along with the expansion of JCT token economy as the most
important. However, depending on distributional situation in each JCT exchange, only a

portion of them, or none at all might be issued.

The JCT project team assumes that the expansion of JCT economy would exceed 3%
annually. Therefore, we perceive that additional currency supply of 25 million tokens

every four months, equivalent to 1% of the total number, which amounts to

approximately 3% annually would not suppress unilateral increase of the currency value,
and in other words, there is a high chance that the token price will continue to increase.
Of course, this would be influenced by amount of content distributions and external
environments greatly, and no one can say anything definite, or there are more things
unpredictable. Nevertheless, as issuing additional tokens lawlessly would lead to actions

of missing the token value, as a rule, additional token issue will only be possible with

maximum of 25 million every four months.

Information
Disclosure
and Business Risk

JCT

Jopan Content Token

Team members of the JCT project think that current information disclosures on
crypto-currency in general are not sufficient. On top of obviously information disclosure
on the progress of system development, wouldn’ t it be necessary to disclose information
required to assess business progress of this project, and to be exposed to judgments on

whether it should be discussed how the token value would be assumed?

After the service launch, important points in assessing the value of JCT are how much
contents are using JaCKET platform, and how much contents are distributing.
Particularly, as JCT will be forced to siphon off from the market for settlements of points
and fees whenever contents distribute, it is important to share the amount of content

distribution with the community.

Therefore, the JCT project team will consistently disclose information on the amounts of

content postings and of content distributions.

There also exist some risks as the JCT project is not specialized in developing protocols

on Blockchain, and we will describe these risks as following:

Geographical Concentration

This project places emphasis on providing values from Japan.
Therefore, if tourism and transportations in Japan are thrown into confusion in case of

wars or natural disasters, the execution of this project could be affected.

Operational risk of Launch Period

- Risk involved in content development

Although the value of JaCKET platform is expected to increase in accordance with the
expansion of content coverage, as this is a new project, the amount of content coverage
might not be very large at the start of the project. In order to accelerate the launch, the
operational side plans to provide contents. As a result, until the platform will be
launched, a substantial portion of content offerings would be relied on the operational

side.

: Safety risk of deposits

On JaCKET platform, money paid by end users as a compensation for reservation will be
managed by the operational side until paid to content originators. The operational side
considers money trust or deposit into a SPC account in order to manage these money
safely, but there could be a situation where full bankruptcy remote from the operation

would not be possible.

Legal Risk

In Japan, the legislative system on crypto-currencies are still on work order, and its full

picture is not yet determined. Therefore, depending on the progress and the detail of

the legislative system establishment, the JCT project could possibly be affected.

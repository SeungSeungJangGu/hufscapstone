Abstract

The ability to store and share information digitally offers
so many benefits that the digitization of data has become
aconsistent and growing trend. However, alongside the
advantages of cost and convenience, a new set of concerns
has developed. The ability to copy and share data has
raised questions about the security of personal data.

There have been countless high-profile
hacks and leaks of personal information, as
well as cases where unencrypted data has
simply been lost or left vulnerable to theft.
Some services have been slow adopters
of digital record-keeping, especially where
data is particularly sensitive, such as in
the government and healthcare sectors.
The security risk in these sectors is higher,
and the consequences potentially more
severe, both for the individuals whose data
is lost and for the organizations who have
to deal with the legal and reputational

implications.

“Switching to EHR (Electronic Health
Records) implies a whole new set of
responsibilities and challenges...With
electronic records, there is a higher
risk of compromising sensitive data
because of the possibility of hacking
attacks or unauthorized access...”

Civic is building an ecosystem that
is designed to facilitate on-demand,
secure and low-cost access to identity
verification (“IDV”) services via the
blockchain, such that background
and personal information verification
checks will no longer need to be
undertaken from the ground up every
time. Civic also intends to introduce a
Civic token, or CVC, that participants
in the ecosystem will use to transact
in IDV-related services. Civic hopes
this ecosystem can reduce the overall
costs of IDV, remove inefficiencies,
enhance security and privacy, greatly

improve user experience and disrupt
the current IDV supply chain.

Center for Health Journalism?
Blockchain offers a compelling solution to the problem of
combining accessibility with privacy and security. Records
can be held securely, using end-to-end encryption, and
yet openly authenticated, referenced and documented,
so that data can still be trusted as reliable. This approach
would not even have been possible just five years ago, but
by using modern cryptographic techniques, coupled with
the use of Blockchain technology and smart contracts, this
ideal has now become a reality. This solves the problem
of dealing with highly sensitive or classified information in
away that still enforces all the privacy and confidentiality
rights that consumers and regulators expect.

Background

Financial Regulation

As the execution and administration of financial
transactions has moved progressively into the electronic
realm over the past 50 years, financial institutions,
consumers, and law enforcement have been faced with
new challenges. In the United States, the Bank Secrecy
Act of 1970 (the “BSA”) first required individuals and
financial institutions to keep records that would enable
authorities to detect and prevent money laundering by
verifying the provenance of financial transactions. More
extensive anti-money laundering (“AML”) laws were
introduced in the 1980s, followed in subsequent years
by a series of laws designed to combat financial crime
and certain activities associated with it, including drug
trafficking and terrorism.

The trend was broadly followed in almost every country,
with consumers and businesses growing accustomed to
the need for financial institutions to conduct know your
customer (“KYC”) and IDV processes to verify the identi-
ty of a customer and the authenticity of the information
provided by that customer when seeking access to anew
product or service, for example, when opening a new ac-
count or applying for a loan.

Broader Market Context

Though largely born out of financial regulation, the trend
quickly spilled over into other sectors, particularly in light of
the rise in e-commerce and our increasingly digital lives. Asa
result of this trend towards ever-more extensive collection of
personal information, the overall IDV sector is large and grow-
ing, as are security breaches and data theft.

@ In 2016 alone, 15.4 million adults in the U.S. were
victims of identity fraud, 16% more than in 2015. Vic-
tims suffered losses amounting to $16 billion, almost
$1 billion more than 2015.3

e Globally, almost 1.1 billion identities were stolen in
2016 alone, nearly double the number stolen in 2015.4

e Personal Identity Information (or “PII”) was the most
common form of data stolen, accounting for 42.9%
of data breaches, followed by Personal Financial
Information (“PFI”) at 39.2%, and Personal Health
Information (“PHI”) at 6.8%.

e In 2016, the services industry was most affected by
data breaches, accounting for almost 45% of breaches,
followed by the finance, insurance, and real estate
sectors at 22%.

@ The underground market price for an item of Pll (e.g.,
a name, SSN, or date of birth) can be as little as $0.10
- §1.50. There is also a thriving market for scanned
passports and other documents such as utility bills.

Background

Frictions and inefficiencies in the IDV industry have both
financial and social costs. Without proof of identity, an
individual may be unable to exercise a range of legal
rights, including the ability to vote, access to education
or health care, and receiving social welfare.® As of
January 2016, 1.5 billion people in the developing world
lacked proof of legal identity, including 172 million
children aged 4 and younger.®

Due to a lack of identity documentation and the high

costs of obtaining it, many individuals in the U.S. and

globally are wholly or partially denied access to banking

facilities, resulting in populations of “unbanked” or

“underbanked” individuals. In the U.S., individuals

Background

The Costs of Data Acquisition

Not only are traditional IDV processes often seen as
intrusive or time-consuming by consumers, but they
come at a significant cost to the financial institutions
required to carry them out as a matter of law and to
avoid commercial losses due to fraud.

Compounding these data acquisition challenges are the cultural shifts
that have taken place over recent decades. While it was once the
norm to settle on a career early in life and to remain within the same
organization for many years, if not permanently, it is now common
for individuals to have many jobs and even different careers over
the course of their lives. In the first five years after graduation, those
who graduated between 2006 and 2010 had approximately 2.85 jobs,
compared to just 1.6 jobs for those graduating between 1986 and 1990."

A similar churn is seen in consumer markets, with customers more
likely to switch banks, credit card companies, and energy or internet
providers as new or more cost-efficient options become available.
Greater transparency and access to information has led to greater
competition in both the jobs and utilities markets, along with a
growing demand for IDV, demonstrating that the existing rubber-
stamp methods of bureaucracy that were established in the 1950s
are no longer fit-for-purpose.

Internet-savvy Millennials and Generation Z will be good partners in
this new IDV ecosystem. Millennials are often frustrated by the friction
involved in the banking world, and they will happily swap providers
to simply avoid it.* With this group estimated to spend over $10
trillion over their lifetimes, organizations would be savvy to be more
accommodating of seamless onboarding experiences. Generation Z,
although not price-conscious, is reported to be financially cautious
and supremely interested in value and authenticity, and may respect
amore practical IDV ecosystem.?®

Of course, the cultural revolution inherent in the digitization of
information brings with it another broad trend and set of concerns
in relation to personal privacy.

Privacy concerns arise whenever personal
information is collected, processed, or
stored. There have been many high-profile
hacks, leaks, and thefts of personal data
inrecentyears. The hack of Sony Pictures
in November 2014 demonstrates the
scale of the problem,’ as well as the fact
that hacks are no longer just perpetrated
by individuals and small groups of
hackers. Large amounts of employee
data, including salary information and
personnel records, as well as extensive
email correspondence, movie scripts,
and unreleased films were obtained.

In June 2015, the United States Office of
Personnel Management admitted thatits
systems had been breached,” resulting
in one of the largest ever breaches of
government-held data, with the records
of over 21 million people, including
names, birth dates, addresses, Social
Security Numbers, and even fingerprints,
being stolen.

One of the unintended consequences of
growing awareness and regulation around
personal privacy is that organizations are
now replicating the storage of personal
data on an unprecedented scale,? and
with varying levels of security. This
approach has resulted in many high
profile data breaches, costing billions
of dollars in total. 7°

The |DVindustry has grown up in response
to this changing cultural and regulatory
landscape concerning personal data,
and a number of service providers now
offer easy API access to multiple sources

largely ad hoc approach has resulted in an
outdated, costly, and inefficient system
that serves neither customers nor the
institutions tasked with undertaking IDV.

In many cases, companies are
paying high fees to verify an
individual who was already
verified just hours ago by

the same provider, but for a
different company.

Any system that shares Pll has to take
personal privacy into account. With legacy
KYC systems, maintaining the security of
Pllis a significant concern and regulations
prevent such sharing from occurring in
practice.2+ Some jurisdictions even have
data localization laws that mandate the
physical location of the servers storing
his PIl.22

A transformative solution would allow
organizations to easily obtain proof that
DV information has been authenticated by
a trusted institution without organizations
sharing any PII between them, hence
maintaining the user’s privacy. Ideally the
institution that initially paid a substantial
cost to perform the initial IDV would be
compensated with asmall fee for providing
this proof, thereby incentivizing both
institutions to participate. This would
lower the overall cost of KYC, thereby
disrupting the entire IDV supply chain.
Blockchain technology and in particular
smart contract functionality is ideally
suited to this application.

Blockchain

The suite of technologies known as blockchain or distributed ledgers that have emerged in recent years offers a qualitatively
different solution to the problems faced by organizations in the process of conducting IDV on their customers. In particular,
smart contracts, or code executed on the blockchain, bring significant advantages over existing applications and frameworks
of thinking. The following is an overview of those technologies. Open blockchains like Bitcoin have a number of properties that
set them apart from the centralized databases typically used to record information. While they cannot be considered uniformly
better or worse in general, their relative advantages include:

Low-cost

With no middlemen to impose
uncompetitive fees and with a
reward mechanism built into the
protocol, transfers require only small
transaction fees.

Irreversibility

Because the ledger is immutable, a
transfer that has been accepted into
the network cannot be reversed.
With no trusted intermediary to
act on behalf of users or control
the movement of their funds,
bitcoin transactions are immune
to chargebacks and are like paying
in physical cash, but online.

Immutability

The ledger is policed by every member
of the network and its integrity
checked and agreed by the network
as a whole on an ongoing basis. Any
changes that one or other party
attempts to make to the blockchain
are recognized and rejected by the
majority.

Pseudonymity

Blockchain addresses are effectively
just strings of random characters that
cannot intrinsically be associated
with a specific individual. While it
is easy for the owner to prove they
control an address if they wish, and
it is often possible to build up a
picture of transaction relationships
due to the transparent nature of the
blockchain, the address itself does
not contain the owner’s PII. Assuming
best practice, this enables a high
degree of privacy when required.

ro’

Transparency

Everything that takes place on the
ledger is visible to anyone. It is
possible to see everything that has
ever been recorded on the blockchain.

(a

Security

Because the blockchain is maintained
by a large network of participants,
no one actor can easily gain enough
influence to submit a fraudulent
transaction or successfully alter
recorded data. Although possible
in theory with enough resources,
it would be prohibitively expensive
in practice. The more valuable
the token, the larger the network
and the more resources would be
required, meaning that the cost
always outpaces the benefit.

Blockchain

Bitcoin

In its early years, blockchain was
synonymous with bitcoin, the peer-to-
peer currency launched in January of
2009 as blockchain’s first application.”
Bitcoin’s innovation was solving the
so-called ‘double-spend’ problem in
online financial transfers: the issue
that data is readily copied, and that it
is therefore impossible to prevent the
same funds from being sent to more
than one recipient unless there is a
trusted intermediary to keep accounts.
This centralized model was used by all
banks and payment processors who
dealt with electronic funds transfers.

Such a centralized approach always
involves trust, because there must be an
authority whose job it is to organize the
transfer of money from one account to
another. In the physical world, money
is handed over directly from person to
person. Online, however, there must be
intermediaries. Rather than transferring
funds from their account directly to
the recipient, the user instructs the
intermediary to move funds on the
user’s behalf.

This centralized system has a number
of potential drawbacks. The trusted
intermediary may prove untrustworthy,
has control over the end user’s funds,
and can unilaterally block or reverse
transactions. The centralized nature of
online banking and other online money
transfer protocols leaves users vulnerable
to intervention by these gatekeepers
and comes with security risks, because
there is always a single point of failure.
Centralized databases can be hacked,
and their administrators compromised
or coerced by a range of actors.

Bitcoin’s innovation was a system that
allowed peer-to-peer online transfers of
value for the first time ever. No trusted
intermediary was necessary, thereby

mitigating the single point of failure
problem. Instead of the centralized
accounting used by traditional payment
processors, the blockchain is a shared
ledger. While centralized systems are
restricted and can only be accessed by
trusted intermediaries, anyone can access
the decentralized bitcoin blockchain
directly. Similarly, it is maintained by
the whole network, rather than security
being tasked to the trusted authority.

This innovation was achieved by
contriving a system in which itis difficult
to add transactions to the ledger, but
easy for anyone to check whether they
are valid - that is, if the funds being
transferred really belong to the transferor
in the first place. The difficulty (from the
standpoint of computational resources)
means that there is a cost involved in
attempting to process transactions and
rewards (in the form of new bitcoins and
transaction fees) for doing so legitimately.

Fraudulent transactions are quickly
identified and discarded from the
ledger. Attempting to add a fraudulent
transaction is costly, entails foregoing
the financial incentives for acting
honestly, and is highly unlikely to succeed
in the first place because no single party
in the overall network has more than a
small proportion of the overall ‘authority’
to validate transactions. In practice, it
is simpler and more profitable to act
honestly and so there is little point
attempting to double-spend funds.

Smart contracts

The bitcoin blockchain was designed
for peer-to-peer online transfers of
value, effectively acting as digital cash.
It achieves this not by actually moving
money from one address to another, but
by maintaining and updating the ledger

Copyright © 2017 Civic Technologies, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

to reflect how much money is registered
to each address. The same approach to
recording data transparently, securely,
and immutably by consensus of the
entire network can be extended to many
other applications (since the financial
value in the bitcoin network is simply
information about who owns what). For
example, messages can be stored on the
blockchain, either encrypted orin plain
text. Additionally, secondary tokens
representing assets, such as shares in a
business, securities, commodities, and
other currencies, can be secured on the
original blockchain.

Itis also possible to create a system that
takes a similar approach to the execution
of computer code. Smart contracts are
code that is executed on the blockchain.
Software is typically run on a single
computer or centralized server, just as
online money transfers are typically
centralized, for the reasons explained
above. However, it is now possible to
extend the blockchain’s functionality
to software, creating decentralized
applications or “dApps.” Once uploaded
to the blockchain, these are stored
immutably and run when the required
conditions are met.

The most famous smart contracts
platform is Ethereum, which was
launched in 2016 after a highly successful
crowdfund in the summer of 2015.75
Ethereum, which has become extremely
well-known in the cryptocurrency world
due to its soaring value, as well as some
high-profile problems including The DAO
and the ensuing controversial hard fork,26
is a completely new platform, coded
from scratch. Although other smart
contracts and dApps platforms have
been created, including Lisk,2” none
have had the popularity and prominence
of Ethereum.

Blockchain

Rootstock

Early versions of the bitcoin soft-
ware included more extensive fun-
ctionality than simple payment,
and the scripting language allowed
for more complex operations, until
these were removed in 2010 due to
the potential vulnerabilities they
introduced.

Since then, there have been numerous
initiatives to bring ‘2.0’ functionality to
the bitcoin blockchain in various ways.
Rather than these features being included
in the core, they have been created as
platforms operating as a layer built on
top of the bitcoin network, for reasons
that include:

Security

The bitcoin network is the largest and
most secure cryptocurrency network.
No other platform has the hashrate or
history of bitcoin.

v) Popularity

Bitcoin has more users and
community members than

any other platform by an order of
magnitude over competing networks.

Awareness

Bitcoin is better known than
newer platforms that have not yet
established the same profile.

Rootstock (or “RSK”), one such layer on
top of the bitcoin network, is asecure and
scalable smart contracts solution that
supports the existing bitcoin ecosystem.

The bitcoin network requires that
transaction fees are paid in the native
currency of bitcoin (or “BTC”), including
any smart contracts or other ‘2.0’ activity
secured on the bitcoin blockchain.
Similarly, the Ethereum network requires
the use of its native currency, Ethereum
(or “ETH”) as gas. Fees for executing
smart contracts on Rootstock, however,
are paid in smart BTC, which has a one-
to-one peg with BTC.

RSKalso allows for the creation of separate
blockchain tokens. As noted above, these
tokens are digital assets, cryptographically
secured upon the blockchain, which can
represent whatever the issuer wants and is
prepared to back (if necessary), and which
can play whatever role in the ecosystem
thatits rule-set determines. These tokens
can be transferred on a peer-to-peer basis
for a minimal transaction fee, just like
native tokens (e.g., BTC in the bitcoin
protocol and ETH on Ethereum). They
can be incorporated into smart contracts
as an integral part of the ecosystem.

‘As RSK does not mint, nor has pre-mined
coins, then it has no speculative value
and does not compete with Bitcoin’ 7°

28 Bitcoin was first articulated in 2008, on the Cryptography
Mailing List, see http://www.metzdowd.com/mailman/listinfo/
cryptography and in a white paper published by Satoshi Naka-
moto, see https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf. Satoshi Nakamoto is
widely accepted to be a pseudonym for an individual or group
of people who created bitcoin. Despite numerous theories
and news headlines to the contrary, Nakamoto’s true identity
remains unknown to the public.

24 This is often expressed in terms of a ‘51% attack’. That is, an
attacker would require over half of the computational resources
of the entire bitcoin network in order to create a fraudulent
transaction.

25 Ethereum’s crowdfund collected 30,000 BTC, then worth around
$16 million. At the time of writing, the platform has a market
cap of over $17 billion.

26 The DAO (Distributed Autonomous Organization) took a smart
contracts approach to investment. Decisions about which pro-
jects to fund were intended to be taken collectively by investors,
and funds dispersed automatically. However, a hacker was able
to exploit a loophole in The DAO’s smart contracts and drain
tens of millions of dollars from the pool of invested funds.

27 Lisk grossed $5.5 million in its crowdsale in 2016.

Description

The IDV industry as it presently exists
relies on each institution obtaining
and keeping records of clients’ Pll. As
discussed, there are both significant
overheads and security risks to this
approach. Civic, already a trusted player
in the IDV space, intends to leverage
the above-described innovations
in blockchain and smart contracts
technologies to build on its success to
date to introduce a “2.0” version of its own
ecosystem. The key innovation enabled
by this blockchain-based approach is
the efficient and secure verification of
previously-audited Pll by third parties
without the need to share the underlying
Pil between those parties, retaining User
control over the data.

The following is a description of Civic’s
existing identity products and services,
which will act as foundational elements
of, and reference implementation for,
the new product that Civic now intends
to introduce.

Civic’s existing identity
products and services

At present, Civic provides a digital identity
platform known as the Civic Secure
Identity Platform (the “SIP”), which
individuals can access by downloading
the Civic Secure Identity App (the “Civic
App”), setting up their digital identity
on the their device, and verifying their
identity to become a Civic user. The Civic
App stores a user’s PII securely on the
user’s phone using high-level encryption
and biometric locks (such as a fingerprint
ID). By keeping this data in the user’s
control, the Civic App makes it harder
for hackers and other malicious groups
to gain access to a user’s information.

Through its decentralized architecture
with the blockchain and biometrics on
the mobile device, the CivicApp enables
users to share and manage their fully
verified identity data. Initially the user
captures their Pll as requested into the
Civic App which then goes through a
thorough verification process by Civic.
Once fully verified, the attestations to
this data are written by Civic to the
blockchain which can then be used
by recipients of the data to verify the
PIl’s authenticity and ownership.

Civic’s identity partners can request
a user’s information through custom
QR codes to be scanned by the user
with the Civic App. Once a user has
unlocked the Civic App with his or
her biometrics, the user can scan
these codes, review exactly which
information is being requested, and
choose whether to approve or deny
the request.

Thus, the SIP allows for a voluntary
information exchange between the user
and the identity requestor, according
to requirements set by the requestor.
In this way, the SIP allows for real-time
authentication of identity data verified
by Civic or a Civic identity partner and
secure sharing of that data.

services to develop a fully decentralized
Civic ecosystem for IDV services (the
“Ecosystem”). The Ecosystem will consist
of three new components: (1) a variety
of smart contracts; (2) an indigenous
utility token known as the Civic token or
“CVC”; and (3) new software applications,
introduced by Civic and others, that
allow participants to interact within the
Ecosystem.

Civic’s Ecosystem will be designed to
incentivize participation by trustworthy IDV
providers known as “Validators,” who may
include financial institutions, government
entities, and utility companies, among
others.*° Just as Civic currently validates
the identity information of users of the
Civic App, Validators will be able to verify
the identity of an individual or business,
known as a “User,” and ‘stamp’ this
approval on the blockchain in the form
of a record known as an “attestation.”
Such attestation is effectively the hash of
an underlying element of Pll, plus certain
metadata relating to that hashed element
(as further described below). Parties
known as “Service Providers” who are
seeking to verify the same information
about a given User, and who may include
other Validators, would no longer need
to independently verify that information
and could instead leverage the work
already performed by trusted Validators.

Civic intends for this kind of robust and
decentralized IDV Ecosystem to emerge
through the use of smart contracts,

contracts, a high degree of scalability,
and near instant transactions.*! The
ecosystem is intended to ensure that
Users remain in complete control over
their Pll, by requiring the User’s consent
before the IDV transaction between the
Validator and the Service Provider can
be completed.

The smart contracts will enable Validators
to offer their attestations for sale to
Service Providers (subject to obtaining the
User’s approval), and Service Providers to
determine which Validators are offering
attestations and at what price. Each
Validator can publish a price at which
it is prepared to sell its attestation of
a User’s PII. Prices can be updated by
Validators at any time, but any such
updates will take a minimum of the time
taken for the validation of a transaction on
Rootstock (typically about 10 seconds) to
appear. Prices can be offered for existing
attestations and new attestations to be
made.

Once the Validator, Service Provider and
User all sign-off on the transaction via
the smart contract system, the Service
Provider will pay the Validator in CVC.
The smart contract will then allocate a
set portion of the paid CVC to the User
to incentivize User participation in the
Ecosystem. Users will be able to use their
CVC to purchase identity-related products
and services from Civic, including some or
all of the products and services currently
available (as described below). Civic
envisions that other service providers
will also make their identity-related
products and services available through
the Ecosystem, and that Users will use
their CVC to obtain those third-party
offerings.

In addition to the RSK or other smart
contracts, the Civic ecosystem will also
include Civic’s existing Civic App (through
which Userswill share their Pll with chosen
Validators and consent to transactions
by interacting with the smart contracts),
and additional software to be developed
by Civic (and others) through which
Validators and Service Providers will
themselves be able to interact with the
smart contracts. While Civic intends to
develop the initial smart contracts and
software, the Ecosystem is intentionally
open to third-party providers.

The Users will store their data on a
personal device using the Civic App, and
optionally backed up toa personal account
ona cloud-based or distributed storage
platform.*? Civic will not handle the
storage of the data in this form, not least
due to the regulatory implications of being
responsible for this information; different
jurisdictions have varying approaches to
data storage, and some require that Pll
is stored in the same country as the User
(where storage is dealt with by a third party
such asa financial institution). For Civic’s
contemplated Ecosystem, it is enough
that Validators have access to the data
they require, with the permission of the
User. This approach has the additional
benefit of decentralizing data storage,
shifting the responsibility onto the User
who has to prove ownership, which is
ultimately through each User’s device.**

30 In the financial services sector, this typically means banks and oth-
er financial organizations carrying out Know Your Customer (‘KYC’)
processes, but Identity Verification is a broader trend that takes many
forms, according toned. These entities will be able to verify theiden-
tity of an individual or business (a ‘User’) and ‘stamp’ this approval on
a blockchain. Through the use of smart contracts, built on RSK (Root-
stock) and the bitcoin blockchain, a robust and decentralized identity
verification ecosystem will emerge, in which Pll and other sensitive
data can be exchanged securely and privately. 31 Subject to the avail-
ability of all necessary features on the Rootstock platform. 32 Or any
subsequently developed app available in the Ecosystem for this pur-
pose. 33 This will be subject to the availability of the cloud services
and to the requirements of the country laws applicable to the Users
34 Depending on the regulatory environment for Users, there is also
the option of storing data using InterPlanetary File System (“IPFS”),
which will be explored in future iterations of the project and has many
benefits outside of just backing up the data. This is however outside
the scope of this paper. IPFS is a protocol designed to create a per-
manent and decentralized method of storing and sharing files. Itis a
content-addressable, peer-to-peer hypermedia distribution protocol.
Nodes in the IPFS network form a distributed file system, see https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System.

Civic’s planned

identity ecosystem

The mechanics of attestation

The Pll that is stored on a User’s device can be attested to by
Validators. The user can share the Pll and any attestations
with any other participants in the Ecosystem that trust a given
Validator. An attestation gives a participant confidence in the
adequacy of the process used to verify specific fields of PIl with
potentially greater efficiency and lower costs.

A User’s Pll is structured in a hierarchy, with elements like SSN,
address, city, country, and date of birth, among others. This
data follows a defined model and Civic’s intention is to follow
industry standards where they exist, and even contribute to
further standardization in the industry.

The provability of an attestation is achieved by organizing the data
into a Merkle tree,*> where each node representing an element
of Pll (e.g., name) contains a hash of its content and a hash of the
hashes of its child nodes (e.g., first name and last name). This
results in a “root hash” (also known as the Merkle Root) that can
be used as a fingerprint for the data being attested to. This root
hash is recorded in the blockchain and signed by the Validator
making the attestation as to that specific Pll. Arbitrary numbers
known as “nonces” are used to randomize hashes on structured
data that have a relatively small universe of possible values to
minimize the risk of any hash being reversed. Should the User
not wish to reveal all of the underlying Pll that was attested
to, portions of the Merkle tree can selectively be revealed, and
hashes provided for any elements the User prefers not to reveal.

This structure has two advantages: (1) it enhances User control
by allowing the User to selectively reveal pieces of personal
information in different circumstances; and (2) promotes security
by using properties of the blockchain to prove that the data have
not been tampered with after an attestation has been made.

The only way for a participant to reproduce the hash is to create
it from the original data. This allows the User to share the data
with another participant in the Ecosystem and to prove that it is
the same data that was previously attested to by the Validator.
Should the Validator revoke its attestation for any reason, this
can be reflected on the associated blockchain transaction, but
the details of the attestation can never otherwise be changed.
The blockchain on which these transactions are recorded is
currently the bitcoin blockchain, because of its proven integrity
and wide adoption, but the same design could equally be used
on any other blockchain platform.

Copyright © 2017 Civic Technologies, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

The method used for recording these attestations is
to create derived addresses where small amounts of
cryptocurrency can be spent. The root hash is converted
to a valid blockchain address using the additive property
of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC):

Kprivth = kattest

designed in a way that makes it unfeasible to determine
the User and Validator associated with the address. This
is essential to protecting the privacy of participants.

Allowing entities to sell their attestations but not the
underlying data, would turn the IDV market on its head.
Entities who have invested heavily in IDV and KYC processes
and built large, verified customer bases would be able to
transform these once costly activities (i.e., customer IDV
and KYC) into revenue generators, all without selling or
transferring any customer PIl.

Through this design, Civic aims to
address the needs of:

Service Providers, by lowering their
costs of verifying the identity of an
individual or entity from scratch.

Validators, by enabling them to
recoup the costs of the identity
verifications they perform and the
attestations they provide.

Users, by granting them rights to
view or amend, and control who
has access to, their data directly.
The CVC that Users receive for
participation will be reusable within
the Civic ecosystem to obtain other
identity-related services from Civic
or ecosystem participants.

Governments, by allowing
departments or agencies to rely
upon each other’s attestations of
identity with the express consent
of a User.

Ecosystem token (CVC

Civic intends to introduce a Civic token,
or CVC, which will be used as a form of
settlement between participants to an
identity-related transaction within the
Ecosystem. The CVC paid in a transaction
is distributed to the Validator and the
User as a reward for sharing information.
The proportion in which they share the
CVC is defined by the smart contract
and can be adjusted by consensus of
the Ecosystem participants.

CVC will also provide a means to
incentivize all participants, including
Users, to contribute to the Ecosystem.
Moreover, Civic anticipates that the
Ecosystem will develop such that Civic
and third-party providers of identity-
related products and services will offer
those products and services to Ecosystem
participants in exchange for CVC.

Civic Users who own CVC may be able
to use their CVC to purchase existing
services directly from Civic. Civic may
also build additional identity-focused
services that can be exchanged for
tokens, including:

@ Services to run personal background
checks;

® Blockchain notary services which
would allow identity and document
authenticity to be provable;

© Dark web monitoring and searches;
e Access to individual credit reports; and
@ Peer-to-peer identity services.

A fixed supply of CVC will be created
during a token sale, with no mechanism
for supply to be increased. A ledger will

be maintained for CVC*®* and will follow
the ERC20 standard. The ledger will

Using a dedicated token, the CVC,
to facilitate transactions in the Civic
Ecosystem provides a number of
advantages over the use of existing
tokens, including that:

e It can be used across any number of
jurisdictions, retaining a single uniform
method of settlement;

@ Usingablockchain-based token makes
it possible to perform settlements
automatically and irrefutably within
a smart contract;

@ Having a unique, specialized token for
accessing identity services provides
stability and shields the Ecosystem
from extraneous considerations that
can make other cryptocurrencies
volatile;

e It makes it possible to manage
incentives in a way that drives
Ecosystem effects for the benefit of
all participants in the Ecosystem (as
further described below).

A market for efficient
attestation of User data

Building on the distributed data model, the attestation model, and
the CVC token, Civic will provide a platform for attestations to be
shared between IDV service providers in order to radically reduce
costs, compensate participants in the Ecosystem, and keep Users in
full control of their data. The following diagram and process map gives
an example of an initial attestation by a Validator, in this case Service
Provider A, and the purchase of this attestation by a second service
provider, Service Provider B, who is seeking to rely upon Service Pro-
vider A’s attestation. For purposes of this reference implementation,
we assume that the User is using the Civic App.37

the User, through his/her Civic App,39 can send Service
Provider B the Pll with the requested content in plain text.

40 Once supplied to another party, the use and storage of User Pll by
that party is governed by the specific contractual agreement (e.g.,
applicable terms and conditions or terms of service) by which the
User provides his/her Pll, and not by the Civic Ecosystem.

41 If this is the case, IPFS can become the data storage layer for
identity data, and not just the backup for the users device. See supra
note 39.

To maintain the highest level of privacy,
Pll must be controlled by the User at
all times and be stored locally on their
device. This physical separation creates
a particularly difficult path to data theft
as individual devices need to be targeted
on a person by person basis in order to
steal Pll, and prevents the types of mass
data breaches to which we have become
accustomed. It also allows early adopters
of the Civic Ecosystem to store a much
more limited amount of sensitive data
and still have a high level of certainty
about the authenticity of the actors
they are dealing with. Moreover, when a
User’s Pll is shared with other parties, it
is always shared directly by the User via
a peer-to-peer protocol for this sharing,
promoting compliance with privacy and
data protection regulations in even the
strictest jurisdictions.”

However, as adoption grows, the value of
specific identity attributes on the black
market should decline as entities move

away from mere data points being used
to transact and move towards verification
of ownership before a transaction takes
place. For example, credit card details have
black market value because transactions
can take place simply with knowledge of
the data. Once a credit card number has
to be presented with blockchain-based
proof that the user indeed owns that
number, the value of simply having those
details progressively deteriorates with
adoption of the Ecosystem.

At this juncture it is less important where
the data is stored and rather that the
ownership proofs are protected. It
currently makes sense for distributed
data models to be easily adopted ina more
sensitive environment. The benefit here is
that large organizations can leverage the
efficiencies of permissioned distributed
data storage for things like Pll, which has
the added benefit of always having the
latest data that the User has permissioned
the organization to access.

Conclusion

Civic is proposing the creation
of a new Ecosystem that will
improve efficiencies and reduce
the costs of the existing IDV industry.
Organizations that have invested
heavily in IDV services will have
the opportunity to monetize their
processes both inside and outside
their core business areas. These
reduced costs and ease of access to
verifiable Users will likely encourage
organizations to improve their
processes to help combat fraud
and deliver better services.

For end Users, the longer term
impact of this disruption should
be greater privacy and control of
their Pll and other sensitive data.
Access to services will be faster and
more seamless and Users will be
able trust more readily the services
they are using. Simply through
participation in the Ecosystem
Users will earn tokens which will
allow them access to a vast array of.
useful services that will ultimately
help them protect and control their
identity.

At scale it will no longer be enough
to simply have PII to commit
identity fraud, but proof of data
hip will be required as well.
izations will be able to trust
's without the need to retrieve
store unnecessary data. This
aradigm will ultimately
ice the risk of data breaches
dramatically increase the cost

of committing fraud.

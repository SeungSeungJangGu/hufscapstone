MaxiMine Whitepaper Draft v.1.1.1

1. Background

In early 2009, the genesis block of the Bitcoin network was mined by Satoshi Nakamoto, launching
Bitcoin into existence with the release of the first open source client and the issuance of the first
Bitcoins. Since then, Bitcoin has seen tremendous growth and following, from being a niche currency
used only in very small circles, to worldwide adoption and publicity in mainstream media. One of the
key driving factors for its success lies within its innovative usage of cryptography in its underlying
technology through a process known as “mining”.

1.1 Mining Industry

Mining refers to the process of adding new transactional records to Bitcoin’s distributed public ledger.
The ledger itself is known as the blockchain because transactional records are packaged into blocks
before being linked together as a database.

The blockchain is used to confirm that transactions carried out within the network are verified. It also
serves to testify towards the authenticity and legitimacy of individual transactions to prevent a
potential case of “double-spending”.

1.2 Proof-of-Work

Proof-of-work refers to the concept used to define the requirement for the generation of a new set of
transactions to be added to the distributed transaction database. Every set of transactions is packaged
into a block containing a block header. The block header contains a short string of meaningless data —
called a nonce — attached to them. Mining computers are required to search for the right meaningless
string such that the block as a whole satisfies a certain arbitrary condition. For Bitcoin, it is required
that the SHA-256 hash of the block will have a certain number of leading zeros.

The popularity of Bitcoin has also raised the visibility of the proof-of-work consensus algorithm, with
many other early cryptocurrencies adopting it in their technological stack and making a myriad of
improvements and modifications to it.

1.3 Equipment

In the early days, the primary form of mining placed emphasis on CPUs and GPUs. However, as
cryptocurrency mining became more and more profitable, Application Specific Integrated Circuits
(ASICs) were designed for the sole purpose of mining and were more efficient than traditional
hardware by an order of magnitude. These specialized devices were not only more powerful than GPU
miners, they also consumed less electricity and thereby incurred less cost for the miner, ultimately
increasing their profit margins.

Page | 4
MaxiMine Whitepaper Draft v.1.1.1

2. Problem

Despite the profitability of mining, high barriers-to-entry exist in this industry, preventing most people
from taking part in it. Initially, the only way to get into cryptocurrency mining was to be an
independent miner and purchase and configure equipment to mine. This system proved to be
effective for most individuals who had both the technical expertise and capital to manage their own
mining equipment. As the industry progressed, coordinated efforts proved to be significantly more
effective than independent mining and key players were quickly able to dominate the mining industry.
Efforts to lower the difficulty and increase adoption and participation, combined with the widespread
adoption of cryptocurrencies resulted in an infrastructure known as “cloud mining”. Cloud mining
allowed firms to set up mining farms and rent out hashing power at a cost to individuals, increasing
participation of lower skilled miners.

Today, both independent and cloud mining are provided as options for retail investors and miners
alike, each with their own set of advantages and disadvantages.

2.1 Independent Mining

Independent mining can produce very high returns if the owner is experienced and the equipment is
well maintained. However, the skills needed to set up and configure the mining rigs may prove difficult
to individuals who lack a complimentary background. In addition to that, external factors out of their
control such as electrical fees and climate could negatively impact the returns from mining.

2.1.1 Getting Equipment

The purchasing process of cryptocurrency mining equipment is usually the first challenge faced by
aspiring miners. Procuring ASICs directly from Bitmain or other manufacturers is an unpredictable
process as the stock is usually sold out within a very short period of time and delivery times may turn
out to be longer than advertised. The low supply of ASICs and a strong monopoly in the manufacturing
of such equipment also causes prices to soar in the secondary market, with listings as high as two to
three times of the retail prices. Attempts to purchase graphics cards to construct mining rigs for
cryptocurrencies without ASIC mining capabilities prove to be equally challenging due to similar
problems in supply and demand.

2.1.2 Expertise and Skill

Even if an independent miner is able to receive the equipment needed for mining, a high level of
expertise and skill is required to configure the equipment and ensure maximum efficiency and output
of the equipment. Optimization is especially challenging due to the additional factors for consideration,
such as the increased heat output from the overclocking process. Any mistake made could potentially
damage the equipment and reduce the output and efficiency of the capital spent.

2.1.3 Climate and Electricity

External factors outside the control of the miner are able to heavily impact the returns from mining,
with the two most important factors being climate and electrical cost. In this regard, climate refers
mainly to the temperature and humidity of the mining farm. An ideal climate would be a cold and dry
one as a cold climate offsets the high heat dissipated by the mining rig and a humid climate would
damage the equipment if they are exposed. Electrical costs generally account for over 30% of the
running cost for operating a mining farm and if the rates per kilowatt hour is high, the profit margins
from mining would be reduced drastically.

Page |5
MaxiMine Whitepaper Draft v.1.1.1

2.1.4 Sunk Cost for Equipment

Purchasing and owning equipment results in a high sunk cost involved in the initial capital commitment
as some of the equipment such as ASICs are heavily specialized and are difficult to liquidate after using
them. Some manufacturers and resellers have also defined rules against equipment that has been
used for mining as their lifespan would be reduced drastically in the process.

2.2 Cloud Mining

Remote hosting and cloud-based mining helps reduces the cost and barrier to entry for investors and
provides access to the same mining capabilities for mining rewards. However, a different set of
problems and issues can arise from cloud mining due to the lack of ownership over the equipment.

2.2.1 Risk of Fraud

For cloud mining, hashing power is generally purchased through mining contracts in place of buying
the actual equipment. This brings about additional risk as investors often do not get to see the mining
rigs or farm, making it a very common way to run Ponzi schemes. Since the funds are committed up
front, in the event of liquidation of the cloud mining farm or service, investors would get nothing in
return as they are paying for the service and agreeing to no ownership over any of the underlying
assets and equipment.

2.2.2 Perpetual Recurring Cost

The requirement to purchase contracts for mining duration would eventually add up to a high amount
of recurring cost due to the lack of ownership over the equipment and assets. This means that if the
investor plans to mine for a prolonged period of time, the profit margin would be lower unless the
cloud mining company reduces their fee structure. For miners who own the equipment, the profit
margin would increase once the rig has earned more than its cost.

2.2.3 Lack of Transparency and Control

Cloud mining services are fully owned by the service provider and the processes and calculations are
generally not made public and non-transparent. Mining service providers can also charge hidden fees
such as through the absorption or under declaration of the transaction fees collected from each block.
Service providers are also free to modify their pricing as they deem fit, resulting in a business model
that may not be very beneficial to investors purchasing and renewing short term contracts.

3. MaxiMine

In view of the challenges in the industry, MaxiMine proposes a decentralized cloud mining pool based
on blockchain technology to provide an open, fair, accessible and transparent mining pool for
investors. Investors will also be able to benefit from the overall services based on the rich experiences
and resources of the founders and team members. Although it is a cloud mining service, the main
differentiating factor for MaxiMine is the staking process, instead of a traditional fixed cost and
payment, investors are required to deposit capital for the duration of the mining contract, resulting in
minimal capital loss incurred in mining.

3.1 Introduction and Location

MaxiMine leverages on a few key resources that provide a strong competitive edge in the industry
while bringing high value to its investors. The wealth of experience amassed by the founding team
members expands on the deep knowledge and understanding they have in both cryptocurrency
mining and business management. The deep ties and strong partnerships that they have forged are
also used to enable strategic value through networks and connections. Over the years, the team has
devised innovative means to optimize and improve the mining process and increase the returns and
output of any mining farm.

MaxiMine has its technology headquarters in the United States. Its first batch of mining farms will be
located in several countries, with the largest one in Xinjiang, Northern China.

Mining Farm

The most efficient and effective mining rigs are manufactured in China, along with all the parts
required in servicing. Over 60% of the global hashing power is generated in this country and it has
proven itself as an industry leader attracting the best talent and resources into its mining community.

Situating a flagship mining farm in Northern China would therefore bring about a number of benefits
and geographical advantages such as a reduction on foreign exchange risk as the primary currency
utilized in both the farm and in dealing with vendors. Time and resources consumed in transport and
logistics are also reduced due to the closer proximity to key suppliers and partners.

MaxiMine Whitepaper Draft v.1.1.1

3.2 Climate and Power

Situating the mining farm in Xinjiang brings about benefits that can reduce operational overhead. The
vast expanse of land combined with a low population allows for land and labour costs to be among
the lowest in the world.

In addition, the area has significant power wastage resulting in extremely low electrical fees of about
28 cents CNY (4 cents USD) per kWh. With a local steppe climate and an average annual temperature
of 13.2 degrees Celsius, cost savings are also accrued in the reduced machine and farm cooling costs.

3.3 Strategic Partnerships

MaxiMine has formed multiple strategic partnerships with experienced firms and industry
professionals. Two such examples of the many key strategic partners are Bitmain and its associated
pool, Antpool. Bitmain is the leader of mining chips, and MaxiMine is the champion of mining farm
management and operation with many proprietary technologies and patents. By combining the best
of both worlds, MaxiMine has established a hyper efficient and highly profitably mining farm business
model.

By leveraging on deep ties to Bitmain and other strategic partners, MaxiMine will be able to gain
priority access to newly released products such as the Ethash ASIC, the Antminer E3 that were
acquired months before the mass market. Delivery of equipment and orders will also be expedited to
reduce capital lockup and allow for quicker establishment and setup for the farm.

3.4 Farm and Equipment

The first mining farm for MaxiMine is planned to house 40,000 Antminer S9i 14T mining rigs designed
for ASIC mining the SHA-256 algorithm used in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. Based on statistical analysis,
with a conservative estimate of a 50 cent CNY (7 cents USD) electrical cost, each mining rig has a
breakeven point of about 161 days. In this scenario, electrical costs accounted for slightly over 30% of
the total cost. Applying dynamic prediction to this model would generate an annualized ROI in CNY of
77% excluding machine depreciation and 45% including machine depreciation, with an annualized ROI
in BTC at 100% excluding depreciation and 98% including depreciation.

MaxiMine Whitepaper Draft v.1.1.1

3.5 Patents and Proprietary Technology
MaxiMine owns more than 20 patents related to mining rigs and mining operations, which provide a
significant competitive edge in the market.

For example, MaxiMine owns a full series of rig container-related patens: 201711275292.x;
201711274897.7; 201711274978.7; 201721678581.X; 201721678731.7; 201830165533.4; 201830165883.0;
201820590678.3; 201820589919.2; 201820589918.8; 201830173682.5, etc.

To use a patent as an example, BTC-BOX is an Invention Patent (201711275292.X) that allows the
construction of a modularized mining rig container.

BTC-BOX brings about major benefits in terms of better internal climate, temperature and humidity
control and real-time monitoring capabilities. Heat dissipation and cooling have also been optimized
through rigorous testing and innovation along with the durability of the containment unit throughout
the four different seasons. With proper cooling cycles and intelligent humidity control systems, mining
rigs can function at peak capacity all year round and increase the annualized return on investment per
rig.

The BTC-BOX is currently in its third generation (Invention Patent 20171127498.7) and has received
multiple improvements and upgrades since its initial conception. It is deployed live and used ona
daily basis in private mining farms owned by one of the founders.

MaxiMine Whitepaper Draft v.1.1.1

In the rare event that the farm has to be relocated due to regulatory requirements or natural disasters,
the modular design will be able to accelerate and expedite the relocation process, allowing the
relocation to be completed in a very short time. Post relocation, it will also enable rapid redeployment
of the mining rigs at the new farm, reducing downtime and increasing efficiency.

4. Mining Industry Analysis

4.1 Mining Equipment Investment Analysis

Our primary report and analysis are done based on corporate finance and investment analysis
methodology. We have made use of web crawler technology to collect data from a broad source, and
subsequently we present the data in a visualized style.

4.1.1 Purpose of Analysis

We will use Bitcoin mining as the example in our analysis. Based on the same point, we will analyse
the profitability of different mining rigs. We will also analyse and compare the profitability of the same
mining rig at different time points.

4.1.2 Influencing Factors for Mining Profit Projections

Human nature is complicated. As such, an ecosystem that is established on human nature will be a
subjected to influence from multiple factors and mechanisms. The figure below indicates the main
factors that affect the profitability of mining from the prospect of investment analysis. In reality, the
factors that affects bitcoin mining are more complicated.

We have taken into consideration multiple factors, including but not exclusive to mining difficulty,
bitcoin price, theoretical mining revenue, electricity cost, additional taxes and fees, cost of mining rigs
and hash power. A multitude of secondary factors such as changes in exchange rate would also impact
the projections to some degree. It should be mentioned that these factors fall into different categories
and cannot be represented clearly under the same scale in a single figure. We have therefore made
adjustment by upscaling or downscaling certain figures. The adjustment will not affect their historical
trend.

4.1.3 Computation Methodology for Investment Analysis

Project investment analysis generally makes use of NPV and ROI. In NPV analysis, only projects with
positive NPVs are accepted. Under ROI analysis, the ROI of a project should be higher than the
opportunity cost of the investment. In the following sections, we will use ROI to analyse the MaxiMine
project. When there is sufficient company data, NPV can also be used. The last section of this chapter
will briefly explain the formula used in the calculations.

Mining Difficulty and Corresponding Hash Power

Formula for mining difficulty dictated by encryption algorithm

DOT
p= (1.1)
DOT represents the number of HASH when the difficulty us at 1. It is a very big constant. It is usually
labelled as Ox1dOOffff and is a compression marker. CH is the current target HASH. It has been
compressed and then stored in the block. Only CH needs to be adjusted when the difficulty changes.
The smaller CH is, the greater the difficulty, and vice versa.

Through derivation of the above equation, we can obtain a new equation (1.2). We can there fore calculate the
HASH required (number of HASH) for block generation when the current difficulty is equal to D.

— Dx(23?)
~ 600

CH

(1.2)

Theoretical Return on Investment for Bitcoin Mining

The difficulty of mining (the number of HASH required for generation of a block) determines the demand
for computational power, which is directly correlated to the performance of the mining rigs. Therefore,
the theoretical return of any bitcoin mining device can be calculated by the following formula (1.3, 1.4,
1.5, 1.6, and 1.7)

CH
HT = (1.3)
PHT = (1.4)
EPHT = P27 (1.5)
XT
DEPHT = = (1.6)
1
ppT = + (1.7)
DEPHT+XT

Where M is equal to 10”, the unit multiplier of hashing power (1 KH/s*M=1 TH/s), HT is the hashing
power, V is the current number of bitcoins, and PHT is indicative of the computing power (unit is TH/s)
for acquiring a bitcoin. XT equals to the hashing power of a mining rig (unit is TH/s). EPHT refers to the
number of mining rigs needed to calculate the power of XT for one bitcoin. N equals to the number of
blocks created in one day. DEPHT represents the number of mining rigs needed to acquire a bitcoin in
one day, and PPT is the share of a bitcoin that a mining rig whose computing power is XT and one of
the power unit T can acquire ina day.

Page | 12
MaxiMine Whitepaper Draft v.1.1.1
Based on the above information, we can derive the theoretical gain in Bitcoin obtained per day and
express it as the following

M+V*N
CH

PPT =

(1.8)

Actual Mining Profit Calculation
= Gross Profit calculation

Using the above formula, we can calculate the theoretical gain per unit of has power per day based
on the performance of the mining rig. Using the following formula (1.9), we can calculate the actual
daily profit of the mining rig

GP = Price piteoin * XT * PPT (1.9)
Among them, Pricégitcoin refers to the actual price of bitcoin on that day; GP is the gross profit of the
mining machine for one day.

= Net Profit Calculation

The net profit equals to the gross profit minus the fixed cost (such as depreciation) and the variable
cost (such as electricity charges). The following formula can be used to calculate the daily net profit
per mining rig

W+24+Price_electric
1000

NP = GP — -@Q (1.10)

Where W refers to the power consumption of the mining machine (unit w) and Q refers to the fixed
cost.

= Payback Period Calculation

Based on the daily net profit calculated in the previous step, we can then calculate the return period
(in days) of the mining rig with the formula

__ Price_equipment
NP

PP (1.11)

= Investment Analysis for MaxiMine Mining Farm

With the formulae defined above, an in-depth analysis of the different mining rigs in the market can
be conducted.

Other Project Investment Analysis Indicators

= NPV

Page | 13
MaxiMine Whitepaper Draft v.1.1.1

The equation (1.12) reflects the dynamic profitability of the project within the time frame of construction
and production. It is the gross summation of NPV of the annual cash flow (according to certain discount rate)

during the construction and production period.

—yn _NCFe
NPV = ho

(1.12)

In this formula, Net Cash Flow (NCF), Discount Rate (r) and project cycle (n) are factors affecting NPV.
= IRR
Formula (1.13) represents the discount rate when the NPV of the project equals to zero or the discount rate
when the NPV of cash inflow equals to the NPV of cash outflow.

NPV = Yi.) NCF,(1 + IRR)~t = 0 (1.13)
In this equation, IRR is used to evaluate the profitability of the project. It is calculated based on the cash
flow of the project. IRR is not related to capital but associated with project decision making. The cost of
capital is the lowest IRR demanded by the investor when investing in the project. When making a decision,
the project is deemed feasible when IRR equals to or is greater than the cost of capital. Otherwise, the
project is not feasible.
= Profitability Index
Pl (profitability index) is also called current value index. Formula (1.14) represents the ratio between the

NPV of the future cash inflow (CIF) and the NPV of the future cash outflow (COF).

PI = Lo CIF((1+r)*
Do COR (1 +11)

(1.14)
When PI>1, the project is feasible. Otherwise, it is not feasible.

= Pay Back Period

PP (payback period) is the time taken for net cash flow to get back the investment. When the annual net

cash flows are different, we use the following formula (1.15).

ILNCFy-1l

CNCFy (1.15)

PP = Naccumulative-net-cash-flo — 1+

Naccumulative-net-cash-flow represents the number of years taken before the accumulated net cash flow turns to
positive. LNCF-1 represents the absolute value of the accumulated cash flow the year before. CNCFN
represents the cash flow in the current year. In the calculation of PP, the time span is in days and the

assumption is that the daily net cash flow is equal

4.2 MaxiMine Investment Study

4.2.1 Mining Rig Performance Within the Same Timeframe

This section selects various types of mining pools or miners and compares and analyse relevant data
of 20 different mainstream bitcoin mining equipment, focusing on the same time period (July 2018),
to compare and analyse three indicators related to the earnings of mining rigs. The evaluation
indicators include the daily net profit of a single mining rig, the daily net income per time period of a
single mining rig, and the daily return period of a single mining rig (under fixed net income).

The histogram below shows the comparison results of specific daily net income and daily net income
per time period calculation for 20 different types of mining rigs.

“ult alla

“lull |

Based on the above information, the payback period can be calculated for the different mining rigs. It
should be noted that when the net income is negative, this report will set the payback period to the
negative mining price. This setting is only for the simple labelling of models of mining rigs with poor
investment returns.

The larger the first two indicators, the greater the expectation of future investment returns. The larger
the third indicator, the higher the future investment risk. This analysis is based on one time point
(when there is sufficient data, we can choose more historical points to compare and not just the
current point). To ensure the reliability and consistency of the analysis result, we will pick only the top
5 mining rigs for comparison in the next analysis.

4.2.2 Investment Analysis of the Same Mining Rig at Different Time Points

Using the above selected mining rigs, we extend the time points under analysis and calculate three
indicators using dynamic data. It should be noted that there is a lack of long-term data on mining rigs
such as the most optimized mining rig every month in six years and their hashing power, price and
power consumption. As such, it is not possible to do a more wholistic calculation. The following
analysis is based on the assumption that the parameters related to the mining rigs are not changed in
the recent two months.

Since the price of electricity, the difficulty of mining and the price of mining machines have become
fixed variables in a short span of time, changes at different points are mainly caused by the price of
Bitcoin. In addition, these calculations do not consider depreciation expenses and the cost of taxes for
simplicity.

5. MXM Token

5.1 Minekonony

MaxiMine is the first to propose Minekonomy whereby Solidity-based MaxiMine (MXM) is used as the
value equivalent and media in the mining economy. Compared with traditional cloud mining,
MaxiMine does not sell or rent hashing power, but create liquidity in hash power and equipment
through the use of tokens.

By depositing MXM into a fixed duration smart contract, an amount of hashing power will be provided
to the user for the specific coin throughout the deposit period. The calculations for the allocated
hashing power will be based on multiple factors including:

e Price of each mining rig

e Hashing power of each rig

e Weighted average price of MXM over the last three days
e Deposit period

e Network difficulty

e Capacity and efficiency of the entire farm

It can also be expressed as a simple function as below

The mining reward per day = f (Pricey, Amountyxm, Price;igs, Durationockup, Networkaigs)

5.2 System Design

We will implement the computation and distribution of the profit on the Ethereum network to ensure
fairness and transparency of the whole process. In the future, MaxiMine will also launch our own
protocol.

5.2.1 Staking Contracts

The different staking options will be split into multiple contracts on the blockchain and will function
independent to each other. Bonus tier structures and applicable fees will also be hardcoded into the
contract to emphasis on transparency and fairness. Each contract will receive inputs directly from the
investor’s wallet, with communication protocols set up and executed through the mobile application.
They will also read supplementary off-chain information directly from the oracle contract to assist in
their calculations. The staking contracts will be able to process network information and calculate the
mining rewards per investor autonomously. They will individually track each and every investor wallet
and send out the mining rewards and deposit at the end of the stake duration. As the mining rewards
may not be Ether, MXM will mint new ERC20 tokens for each mineable cryptocurrency with a “M”
header such as “MBTC”. These tokens will not have any value or utility and will instead function as a
temporary placeholder for the actual cryptocurrency. Therefore, the tokens released by the smart
contract will be ERC20 equivalents of the actual mining reward to track the value of each wallet and
investor. Each contract will hold the total supply of the placeholders to ensure there is enough for
distribution. They will be periodically topped-up by MaxiMine at the end of each staking period post
distribution.

MaxiMine Whitepaper Draft v.1.1.1

5.2.2 “Oracle” Contract

Due to the nature of the MaxiMine project and the multi-chain mining capabilities, a number of inputs
and parameters can only be accessed off-chain (such as the Bitcoin network difficulty). To facilitate
this requirement, MaxiMine will create an Ethereum Oracle and set up multiple trusted data feeds to
send information over to it. The Oracle smart contract will then store the information collected off-
chain onto the Ethereum network itself, allowing other smart contracts to read the data from it
directly.

In the initial considerations for the Oracle setup, each depositing contract would function as an Oracle
with off-chain data being fed directly to each of them. However, the long-term transactional cost and
data efficiency would be lower as compared with setting up one primary oracle for the other contracts
to collect data from.

The data feeds will be done through multiple wallet addresses to ensure reliability and redundancy of
information. This process will be done automatically through API calls with a publicly available
codebase to encourage transparency and reduce manual intervention. Most of the data will be
collected directly from the Bitcoin blockchain to execute the computations and calculations for
network difficulty and mining rewards, while cross referencing the realized mining rewards directly
from the miner address utilized.

5.2.3 Mining Reward Distribution

m MXM Staker mReinvestment Operational Expenses

The mining rewards earned for each mining rig per hash owned by MXM investors will be distributed
into the following ratios:

e 80% of mining rewards will be given to the investors who deposited MXM
e 16% of mining rewards will be reinvested into the mining farm
e 4% of mining rewards will be used to cover operational expenses

The bulk of the mining rewards will be distributed to the investors as investment returns. A small
portion of the remainder will be used to cover the operational expenses incurred in daily maintenance
and servicing of the mining rigs as well as the staff required on site to provide 24h monitoring and
diagnostics. The balance will be reinvested into the mining farm and used to purchase more mining
rigs for expansion. The additional reinvestment will also be used to increase the returns of MXM in
the long run as there will be more hashing power allocated per token.

The primary interface for MXM holders to stake their tokens for hashing power would be a mobile
application available on both iOS and Android.

A mobile application was chosen as it would allow for a simple control interface accessible by most
of our investors in any place. In addition to that, the risk of users being phished is lower as the
application is installed on the phone and less prone to web attack vectors.

Within the app, users will be able carry out MXM related functions:

e View account balance and active contracts

e Manage account and profile

e Compare various contract rates and returns

e Stake MXM to additional contracts

e Synchronize and verify wallet addresses across all mineable cryptocurrencies
e View daily returns and forecasts

e Withdraw mining rewards

In the long run, the application would also be able to function as a part of a larger MXM ecosystem
and transition into a multi-purpose app, capable of handling payments, investment and many other
features.

6. MaxiMine Ecosystem

6.1 MaxiMine Decentralized Operating System (MDOS)

After the initial launch phase of MaxiMine and the establishment of the mining farm, excess resources
will be used to develop a protocol to fuel the MXM ecosystem. The envisioned protocol will be able
to solve the primary challenges faced by most public blockchains in the industry and will serve as the
underlying backbone for the decentralized applications and tokens launched within this ecosystem.

6.2 MaxiMine Protocol

The MaxiMine protocol is designed to be a decentralized operating system powered by the entire
network and secured by the combined hashing power of all cryptocurrency mining farms. It consists
of a three-tier architecture comprising of a transactional layer, functional layer and application layer.

Transactional Layer

The transactional layer is designed as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with transactions propagating
between various wallet addresses without using blocks to store transactional data. Instead, each
wallet will function as a pseudo-blockchain and record transaction inputs and outputs. Database
sharding and segregated witness technologies will reduce the network load per wallet address and
enable each node to store minimal data while ensuring the overall integrity of the entire network.
Network sharding and off-chain technologies will be applied to accelerate transactional throughput
and network functionalities. Conservative estimates for the transactional layer have surfaced a million
transactions per second as the effective network load, scaling linearly together with an increase in
nodes and transactions.

Functional Layer

Smart contracts would be deployed on the functional layer of the protocol and run on a POW
consensus algorithm within a blockchain optimized for smart contract calculations. This would
essentially function as a sidechain to the transactional layer while allowing for seamless data transfer
and interactions with the transactional layer. One such example would be the minting of tokens using
the MXM-001 standard on MDOS. The contract would be deployed from a wallet in the transactional

Page | 22
MaxiMine Whitepaper Draft v.1.1.1

layer and then hosted within the functional layer blockchain for future references. Function calls
would also be executed onto the smart contract directly from the wallets.

Application Layer

The application layer will be an interface to collect, read and access data across multiple smart
contracts for decentralized applications to interact with the other two layers.

In addition to that, side-chain verification techniques using cryptographic signatures will allow
transactions to be executed offline, using either the camera for QR code recognition or the speaker
and microphone of smartphones for high frequency audio QR data exchange.

Transactional Layer

6.3 MaxiMine Ecosystem

As a value equivalent backed by real and tangible asset, MXM can be used to establish an entire
ecosystem. The project team and advisory board include leading industrial player, high-tech
professional and product expert. The prerequisites for building a super ecosystem are all in place, and
preparation work has already been done.

6.3.1 Cross-border transaction system

MXM being the medium of exchange will be able to carry out direct wallet transaction from a business
and consumer point of perspective. In addition, the ecosystem support USD, Euros, RMB and digital
currency. Users can choose to pay or exchange using digital fiat currency, cryptocurrency or any digital
asset within the MaxiMine ecosystem.

We will construct a new cross-border transactional structure, using distributed network system to
replace centralised organisations. This will reduce intermediary cost as well as eliminate lengthy and
complex transaction process.

6.3.2 On-chain Data sharing

We will have dApps build on the MaxiMine ecosystem to provide credit services for individual users
and SMEs. Subsequently, this can establish a big data sharing economy for every user on the platform.
Currently the credit industry core issue lies with data. Such problems include data isolation, lack of
shared data economy and data ownership protection, as well as high data acquisition cost. MaxiMine
on-chain credit utilise blockchain technology to establish a decentralised, open and immutable credit
data platform for businesses and merchants.

The source of MaxiMine credit data originates from early data owners who go through an approved
panel of credit service agencies as a mean of data review before broadcasting on-chain. The
authentication of the data is guaranteed and endorsed by the data reviewers. On-chain credit can be
classified into a few categories: credit data enquirers, credit data contributors, credit data owners.
The originate of data sources include transaction data, contract data, asset data, creditor data which
will be encrypted and stored on the blockchain.

6.3.3 Shared economy

MaxiMine will be pushing out shared smart contract on the blockchain. People can use their houses,
cars or shared objects to sign a smart leasing contract on the blockchain, eliminating the need of
paying commission to intermediaries. Related outcomes coming from the smart contract such as fees,
losses, disputes will be stored on the blockchain. This will be integrated with the blockchain credit
system to establish an efficient, fair and transparent shared economic platform.

6.3.4 P2P loan

The loan smart contract and the related data outcome will be stored in a distributed ledger, increasing
the cost of a default or to cause potential attack. In the MaxiMine lending platform, users can use
cryptocurrency, digital fiat currency to initiate loan globally and not restricted to specific country or
region. Due to the characteristic of distributed ledger, it reinforces the safety, transparency and
immutability of the lending platform, increasing the efficiency of P2P loan.

6.3.5 Initial Coin Offering (ICO)

Community member can engage MaxiMine platform for crowdfunding. MaxiMine Foundation will
provide quality projects with funds and technical support. In comparison with traditional investment
and financing, MaxiMine crowdfunding platform will help projects with their initial phase
development as well as creating much ideal community.

Page | 24
MaxiMine Whitepaper Draft v.1.1.1

6.3.6 Intellectual platform

The blockchain technical aspect and intellectual platform will provide the original content with
confirmation and traceability. Users who publish original content on the MaxiMine intellectual
platform will be stored on the blockchain. Movie, gaming and other intellectual companies can access
the platform to search for original quality content and purchase the content copyright. Decentralised
intellectual platform and intellectual marketplace have greatly reduced the intermediary cost and
eliminate the monopolisation of quality content. This provide original content creators, consumers,
movie firms, gaming companies and other vendors in the intellectual marketplace a transparent
network environment.

6.3.7 Blockchain Games

The main attribute for open source games is that gamers’ assets are protected. It is immutable and
cannot be encroached. This give gaming equipment the circulating value, eliminating the potential
possibility of cheating from game developers. In the MaxiMine ecosystem, developers can develop
community type and autonomous type of blockchain games. This in combination with the existing
MaxiMine community will be a breakthrough in the traditional gaming market for developers and
users, providing transparency, interaction and exchange of value within the blockchain gaming
community.

8. Roadmap

Project Launch - 20 July 2017

In July 2017, the MaxiMine team researched the feasibility and profitability of cryptocurrency mining
via an ambitious token offering. The team studied existing mining pools, such as antpool and cloud
mining facilities. The study concludes: Developing a mining pool with distributed revenue system to
manage large-scale cloud mining is an ideal programme.

MXM Pre-sale & Public Offering — Apr-Jun 2018

MaxiMine team will conduct pre-sale for high net worth investors to buy tokens in bulk. Most of the
money obtained from the pre-sale will enable the team to pay a deposit for the required mining
equipment. The public offering will allow investors around the world to be part of the MaxiMine
community.

Equipment Purchase — May 2018

MaxiMine team will contact hardware vendors to bulk purchase mining equipment, this phase of the
funds will be used to pay equipment down payment and surveying feasible locations for the
construction of mining facilities.

Construction of Mining Facilities - Sep 2018

MaxiMine has secured an area for its mining pool in Northern China. The team will oversee the
building of the mining facilities. Recruitment will also be conducted for experienced individuals in
related sectors such as datacentres and strict background checks will be conducted for all individuals.

First Mining Reward Payout — Dec 2018

MaxiMine will pay investors who have pledged MXM at the start with the earnings from the mining
operations. These payments will be distributed on a monthly basis from this point onwards and sent
to the individual wallets of each investor. Investor confidence will also increase once tangible returns
have been deposited into their holdings.

Expansion of Mining Facilities — Early 2019

MaxiMine will use operating profits to expand the mining pool. This will provide accretive value to the
mining pool and MXM tokens while increasing the return-on-investment for all existing and early stage
investors. The increased ROI would also positively impact the perception of the token.

11.1 Legal Risks

According to the “Development of China's Blockchain Technology and Applications
Whitepaper” published on 18 October 2016 by the Ministry of Industry and Information
Technology of the People’s Republic of China, blockchains are used as an integrated
application for distributed data storage, point-to-point transmission, blockchain confirmation
mechanism, encryption mechanism and other technologies. In recent years, it has become a hot
topic of research and discussion by international organisations like the United Nations (UN),
the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and many countries. The industry has also increased
investments. Currently, the application of blockchain has been extended to many Internet of
Things (IoT), Supply Chain Management, Digital Asset Trading. It will also bring new
opportunities for the development of next-generation information technologies such as Cloud
Computing, Big Data, and Mobile Internet. It has the ability to trigger a new round of
technological innovation and industrial change.

The blockchain is currently starting its transition to individual application development. Some
typical applications have been presented, and the financial and commodity industries also show
broad application prospects. The scope of the applications can be roughly divided into three
parts of transaction — before, during, and after transaction. Pre-transaction includes the
understanding of customers, anti-money laundering, information disclosure, etc; transaction
itself includes stocks, bonds, debt collection tools, and issuance and transfer of derivatives;
post-transaction includes registration, custody, liquidation, settlement, data sharing, splitting
of shares, voting of shareholders, dividend payment, collateral management, and crowdfunding
management. At present, there are differences in the attitude and regulation of blockchain
technology among countries.

On 5 December 2013, the People’s Bank of China, Ministry of Industry and Information
Technology, China Banking Regulatory Commission, China Securities Regulatory
Commission, and the China Insurance Regulatory Commission jointly issued “Notice on
Prevention of Bitcoin Risks” (Yinfa [2013] No. 289). The main content of the “Notice” is on
clear Bitcoin attributes. It is believed that Bitcoin does not have any monetary attributes such
as legality and mandatory compensatory currency attributes, and

that it is not a real currency. In terms of the nature, Bitcoin is a specific virtual commodity that
does not have the same legal status as currency and should not be used as a currency for
circulation in the market. Financial institutions and payment agencies are also prohibited from
developing Bitcoin related businesses. Financial institutions and payment agencies are not
allowed to price their products or services with Bitcoin currency. They are also not to buy or
sell Bitcoin, or be a central counterparty that buys or sells Bitcoin. They also are not to
underwrite insurance services related to Bitcoin, or to include Bitcoin in insurance coverage,
or to serve customers with Bitcoin e.g. providing Bitcoin registration, transaction, clearing,
settlement and other services to customers. They are not to accept or use Bitcoin as a payment
settlement tool. Other restrictions include, Bitcoin-RMB-foreign currency exchange services,
Bitcoin storage, custody, mortgage and other businesses, the distribution of Bitcoin-related
financial products, Bitcoin as a trust, funds and other investment targets. With that, there is a
request to enhance the management of Bitcoin internet sites. Internet sites that provide services
such as Bitcoin registration and trading services must be filed with the telecommunications

MaxiMine Whitepaper Draft v.1.1.1

regulatory agencies in accordance with the relevant provisions of the “Telecommunications
Regulations of the People’s Republic of China” and the “Administrative Measures for Internet
Information Services”. There is also the requirement to strengthen the prevention of bitcoin
money laundering risks. Firstly, all branches of the People’s Bank of China are required to pay
close attention to the trends of Bitcoin and other similar virtual goods which have the features
of anonymity and cross-border circulation convenience. They have to consider the risk of
money laundering, and study to formulate preventive measures. Each branch should
incorporate into the anti-money laundering regulation the institutions that are legally
established in the jurisdiction, provide services such as bitcoin registration and transactions,
and urge them to strengthen anti-money laundering monitoring. Second, Internet sites that
require the provision of services such as bitcoin registration and transaction services should
effectively fulfil their anti-money laundering obligations by identifying user identities through
requiring users to use their real names, ID numbers and other information when registering.
Thirdly, all financial institutions, payment institutions, and internet stations that provide
services such as Bitcoin registration and transaction services should immediately report to the
China Anti-Money Laundering Monitoring and Analysis Center and cooperate with the
People’s Bank of China if any suspicious transactions related to Bitcoin and other virtual goods
are found. For the discovery of the use of bitcoin for fraud, gambling, money-laundering and
other criminal activity clues, it should promptly report the case to the public safety agencies.
In March 2014, the People's Bank of China once again issued the “Notice on Further
Strengthening Bitcoin Risk Prevention Work”, requesting all banks and third-party payment
agencies to close all trading accounts of all bitcoin platforms in China by 15 April. This means
that it is illegal for financial institutions to open accounts for the trading accounts of the Bitcoin
website platforms. However, the “Notice” mentioned above does not prohibit Bitcoin
transactions. As a result, Bitcoin transactions are still active in the market as a commodity
trading activity on the Internet, and are also sought after by some capitals. It is required to
educate and strengthen the investment risk awareness of the public’s currency knowledge. The
"Notice" requires the correct understanding of currency, proper viewing of virtual goods and
virtual currency, rational investment, reasonable control of investment risks, and maintenance
of own property safety be incorporated into the contents of financial knowledge dissemination
activities, in order to guide the public to establish a correct currency and investment mindsets.

The US federal government's main focus on blockchain technology is focused on virtual
currency regulation of blockchain technology. Some government agencies have specifically
issued guidance documents on blockchain technology and ICO. In 2013, the US Department
of the Treasury's law enforcement agency, FinCEN, included the “exchangeable virtual
currency” was included in the “money service business” in the Banking Secrecy Act (BSA).
Hence, according to this, in the United States, the virtual currency transaction needs to be
registered with the Ministry of Finance and is also involved in the anti-money laundering
project. However, the Act and the "Application of Financial

Crimes Law Enforcement Network Regulations in Personal Management, Exchange, and Use
of Virtual Currencies", issued by the law enforcement agency, all consider virtual currency "a
valuable though unlawful currency" which does not have all the attributes of the actual currency
and legal currency status. The Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) of the US Commodity Futures
Trading Commission (CFTC) can be applied to virtual currencies since the definition of
"goods" is very broad; the definition can include "bonds, stocks, and currencies, etc”. In March
2014, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Taxation issued a circular stating that bitcoin and other virtual
currencies are assets, similar to other valuable goods, not currencies, and that bitcoin mining,
trading, and use should be applied Tax rules, tax returns. In 3 June 2015, New York State, after

MaxiMine Whitepaper Draft v.1.1.1

approximately one year, from the initial motion of Bitcoin Licensing, to the resumption of the
motion, and finally to the legal provisions, the New York State Department of Financial
Services released the final The "Bitcoin Licensing Regulation" with the aim to regulate "Virtual
currency business". According to the "Bitcoin Licensing Regulations," "virtual currency" is
defined to include decentralized currency based on blockchain technology, where "virtual
currency business activities" include: (1) the transmission of virtual currency, (2) the use of
virtual money for others, (3) the purchase or sale of virtual currency as a customer business,
(4) the provision of transaction services as a customer business, and (5) control, management
or issuance of virtual currency. The main contents of the “Bitcoin Licensing Regulations”
include: first, safeguarding the assets of consumers; second, after completing any transaction,
the trading platform should provide detailed information to customers; third, establish a
consumer complaints policy; fourth, have a disclosure of risks for customers; fifth is the
establishment of an anti-money laundering mechanism; sixth is the establishment of a cyber
security plan; seventh is the establishment of a chief information security officer; eighth is the
maintenance of books and records; nineth is a report and financial disclosure; tenth is a funding
requirement; eleventh is a Compliance Executive Officer; twelfth is that each licensee should
establish business continuity and disaster recovery plans, and so on. It is widely believed that
the New York State’s legal rules for the introduction of virtual currency are at least a
meaningful exploration and attempt. There will be two short-term results: first, it will increase
the spending of participants in the market because of their mandatory procedures — password
security, consumer protection, financial reporting and anti-money laundering. Indeed, many
companies have opted out of New York because the full cost of complying with the rules and
enforcement will be between $50,000 and $100,000. Second, the certainty of the license makes
the company's legal risk in this area lower, so it is very likely that there will be a smoother path
for the integration of blockchain business with the already established banking system. In the
United States judicial trials, there have been cases concerning blockchain technology, mainly
involving money laundering in criminal cases, where the technology used by the defendant for
money laundering is blockchain technology. For example, in November 2014, a number of
websites in New York State of the United States involved the use of blockchain technology
and virtual currency for money laundering transactions. These websites were eventually
sentenced to confiscation of property; in April 2015, in the case of US v. Ross Ulbricht, the
defendant was involved in a number of charges such as narcotics trading, computer hacking,
and money laundering where the technology used by the defendant was blockchain technology.

The EU implemented legal restrictions on blockchain on 5 July 2016 where the European
Commission passed a bill to amend the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Act (4AMLD). The
Act explicitly includes the transactions of virtual currencies in the anti-money laundering
framework. In August 2013, Germany recognized the legal status of Bitcoin and incorporated
it into the national regulatory system, thus becoming the first country in the world to recognize
the legal status of Bitcoin. The German government stated that Bitcoin can be used as a private
currency and currency unit. Bitcoin is tax-exempt for personal use within one year, but it is
taxed for commercial purposes. The German Financial Supervisory Authority believes that
Bitcoin is a value token used to exchange real economic goods or services that are circulated
in barter clubs, private bazaars or other payment systems. At present,

Germany's policy on Bitcoin is relatively clear. Bitcoin.de, the German Bitcoin trading
platform, has also cooperated with Fidor Bank.

In August 2014, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) issued bitcoin taxation guidelines and
formally incorporated Bitcoin and related business practices into the existing tax system. The

Page | 38
MaxiMine Whitepaper Draft v.1.1.1

Australian Taxation Bureau (ATO) does not regard Bitcoin as a currency nor does it clarify the
positioning of its financial assets. It treats it as ordinary assets. The main content is as follows:
personal use of Bitcoin transactions should not involve any goods tax and income tax; when an
enterprise uses Bitcoin to purchase goods or services, the value of the goods purchased must
be converted into Australian dollars and recorded as revenue of the company; capital gains,
that is, as an asset, involve capital gains tax when the company cleans up bitcoin; Bitcoin can
be used to pay wages, and such payments are similar to fringe benefits for businesses where
employers may pay a fringe benefit tax for this purpose; mining (production) Bitcoin, and the
revenue derived from mining (production) Bitcoin for commercial purposes, will be regarded
as taxable income.

With regard to Thailand’s legal regulation on blockchain, senior officials of Thailand’s foreign
exchange administration and policy department have stated that the following bitcoin activities
are considered illegal in Thailand due to the lack of applicable legal and capital controls and
that Bitcoin crosses a variety of financial businesses, such as, Bitcoin trading, buying and
selling any goods or services using Bitcoin, or have Bitcoins exchanges with anyone outside
of Thailand.

In Singapore, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced on | August 2017 that
the token must be regulated by the Securities Act of Singapore (No. 289 of the National
Assembly Act). The Token Issuance Instruction issued by the MAS on 14 November 2017
states that ifa token has a capital market financial product as defined in the Singapore Securities
Act, they should be incorporated into the supervision of the Monetary Authority of Singapore.
They include securities, futures contracts, leveraged foreign exchange contracts or
arrangements. For example, a digital currency has the following properties: (1) shares,
including the rights conferred or represented on behalf of the owner of the company or business,
represent the owner's legal obligations; (2) bonds, constituting a token issuer or token holder
may lend (3) The Collective Investment Scheme (CIS), which represents the rights and
obligations of the investment group or the right to choose an investment plan, shall be subject
to the jurisdiction of the MAS.

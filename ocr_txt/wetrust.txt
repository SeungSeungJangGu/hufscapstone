Abstract

WetTrust is a collaborative savings, lending and insurance platform that is autonomous,
agnostic, frictionless, and decentralized. WeTrust utilizes the Ethereum blockchain to create a
full-stack alternative financial system that leverages existing social capital and trust networks,
eliminating the need for a “trusted third party”, allowing for lower fees, improved incentive
structures, decentralized risks, allowing a greater amount of capital to reside among the
participants, and ultimately improving financial inclusion on a global scale.

WetTrust’s first product is a Trusted Lending Circle (TLC) platform, inspired by the ~1 billion
people around the world who are using informal TLCs or Rotating and Saving Credit
Associations (ROSCAs) to lend/ borrow, and support each other financially within their
communities. On top of Trusted Lending Circles, WeTrust plans to build future products that
include sovereign credit identities, trusted direct lending, mutual insurance, and more.

Vision

WetTrust’s vision is to leverage social capital, trust networks, and blockchain technology to
create a financial system that has aligned interests with all of it’s participants. 2 billion adults! in
this world do not have a bank account and the existing financial system has many
contradictions. One cannot get an affordable loan without having well-paying job and good

Measuring Financial Inclusion around the World” (2015).
credit, while legitimate insurance claims directly reduce an insurance firm’s profits. The
un-banked and un-insured are most hurt from this lack of access and misalignment of interests,
and are always in search of alternative financial solutions.

We believe that today’s banks and insurance companies play an important role in society.
However, in contrast to other industries where undifferentiated products result in low margins,
they thrive because of their important role as a “trusted third party”. Yet, our research shows that
there is an alternative to this dependency on a “trusted third party’, one which can help reduce
the friction necessitated by centralized intermediaries and result in a more inclusive financial
system where everyone has access to fair, market-priced credit and insurance.

A fundamental building block we plan to use in creating an alternative already exists via a
tradition used globally by over 1 billion people -- Trusted Lending Circles (aka Rotating and
Saving Credit Association or ROSCA). This grassroots organization leverages personal
reputation and social ties -- and draws upon 2,000 years[1] of resilience and effectiveness in
offering credit and insurance to communities around the world.

Our first product is a Trusted Lending Circle platform powered by the blockchain - one which
enables the creation of social safety nets that address economic uncertainty and provides
opportunity for growth. It is the first of a series of products that include credit identities and
scores, lending, mutual insurance, and much more -- all of which leverage the untapped social
capital and trust networks that already exist.

In this whitepaper, we propose a plan to implement our vision to amplify the strengths of social
capital and reputation based networks, while addressing their weaknesses: scalability, fraud,
and lack of innovation.

Naturally, our products and research are always a work in progress. We welcome comments,
questions and ideas for improvement from our community. Please contact us here with you
thoughts.

Market Review

Social safety nets have functioned among humans for millennia since prehistoric times, starting
from hunter gatherer societies[2]. In modern times, there are three primary forms of social safety
nets: Government, Commercial, and Reciprocal.

Government aid can come in the form of Social Security, Unemployment, Medicare, etc...
Unavailable for most global citizens, government aid is also underfunded where currently
offered (US, countries in the EU, Japan, etc...), according to leading economists’. While most
people in developing countries already experience the lacking nature of Government Aid, many
in the developed countries are starting to realize that as well.

Commercial aid comes in the form of purchased insurance or emergency loans, and is often
laden with high operating costs, especially for those who need it the most. More importantly,
commercial aid has a shareholder-first mentality, often to the detriment of policyholders/
borrowers, and has a precedent of taking risks that endanger the financial system (see AIG
bailouts in 2008[3]). Lastly, this form of safety net is simply inaccessible to two billion adults and
their dependents, ~40% of the global population.

The third option is Reciprocal Aid. Simply put, it is any organization where voluntary participants
play the role of both aid giver and receiver depending on the circumstance. They exist in many
forms around the world including Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (referred to as
Trusted Lending Circle from here on in this document, also known by different local names
globally), mutual insurance groups, fraternal organizations, religious groups, and professional
societies. In these organizations, participants receive, by average, what they contribute over the
life of their membership, and self-reliance is a core attribute. Their decline in recent years is due
to inability to scale efficiently, lack of transparency relative to Commercial aid, and the increased
role of Governmental Aid.

While these organizations play an important role in their respective communities and are
currently used by billions of people globally across developing and developed economies,
Reciprocal Aid is not a panacea. Instead, WeTrust views reciprocal aid as a critical leg to the
three legged stool of protection against uncertainty, and serves a complementary role along with
Government and Commercial aid. Furthermore, WeTrust believes that the Social Capital and
Trust Networks found in traditional Reciprocal Aid organizations can be leveraged and blended
with characteristics found in Commercial organizations, to create entities that result in: lower
default rates, better rates for both savers and borrowers, lower expense ratios and lower
fraudulent claims for insurance.

Lastly, while many countries that rely upon Reciprocal Aid have low rates of financial inclusion,
some institutions have attempted to address the lack of financial inclusion by facilitating access
to outside capital via peer-to-peer lending (P2P)[4], such as those offered by Kiva.org. Kiva.org
is a well known non-profit that has brought P2P loans to developing countries, but it’s
penetration and usage has been limited and is in some cases controversial[5] due to high fees,
multiple transaction steps, and lack of transparency. WeTrust believes there is a way to improve
financial inclusion via a reciprocal aid approach that is transparent, requires low fees, and
promotes sustainable growth.

Trusted Lending Circle, a simple reciprocal aid organization:

Savings and lending is a foundational building block of modern society, serving as both funds in
times of financial need and fuel for funding economic growth. Access to capital can have impact
of historical proportions. Without access to capital, Columbus’s expeditions to the Americas may
not have occurred, and perhaps nor would the subsequent explorations of the “New World”.
Without proper financing mechanisms, neither the Industrial Revolution nor the tech boom in
Silicon Valley would have spread at such rapid speed. Both national and local economies are
affected by the ease or difficulty to access capital.

For thousands of years, people around the world have created mechanisms within the
communities to save money, lend and borrow from each other and create financial safety nets.

One of the most widespread communal financial institutions in the developing world are Trusted
Lending Circles.

A Trusted Lending Circle is “a group of individuals who agree to meet for a defined period in
order to save and borrow together, a form of combined peer-to-peer banking and peer-to-peer
lending.”[6] Trusted Lending Circles are commonly built along clan, geographical, social, or
professional networks. In countries around the world, these organizations have a variety of
different names such as: susus (Ghana/ Caribbean Islands), tandas (Latin America), hui
(China), chit funds (India), cundinas (Mexico), etc...[7]

Figure1.2: Trusted Lending Circle mechanics in a full Epoch

In a Trusted Lending Circle, individuals contribute a fixed amount for a set duration at regular
intervals, and the money is distributed each interval to individuals via a lottery, a bidding
process, or other method as decided by participants (the example above shows bidding,
whereas a lottery is a random selection). Some researchers® claim that these groups produce
results where all participants are individually better off[8] (or no more worse off) than not
participating in the group (pareto efficient[9]).

Each Trusted Lending Circle has a foreperson, who is organizing the Circle and is responsible
to collect funds from all participants. Trusted lending Circles are created among people with
close and trusting relationships and social capital is the driving force for continuous
participation.

Economics and Finance 1, 229-238 (2012).
Trusted Lending Circles have their own set of pros and cons compared to modern banking

institutions:

Some advantages include:

Reduced interest rates that are spread between savers and borrowers.
Communal proprietorship — a financial institution that’s owned by its users.

Group saving has been shown to be more effective in achieving individual
savings goals due to accountability - akin to group exercise programs

Lack of bureaucracy, less fraud, lower default rates, and non-profit motive for the
platform

Community benefits from using Trusted Lending Circles:

Facilitates reciprocation of credit disbursal. The give-and-take interaction helps
increase social bonds, as borrowing and returning money is a significant sign of
trust.

Avoids exorbitant interest and fees that are funneled towards fragile centralized
institutions thousands of miles away, and keeps capital within the community,
encouraging growth in the local economy

Encourages community participation in other fields of development — the
participatory approach of informal initiatives is easily replicable to a wide range of
community development issues.

Disadvantages of Trusted Lending Circles

Informal groups are sub-scale and difficult to increase in size due to the need for
in-person interaction - resulting in less efficient lending supply/demand matching.
Informal groups have zero tracking or credit-building outside the immediate
organization, therefore no additional financial products can be built on top of
one’s successful credit history interacting with a siloed Lending Circle.

High setup and handling fees charged by state-run Lending Circles (e.g., 5% flat
fee plus additional interest to access credit is typical in India; Kerala State
Company employs thousands and has billions in operational costs[10])

WeTrust Product Ecosystem

WetTrust is developing a novel financial platform powered by social capital, trust networks,
blockchain technology, and includes Trusted Lending Circles, Trusted direct lending, mutual
insurance and community-based building of credit history.

WeTrust’s first product is the Trusted Lending Circle, a platform for Rotating Savings and
Credit Associations (ROSCA), which consists of a smart contract which automates the savings
and lending process. This encompasses contributions, bidding, assigning funds at the end of
each round, and withdrawing funds. We plan to package this within a mobile web application
which an individual can use to manage their participation in one or multiple Trusted Lending
Circles. The product has built-in network effects, and incentivizes users to invite trusted
associates, which helps seed the network. We believe group based borrowing and lending
provides greater social incentives for all participants[11], and a customizable framework allows
groups to operate according to their particular needs and circumstances.

A Trusted Lending Circle uses technology to amplify the strengths and address the
shortcomings of traditional ROSCAs by enabling scalability, automating record keeping, and
reducing the potential for fraud.

In parallel with developing Trusted Lending Circles, we will also integrate the use of
stablecoins. These tokens have the transactional qualities of cryptocurrencies and are critical for
widespread adoption as they are pegged one to one with fiat currencies and resistant to
day-to-day volatility. Our end goal is to have users be able to use our platform without having to
understand the underlying complexity.

WeTrust’s second product is distributed, sovereign credit identities. Credit identities will be
created based on several factors: adherence to Lending Circle terms and the quality of tethered
social media accounts. Responsible individuals will be able to build up a strong credit identity,
which will enable greater trustworthiness and eventually more powerful features such as the
ability to vouch for other members and potentially build trust with individuals formerly outside
their social circle. In addition, upon request, credit identities could be shared with external
entities (Such as traditional banks) to show proof of credit history. Identity is a critical component
that enables Lending Circles to scale and become larger savings groups, thus enabling
improved credit supply/demand matching and better interest rates for the marketplace.

WeTrust’s third product is a Trust Network Powered Lending and Borrowing platform that
connects borrowers and savers, and allows for direct loans with minimal fees.

This product is different from existing market solutions due to our ability to leverage the credit
identities created previously, the concept of trust inference (social graph), legal contracts and
deterrents, and loan guarantees where trusted members vouch and earn fees for taking on
reputation risk and partial responsibility for others’ loans. While this concept is in the early
stages of development, prior WeTrust products form the foundation that enables a more
insightful way to quantify risk and create proper checks/ balances that deter against potential
fraud, so that lending and borrowing can extend beyond one’s immediate social circle in a safe
and efficient manner.

WeTrust’s fourth product is a Mutual Insurance platform which involves smart contracts that
evaluate whether or not a set of non-subjective criteria was met (i.e. a drought, or low rainfall)
and pay out accordingly. As all criteria for payouts would be public and governed by smart
contracts, the process will require minimal fees. However, there are many forms of insurance
that do require detailed auditing and reviews. For these, WeTrust plans to create a mechanism
that enables a decentralized process flow which incentivizes both policyholders and auditors to
arrive at fair outcomes and payouts with significantly reduced friction. Although the insurance
platform benefits from the existence of large Trusted Lending Circles, participation in those
groups will not be required for individuals to join a mutual insurance pool.

WeTrust People Ecosystem (added after Daniel Z review)

There are four essential parties in the WeTrust ecosystem: General Users, Sponsors, and
Forepersons. We want to ensure Trustcoins is used properly to incentivise these actors to
behave in a way that fosters growth and integrity on the system. These roles are not mutually
exclusive, and one can wear any or all of these hats.

e General Users use any of our services such as ROSCAs, credit scoring products, or
insurance services. Users are WeTrust’s number one focus, as they determine the
success of the platform. They provide feedback on how to improve, and help understand
how to improve the product. They evangelize and help create the network effect to help
the platform grow cost efficiently.

e Sponsors support the overall development of the platform by participating in the initial
crowdsale, bug bounties, and provide feedback on how the product can be improved.

e Forepersons: The organizer, evangelist, advocate, and product expert on the ground
working with users of the WeTrust Platform. We depend on the Foreperson to educate,
recruit, enforce and coordinate groups. In the ROSCA context, forepersons are allowed
to set their fee rate for the ROSCAs they organize.

App Token

In the spirit of crowdfunding, Trustcoin (TRST) tokens are the currency for services performed
by WeTrust as well as other service providers in the WeTrust ecosystem. The coin is a reward
to any actor that facilitates trust and is paid by any actor that uses the Trust Network. Market
forces and Supply and Demand will dictate the amount of “Trustcoin” per transaction. We Trust
plans to generate fees in TRST from products such as Trusted Lending Circles, Trusted Direct
Lending, and Mutual Insurance in order to support development costs.

App Token usage within Trusted Lending Circles
In the case of our first product, Trusted Lending Circle, while the lending circle itself may be
managed in any currency the group chooses (e.g. ETH, BTC, stablecoins, Trustcoin, etc...), the

services rendered by the foreperson are paid for using TRST tokens.

While creating a Trusted Lending Circle, the foreperson defines the fee in [% of total pot] that
they want to charge, and they get remunerated in TRST. Here is how it’s done:

Consider the following example: a 5 participant, $100 contribution per person Trusted Lending
Circle, a 2% fee (defined by the foreperson) + 0.3% platform fees* would come down to 5 * $100
* 2.3% = $11.5 per round. The platform fees are to support WeTrust’s operations and future
product development.

At the end of every round, when fees are secured from the contributions, TRST coins will be
automatically bought in the exchanges and be held in escrow by the Trusted Lending Circle
contract. When the epoch ends, the foreperson’s fees, as well as WeTrust’s, are released to
them in TRST.

Note that while participants will be able to use the cryptocoin of their choice to run Trusted
Lending Circles, WeTrust will charge a significantly lower fee for Circles that use TRST as the
unit of value, due to the operations being more streamlined. Future products, such as credit
scores, mutual insurance, and direct lending, will also involve fees that are represented in
TRST.

TRST as collateral in the absence of reputation

In a Trusted Lending Circle, the foreperson receives their full fees only if there were no
delinquencies. When some participants are delinquent, the foreperson gets penalized by
reducing the fees that they earn.

To increase the the participants’ confidence in the foreperson’s abilities to gather a group of
trusted associates, the foreperson may put down a collateral, in TRST, that will be distributed to
good-standing participants in case of delinquencies.

As WetTrust builds additional products that involve other roles in the network, they may also be
incentivized to put down collateral in order to perform services (e.g., insurance claims agent).

Trusted Lending Circle fee schedule
The preliminary Trusted Lending Circle Fee schedule for Forepersons and WeTrust is as
follows:

e Forepersons set a fee quoted in Trustcoin (equivalent to 0-5% of distributions)

o In every round, fees are deducted for contributions already secure (adjusting for
delinquencies), converted to TRST (by buying from the market) and reserved for
foreperson. This further incentivizes the foreperson to collect all contributions.

o Atend of an Epoch (i.e. after everyone wins a round), the contract releases the
TRST reserved to the foreperson.

o To further increase the the participants’ confidence in the foreperson’s abilities
(e.g. in the case they don’t know her well beforehand), the foreperson may

4 Note that, in the future WeTrust may offer forepersons the ability to select an alternative fee structure, where only those who
receive interest payments in excess of their deposits are charged a fee on the interests received.
choose to put down a collateral, in TRST, that will be distributed to good-standing
participants in case of delinquencies.

e WeTrust plans to charge 0% fees for small Trusted Lending Circle groups of 5 people or
less

o For groups larger than 5 people, a tier-based, fee schedule will be used. Initial
fees start at 0.3% for running operations and future product development.® The
0.3% fee will be reduced for a given foreperson’s Trusted Lending Circles as
cumulative transaction volumes increase on the Trusted Lending Circles they
manage.

o WetTrust is also exploring other fee structures that forepersons can select, such
as charging fees on the amount of distribution that is in excess of contributions.

Scaling up Trusted Lending Circles

Trusted Lending Circles are built on trust and familiarity. A mechanism to scale up an existing
Trusted Lending Circle, while maintaining trust between its participants is suggested in this
scenario:

Suppose a group of people run successful Trusted Lending Circles multiple times and have trust
in one another. Another person they know less, and thus trust less, wants to join and benefit
from this existing group. WeTrust’s product will allow the new participant to join in a “saver-only”
mode, where they will be able to collect their funds only in the last round (with any additional
interest received during the running of the Trusted Lending Circle).

In this case the group gets a guarantee that the newcomer will pay on time, whereas the
newcomer relies on the group past reputation of paying on time.

Trustcoins allocation:

Prior to reaching a steady state where platform resources can be supported through fees, a
token sale may be utilized to acquire necessary funds to build out the platform. Subsequently,
the WeTrust team expects to utilize funds in the following areas:

e Research. This includes research in mathematics, game theory, statistical and actuarial
models, and computational simulations that will ensure that the proper incentives are in
line for all parties.

e Software Development. This includes budgets for software development, smart
contract development, security reviews and developing a seamless user experience.

5 This number was determined according to current models. WeTrust may change this later depending on market conditions.
e Business Development: This includes expenses for building partnerships with NGOs,
forming and growing Trusted Lending Circle communities, and hiring community
managers to help evangelize around the world.

e Marketing: This includes all expenses related to: Educating the public about our
platform, travel and admission expenses to blockchain conventions, sponsoring
blockchain events / conferences / hackathons, driving users to our platform, developing
the WeTrust brand, and relaying our message to Trusted Lending Circle users.

e External Costs. This includes the token sale structure, security audits, tax/ legal
advisory, regulatory compliance, bug bounties and other fixed costs (office spaces,
telecommuting equipment) associated with technology and development.

100 Million Trustcoins (TRST) will be issued once the crowdsale is concluded. Of the 100 Million
Trustcoins:
e 80 Million Trustcoins will be sold to the token sale participants
e 10 Million Trustcoins will be reserved for the WeTrust team (vesting over 2 years)
e 8 Million Trustcoins will be used to future expenses, marketing, additional team members
e 2 Million Trustcoins will be used for token sale bounties

WeTrust Challenges and Solutions

WeTrust offers a novel and innovative product, and faces diverse challenges. WeTrust
platform’s first product is a Trusted Lending Circle on the blockchain, and this will help bootstrap
the community and social graph. Next, WeTrust’s credit scoring algorithm will allow basic
Trusted Lending Circles to scale and grow/merge with Trusted Lending Circles that have
common connections/trust circles. As such, a large and growing user base is the foundation for
future WeTrust products, such as lending and mutual insurance. Key challenges to growth
include: accessibility, usability and cryptocurrency volatility, anti-fraud measures, and
defensibility of the platform.

Addressing accessibility and cryptocurrency volatility through Stablecoins: The MVP
version of Trusted Lending Circles currently supports usage of Ether and is built on Ethereum,
as it is currently the most mature blockchain to implement smart contracts. Trustcoin and
additional tokens such as stablecoin will be supported in the future as well.

Stablecoins are crypto-tokens whose value is tied to a fiat currency, which we believe is
required to gain mass adoption. In addition, users do not want to deal with cryptocurrency
volatility. Several stablecoins are under development or are in active usage, including
MakerDAl, String Labs Phi, and Tether. Colu and Waves also are working on projects that
enable the support of digital tokens that are linked to fiat value. WeTrust will integrate
stablecoins into its platform as it is critical for large scale adoption and is an important step in
abstracting blockchain/ cryptocurrency from customers.

Addressing fraud through incentives and legal measures: A critical foundation of security
and well-designed incentives are required in any financial ecosystem that intends to deter bad
actors. Governance tools such as legal contracts, collateral risk, loan guarantees, mediation,
and more will be available for each organization to utilize as they see fit. See more information
here.

Addressing defensibility through open and close source strategy: WeTrust operates in an
open-source and decentralized economy, where much of the technology stack is public and
auditable by the community. In this spirit, advantages developed within businesses and
technology will be openly shared with the community. However, in order to ensure sustainability
in our ability to continue dedicating resources to improving the platform, we will open-source the
smart contract to keep WeTrust products transparent and secure and close-source the frontend
to create a barrier to simply forking the project.

Product Road Map/ Budget

The BTC and ETH raised during crowdfunding will be used by Finclusion Labs to build out the
WeTrust Platform products Trusted Lending Circles, Credit Identity and Reputation, Trusted
Direct Lending, and Mutual Insurance.

The amount of financing received would vary significantly between the minimum and the
maximum financing (cap). The roadmap is a full vision to be completed if the cap is reached.
WeTrust should be considered an R&D project involving bleeding-edge technologies.

Although the progress we have already made while developing the Trusted Lending Circle MVP
proves the validity of utilizing blockchain to create decentralized and scalable digitized financial
entities, there is significant work ahead. The WeTrust team is fully committed but the roadmap
and pace of development is also dependant upon the level of success achieved from the
crowdfunding.
In the minimum financing scenario, basic versions of Trusted Lending Circles, Credit Identity,
and Direct Lending/ Borrowing will be created. The ultimate deliverable is enabling users to
create and find ‘circles of trust’ that can be relied upon as a fair marketplace for access to credit.

The maximum financing scenario enables delivery of a much more advanced version of the
above products, and also enables creation of more sophisticated payout terms that resemble
insurance. Close integrations with ongoing blockchain efforts, and investment into global
partnerships will also enable maximum distribution of the services we create. This then enables
a virtuous cycle where the fees generated on the platform will be expected to support the efforts
made by Finclusion Labs, as well as our ability to make grants to organizations that have a
similar vision. Finally, if the funding cap is reached in the crowdfunding, the WeTrust team will
also be able to create specific integrations useful to the entire community.

WeTrust Roadmap is the following, however the timing will depend on the amount of funds that
are raised in the crowdsale. The Roadmap below assumes a fundraising amount near the
maximum amount; detailed features vs funding documentation is within the whitepaper

WeTrust Team consists solely of employment costs. We assume that with maximum financing
we will be able to finance a team up to 20 people (mostly developers) for a period of 4 years.

Office and indirect costs includes costs of offices in San Francisco Bay Area, as well as other
indirect, employment-related costs.

Contractors covers all third parties we will need to work with. This includes security audits,
legal, and accounting services.

Community, Marketing, and Partnerships are related to WeTrust’s expansion plan. This
includes both communication and marketing efforts to get new communities involved, supporting
(financing or co-financing) third party integrations with WeTrust, and building partnerships with
external partners that WeTrust depends on for customer acquisition, and building brand equity.

Contingency fund is calculated as ~10% of the total budget

Go to market strategy (added after Daniel Z review)

Immediately following a successful crowdfunding event, the WeTrust team will get on the
ground and publicize our prototype (rosca.WeTrust.io) to immigrant communities in the Silicon
Valley, and collaborate with NGOs who facilitate Lending Circles. WeTrust has secured a
contractual relationship with growmyfuture.org who has a strong presence in the bay area and
strong connections with other NGOs, with whom we plan to build partnerships. This represents
the phase where we refine our product based on customer use, interaction and feedback.
Refining our product with bay area immigrant communities is ideal because they are both
technologically savvy, yet also know of the traditions back home and most of their parents have
participated in these lending circles before. Concurrently, we will also be incorporating the use
of other tokens (various stablecoins under development) to alleviate concerns regarding
volatility.

After refining our product after collaborating with NGOs in the US, we plan to expand globally
and work with their overseas branches in India, Africa, etc... Partnering with NGOs such as
Gates Foundation will provide credibility to our product due to brand equity of NGOs who have
built a strong presence in our target communities. Michael Casey (advisor at MIT’s Digital
Currency Initiative) is on our team and has strong ties to NGOS - specifically Financial Inclusion
organizations globally - and we will collaborate with his organization to accelerate development.

Blockchain Benefits

Why choose the blockchain as infrastructure?

A blockchain-based financial-social platform reduces the friction (high fees, low liquidity,
accounting records, potential fraud from organizers) and automates an existing concept already
proven in communities worldwide. We foresee that blockchain technology will impact the
financial sectors in the following core areas:

1. Efficiency and Automation. Smart contract technology enables end-to-end automation
of payments, efficient risk model estimation, and decentralized claims processing. This
substantially lowers operating costs.

2. Greater Access for the Underbanked/Underserved. A more connected world will
enable those in developing markets, low-income businesses, and new product verticals
to leapfrog into cutting edge technology. For example, in Kenya, M-PESA[12] has
created a simple banking system on feature phones, completely bypassing the need for
brick and mortar bank branches.

3. All-Inclusive Digital Identity. Digital identities on Blockchains create opportunities for
individuals to transact across international borders without the hassles of conflicting
governance.

4. Transparency. On most blockchains, transparency is a platform-level feature. All data in
a smart contract based system is publicly auditable and can be freely analyzed by third
parties, while preserving privacy as required.

5. Experimentation. With open source code, permission-less usage, wide array of
customization options, and ease of accounting, groups of trusted associates can
experiment and create unique structures/rules according to their circumstances. Groups
with a common cause, ranging from university alumni groups, volunteer groups, veterans
associations, social activists, political groups, religious groups, etc... can use a simple
app to leverage and engage their respective communities with tangible financial impact.

Rotating Savings and Credit projects outside of the blockchain

Several companies have tried to create tools and software similar to a Trusted Lending
Circle, including eMoneyPool, Puddle, Monk, and Savemates. However, these solutions
integrate with the traditional banking system, and require the use of bank accounts, which are
typically only usable within a single jurisdiction. Some other drawbacks include:

e Most current participants of Trusted Lending Circles do not have access to banking
services, which are a prerequisite to these tools and software

e Existing software providers prevent savers from earning a return on their deposit. This
shortcoming takes away from the spirit of the Rotating Savings and Credit group, which
thrives on the supply/demand dynamic that benefits both savers and borrowers.

e Smaller markets and jurisdictions suffer from lack of attention and do not benefit from
these apps that are being developed.

By building a decentralized application on the blockchain, we are able to eliminate costs
associated with transfers to/from bank accounts, and can reach populations who do not have
access to bank accounts. The application can be used in any jurisdiction, and Trusted Lending
Circles can be formed among trusted associates across borders. This enables the creation of a
more accurate social graph and trust inference data that can be used for a safer and rewarding
experience for users. Lastly, unlike existing solutions, the WeTrust dApp is decentralized, funds
are controlled by the users, and each Trusted Lending Circle can determine their own rules for
distribution, maximum interest rates, and policies according to their local needs and traditions.

Potential Market Size

To estimate the potential market size for a financial-social platform one needs to take
into account the different community-based financial infrastructure in play globally
today, and future demands that might arise due to the emergence of WeTrust as an
alternative financial solution.

The global ROSCA and informal banking industry is responsible for money flows over 10% of
GDP in many countries, despite significant handling/transaction costs. An estimated >$500B
flow through Trusted Lending Circle type groups each year, as detailed below.

In addition, social capital powered Trusted Lending Circles have potential compete in consumer
loans, where the US market represents over $3.2 Trillion in outstanding consumer credit[13].
Globally, the P2P Lending market is growing rapidly and has a market size of over $70B/ year
(also, detailed below). Finally, WeTrust plans to deliver insurance services built on the Trusted
Lending Circles, which can be seen as the foundation for a mutual insurance framework. The
insurance industry[14] generated over $1.1 Trillion in premiums in the United States in 2015.

AMERICA

Figure 2: A conservative estimate of the ROSCA-Trusted Lending Circles and P2P lending markets size
globally.

India: Formal banking institutions reach only ~15% of the population, and over $200 B is
distributed via regulated and unregulated ROSCAs, known as Chit Funds, where over 15,000
are registered entities, with a significantly larger unregulated Chit Fund sector[15]. Fees range
from 5-10% of distribution, with thousands employed in the industry[16] and scams costing over
$10B in recent years[17]. P2P lending is still in its infancy with over 30 companies[18] currently
offering competing services.

China: A vast amount of lending is conducted via informal networks, with tech enabled P2P
lending exceeding $60B/ yr[19] and conservative estimates of overall unregulated lending at
over $2T/ year with at least 5% going through ROSCA-like entities and Lending Circles[20].

Latin America: Trusted Lending Circles are used across Mexico (cundinas), Brazil (pandeiros),
Peru, and Argentina. Estimates of informal bank lending volumes exceed $150B/ yr[21].

USA: while accurate estimates are not available, anecdotal evidence shows 50-80% of recent
immigrants from Latin America[22], Asian and West Indies communities participate in some form
of informal lending and Trusted Lending Circle type arrangements[23]. ROSCAs and Trusted
Lending Circles have transaction volume exceeding $30 B/ yr and online P2P lending exceeds
~$10 B/ yr[24].

According to the 2015 FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households, [25]
7.0% of households in the United States were unbanked in 2015. This proportion represents
approximately 9.0 million households. An additional 19.9% of U.S. households (24.5 million)
were underbanked, meaning that the household had a checking or savings account but also
obtained financial products and services outside of the banking system.

In general, there is increasing interest in alternative financial companies in the United States, as
evidenced by Lemonade Insurance company in New York City (lemonade.com), a P2P
insurance company that recently raised $13m in Aug 2016 and an additional $34m in Dec
2016[26].

Technical Aspects

WeTrust is characterized by three key operational pillars: autonomous, frictionless and
decentralized.

Autonomous: Smart contracts run the business logic autonomously, and we will utilize these
features for fast, secure and reliable processing of the detailed product processes. This will
reduce the friction currently observed due to the numerous fees and operation costs imposed by
middlemen, such as financial institutions.

Unlike existing centralized platforms and services, WeTrust’s transactions are publicly verifiable,
viewable, self-operated, and not subject to the risk of mishandling by organizers. Our system is
a finite-state machine. Each transaction (i.e. create a fund, contribute, bid, and disburse...) will
transform the system to a defined and predictable state. Our smart contract functions do not
produce non-deterministic behaviors.

Frictionless: Traditional Trusted Lending Circle processes have been cumbersome and
manual, resulting in high fees, and occasional fraud in the Lending Circle industry. The WeTrust
platform focuses on delivering good and friendly experiences to our end-users and developers.
We design and build an abstraction layer on top of the underlying blockchain so that developers
and customers do not even know they are running on decentralized servers and blockchain
technology. Furthermore, we introduce SDk's in different programming languages to help users
integrate with our platform, create and manage funds easily. Here is an example of how one
could create a Trusted Lending Circle fund in JavaScript:
var TrustedLendingCircle = require('TrustedLendingCircle');
var options = {
name: 'example1',
startDate: 2016-10-10,
endDate: 2016-11-10
}
var fund = TrustedLendingCircle.initFund(options);
fund.addUser(TrustedLendingCircle.findUser(‘#abc’)); // User #abc is a member of TrustedLendingCircle platform
fund.addForeperson(TrustedLendingCircle.findUser(‘#xyz')); // User #xyz is a member of TrustedLendingCircle
platform
fund.start();

Decentralized: Traditional online businesses with centralized structures are subject to hacking
and onerous overhead costs. Decentralized fund management, auction arbitration, contribution
tracking, and distribution of funds enables elimination of reliance on payment processors,
reduces costs associated with fees and bureaucracy, and protects against fraud. Building on top
of an Ethereum platform, our entities are based on ‘Smart Contracts’. The detailed architecture
of the platform is further described in the diagram below.

User 1 User n

Proxy-Controller

TLC-Fund 0 TLC-Fund n

Figure 3: Trusted Lending Circle (TLC) dApp Architecture
User: A smart contract that stores the user’s information and history of Trusted Lending Circle the user participates
in. These records will help determine the credit score of the user and/or match him/her with available public Trusted
Lending Circle funds. Proxy-Controller: A smart contract to manage users of the Trusted Lending Circle platform
and their interactions with the Funds. This contract mostly contains authentication and authorization logic as well as
permissions management. TLC-Fund: A smart contract that store all the states of a Trusted Lending Circle fund
(e.g., Foreperson, members, term, conditions, status, contributions) and contain business logic to operate the fund
(e.g., manage the contribution, bidding and disbursement)

Security

Since users’ hard earned money is at stake, security is treated with the highest priority at
WeTrust. In order to ensure that underlying smart contracts that move funds are secure and
working as intended, the WeTrust team commits to subjecting its platform to a comprehensive
security audit and bounty programs prior to launching the platform to the public. We will hire the
most reputable security experts to conduct security audits prior to our public launch, release all
results of the audit and fix any flaws that are identified.

In addition, WeTrust will build a dedicated server to monitor all transactions on our platform
anonymously. This server will detect and address suspect behaviors and fraudulent activities.
Alert notifications will be automatically set up and will alert developers around the world to fix
any known incidents.

Sybil Attack Prevention

Because WeTrust is a community-based platform that relies on its users' performance in
products such as Trusted Lending Circles and P2P lending to generate credit scores, it is
important for us to preserve the integrity of the scores by thwarting Sybil Attacks from
automatically created fraudulent accounts. It would be detrimental to our platform if one person
created fake profiles and Trusted Lending Circles to generate a legitimate credit score. WeTrust
offers some potential solutions:

1. Require users to provide identity information from off-blockchain sources such as:
Facebook, Twitter, or Cell Phone (activated through two-factor authentication).

2. For each account, we will allow a limited number of “free” Trusted Lending Circle funds.
Any additional Trusted Lending Circles will require a small fee. Further, Trusted Lending
Circles will be required to be of a minimum size. This would require individuals with
malicious intent to actually contribute into a fund and pay the service fees.

The first dApp - Trusted Lending Circle (aka ROSCA):

The WeTrust Trusted Lending Circle is powered by smart contracts and blockchain technology.
This savings and credit platform allows users to lend and borrow from each other at
self-determined interest rates with minimal friction. The immediate purposes that the WeTrust
Trusted Lending Circle will serve:

e As an affordable path for the two billion “unbanked” to obtain and track savings & credit
e Create a competitive alternative asset class for savers
e Facilitate group savings as a more effective way to reach individual saving goals[27]

This product will serve multiple audiences. The main audiences are a) the unbanked who need
access to credit and b) those who do have access to formal financial institutions, but desire
alternative solutions to saving and credit.
Why start with Trusted Lending Circle as WeTrust’s first dApp?

Marketplaces can succeed if there is a balance between supply and demand and critical mass
is required from day one if users are to find usefulness in the WeTrust Platform. This begs the
inevitable “chicken and egg problem” in which a strong network is essential before users join
and vice versa. To overcome this problem, we believe a Trusted Lending Circle product is the
ideal vanguard dApp as it facilitates network effects and leverages existing networks/ behavior
norms.

Product design: high level summary

When users first visit the Trusted Lending Circle (ROSCA) dApp, they would be prompted to
create an account. After this they can create a ROSCA in which they are the foreperson and
invite participants (e.g., via whatsapp, email), or join a ROSCA they were invited to. Invitees are
also required to create an account before they can join a ROSCA and become active
participants. It should be noted that both parties (forepersons and participants), must access the
dApp using a compatible browser, which is connected to funded Ethereum accounts.

Once a ROSCA has been created, and participants have joined, the foreperson can deploy the
ROSCA smart contract onto the blockchain. This action solidifies the details of the ROSCA, and
no further edits can be made after this point. Once the smart contract has been deployed, the
foreperson can begin the ROSCA on or after the predefined start date.

Both participants and foreperson participate in the ROSCA by submitting transactions to the
contract. These transactions take the form of starting the round (foreperson only), contributions,
bids and withdrawals. Each transaction must originate from the address with which the user
joined or created the ROSCA. ROSCA participants are able to see a complete list of these
transactions, up to and after the end of the Trusted Lending Circle-ROSCA epoch.

Deposits and Withdrawals

Users will deposit from their own wallet to the unique address of the ROSCA smart contract
during each round. Any withdrawals are initiated with a transaction, and sent to the address
which originated said transaction.

Trusted Lending Circle-ROSCA dApp walkthrough

The following is a walkthrough of the Trusted Lending Circle-ROSCA MVP as of whitepaper

Ul/ UX will undergo continuous improvement based on community feedback and input.
The current Trusted Lending Circle product will be accessible through the web. Upon visiting the
site, users will be presented with an explanation about what a Trusted Lending Circle is, and
how the blockchain brings advantages to traditional Trusted Lending Circles. Once logged in,
users are presented with their dashboard, which consists of three lists of ROSCAs: ROSCAs
they have created; ROSCAs they have joined as a participant; and ROSCAs they have been
invited to.

‘Create a ROSCA’: If you want to organize and create a Trusted Lending Circle for you and
your friends, start here. We will call the initiator the ‘foreperson’. Creating a new Trusted
Lending Circle allows the foreperson to specify the terms of the Trusted Lending Circle, detailed
as follows:

1. ROSCA Name: This is a name given to identify the Trusted Lending Circle, for ease of
use.

2. Number of Participants: The number of other participants that the foreperson is going
to invite. After entering this number, fields appear where the user can enter the email
addresses of the other participants.
3. Payment Frequency: The frequency of the payments made by all participants. In the
future we plan to open this up to be more flexible. Each round lasts for the amount of
time specified here (e.g. a weekly payment frequency would result in week-long rounds).

4. Payment Amount: The amount in Ether which all participants must contribute each
round. The MVP supports only Ether, WeTrust is planning to enable use of other tokens
in the future

5. Start Date: The date on and after which the ROSCA can be started. It should be noted
the ROSCA must be deployed at least three full days before this date, to protect against
blockchain timestamp discrepancies.

Glossary

e Rotating Credit and Savings Association (ROSCA): Also known as a Trusted Lending
Circle, a ROSCA is a group of individuals who act as an alternative financing institution
through regular contributions and withdrawals from a common fund. The name Rotating
Credit and Savings Association, comes from the type of transactions that occur in these
associations in which members contribute on a regular basis (e.g., once a month) and
are allowed a chance at the pot each contribution period.

e Epoch: A full cycle of contributions, where the Epoch timeframe is equal to

o — [# of participants ]* [regular contribution interval]
For example, if there are 6 members, and the contribution is weekly, then one Epoch is
equal to 6 weeks. Typically a member wins the pot once in each Epoch.

e Foreperson: The Foreperson is the individual who initiates the ‘ROSCA Fund’. It is this
person who will input the fund’s specifications, input contact information, and be
responsible for educating participants about the process, and eventually make sure the
contributions are made.

e Foreperson Fee: This is the agreed upon rate that the group wants to pay the
Foreperson for organizing the group.

e Platform Fee: This is the fee that will be collected by the platform to cover operational
costs and development costs, with excess fees going to grants, scholarships, and other
non-profit pursuits.

Appendix
ROSCAs Around the World

Trusted Lending Circles-ROSCAs have existed for many years now. In Japan, the earliest
records of ROSCA - with contributions in money - date back as far as 1275[28], in Korea they
may even go back to the 9th century[29].

ROSCAs are currently popular in regions where there are a lack of sophisticated investment
options and where there is difficulty in accessing loans through formal institutions -- typically
because credit scores either do not exist or do not play a meaningful role in an individual’s
financial health. In India and China for example, it is common for alumni from a common
university, colleagues from the same company, or simply friends from the same city to create
informal ROSCAs as a way to save and invest. Research indicates that informal ROSCAs have
similar or lower default rates for loans when compared to formal institutions, and offer
competitive returns on investment for savers. ROSCAs are increasingly also being used to
address the continuing phenomenon of low interest rates and uncertain strength of centralized
institutions.

Trusted Lending Circles exist in various incarnations around the world. Here are some
examples:

As “Chit Funds”: In India, each State has a regulatory agency for “Chit Funds” that are
responsible for setting rules such as: maximum fees, capital reserve requirements, fund
registration, insurance/ bonded requirements, etc. Kerala State Financial Enterprise is a
government-owned ROSCA fund of Kerala State and is one of the largest funds in India.
They employ over 6,000 employees and in fiscal 2015, have substantial operational
costs. Currently, financial enterprises in India are large and sophisticated; however,
WeTrust believes our technology can reduce costs, yet still preserve transparency,
compliance with regulators, and safety. [5,10]

As “Tanda”: In Latin America and United States, particularly amongst the migrant
worker community from Latin America, workers are employing this group saving concept
to help save for their retirement. According to Jeffrey Cheung, President and CEO of
OneCalifornia Bank, “[Tandas] really does hit on the fundamental of lending. Is the
person you are lending money to someone you can trust? Someone who is honorable,
someone who you think will pay you back?"[30] "[Tandas] are a worldwide phenomenon
for poor people whose access to capital is limited. [/f] easiest way to do it is to pool your
resources," said Carlos Vélez-lbafez, Anthropologist at Arizona State University[31].

As “Hui” or “Shadow Banks”: Earliest mention of Hui is found in the Han Dynasty[1].
Since the Tang Dynasty in China, during the spread of Buddhism, the Chit fund tradition
also spread from India. Currently, there is a booming “shadow banking” sector in which
over $14.5 trillion yuan ($2.2 trillion dollars) are managed informally. This equates to
roughly a quarter of all total loans originating in China and is worrying regulators
because these loans are often highly leveraged and borrowers are typically less
credit-worthy. Again, similar to the case in India, China is another huge market that will
benefit from the transparency, auditability and safety the Blockchain can provide[32,33].

consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever arising directly or indirectly from: (i)
reliance on any information contained in this document, (ii) any error, omission or inaccuracy in
any such information or (iii) any action resulting from such information.

WetTrust Token, ("Trustcoin"), is a cryptographic token used by the WeTrust network, operated
by Finclusion Labs, Inc. (the "Company".

Trustcoin IS NOT A SECURITY AND THIS IS NOT AN OFFER TO SELL A SECURITY.
Trustcoin IS NOT AN INVESTMENT AND SHOULD NOT BE PURCHASED AS AN
INVESTMENT.

If you purchase Trustcoin you certify that you are doing so out of a desire to use or consume
Trustcoin on the WeTrust network, to participate in the WeTrust community, or to attempt to
personally generate any consideration by using Trustcoin on the network or in the community.
You certify that you are not purchasing Trustcoin for any speculative, investment or other
financial reasons.

Trustcoin is not a cryptocurrency of value. At the time of this writing, Trustcoin (i) cannot be
exchanged for goods or services, (ii) has no known uses outside the WeTrust network, and (iii)
cannot be traded on any known exchanges.

There is no guarantee — indeed there is no reason to believe — that the Trustcoin you purchase
will increase in value. Trustcoin MAY — AND LIKELY WILL — DECREASE IN VALUE.
Trustcoin is not evidence of ownership in, or right to control, the Company or the WeTrust
network.

Holding or using Trustcoin does not grant you ownership or equity in the Company or the
WetTrust network. Trustcoin does not grant any right to participate in the control, direction or
decision-making of the Company or the WeTrust network.

1) Risk of Losing Access to Trustcoin Due to Loss of Credentials

The purchaser's Trustcoin may be associated with a WeTrust account until it is distributed to the
purchaser. The WeTrust account can only be accessed with login credentials selected by the
purchaser. The loss of these credentials will result in the loss of Trustcoin. Loss of credentials
associated with any third party and or digital wallet containing and or controlling Trustcoin will
result in loss of Trustcoin. Best practices dictate that purchasers safely store credentials in one
or more backup locations geographically separated from the working location.

2) Risks Associated with the Ethereum Protocol
Trustcoin and the WeTrust network are based on the Ethereum protocol. As such, any
malfunction, unintended function or unexpected functioning of the Ethereum protocol may cause
the WeTrust network or Trustcoin to malfunction or function in an unexpected or unintended
manner. Ether, the native unit of account of the Ethereum Protocol, may itself lose value, which
could have a negative impact on the functioning of the WeTrust network. More information
about the Ethereum protocol is available at http://www.ethereum.org.

3) Risks Associated with Purchaser Credentials

Any third party that gains access to the purchaser's login credentials or private keys may be
able to dispose of or misappropriate the purchaser’s Trustcoin. To minimize this risk, the
purchaser should guard against unauthorized access to their electronic devices.

4) Risk of Unfavorable Regulatory Action in One or More Jurisdictions

Blockchain technologies have been the subject of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies around
the world. The functioning of the WeTrust network and Trustcoin could be impacted by one or
more regulatory inquiries or actions, including, but not limited to, restrictions on the use or
possession of digital tokens like Trustcoin, which could impede or limit the development of the
WeTrust network.

ROSCAs and facilitating Trusted Lending Circles is a core business of the Company, have
been, and will likely continue to be, the subject of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies around
the world. The legal ability for the Company to operate the WeTrust network in some or all
jurisdictions could be eliminated by future regulation or legal actions. In the event that it is not
legal for the WeTrust network to operate in a jurisdiction, the Company will cease operations in
that jurisdiction. There is a serious risk that the Company will be unable to operate if regulation
makes it difficult to do so.

5) Risk of Alternative, Unofficial WeTrust Networks

Following the presale and the development of the initial version of the Trustcoin platform and
WetTrust network, it is possible that alternative networks could be established, which utilize the
same open source code and open source protocol underlying the WeTrust network. The official
WerTrust network may compete with these alternative, unofficial Trustcoin-based networks,
which could potentially negatively impact the WeTrust network and Trustcoin.

6) Risk of Insufficient Interest in the WeTrust Network or Distributed Applications

It is possible that the WeTrust network will not be used by a large number of businesses,
individuals, and other organizations and that there will be limited public interest in the creation
and development of distributed applications. Such a lack of interest could impact the
development of the WeTrust network and therefore the potential uses or utility of Trustcoin.

7) Risk that the WeTrust Network, As Developed, Will Not Meet the Expectations of the
Purchaser

The WeTrust network is presently under development and may undergo significant changes
before release. Any expectations regarding the form and functionality of Trustcoin or the
WerTrust network held by the purchaser may not be met upon release for any number of
reasons, including a change in the design and implementation plans and execution of the
WerTrust network.

8) Risk of Theft and Hacking

Hackers or other groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the WeTrust network or
the availability of Trustcoin in any number of ways, including, but not limited to, denial of service
attacks, Sybil attacks, spoofing, smurfing, malware attacks, or consensus-based attacks.

9) Risk of Security Weaknesses in the Trustcoin network Core Infrastructure Software

The WeTrust network consists of open-source software that is itself based on open-source
software. There is a risk that the Company team or other third parties may intentionally or
unintentionally introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of the
WetTrust network interfering with the use of or causing the loss of Trustcoin.

10) Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of Cryptography

Advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum
computers, could present risks to cryptographic tokens and the WeTrust platform, which could
result in the theft or loss of Trustcoin.

11) Risk of Trustcoin Mining Attacks

As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens, the blockchain used for the WeTrust network
is susceptible to mining attacks, including, but not limited, to double-spend attacks, majority
mining power attacks, "selfish-mining"” attacks, and race condition attacks. Any successful
attacks present a risk to the WeTrust network, including, but not limited to, expected proper
execution and sequencing of Ethereum contract computations and the WeTrust network .
Despite the efforts of the Company, the risk of known or novel mining attacks exists.

12) Risk of Lack of Adoption or Use of the WeTrust Network

While Trustcoin should not be viewed as an investment, it may potentially (but likely will not)
have utility value over time. That value may be limited or nonexistent if the WeTrust network
lacks use and adoption.

13) Risk of an Unfavorable Fluctuation of Ethereum Ether ("ETH") and Other Currency Value
The Company team intends to use the proceeds of the Trustcoin presale to fund development of
the WeTrust network. The proceeds of the Trustcoin presale will be denominated in BTC and
ETH, and converted into other cryptographic and fiat currencies. If the value of BTC, ETH or
other currencies fluctuates unfavorably during or after the presale, the Company team may not
be able to fund development, or may not be able to develop the Trustcoin network in the
manner that it intended or promised.

14) Risk of an Illiquid Market for Trustcoin

There are currently no exchanges upon which Trustcoin might be resold and such exchanges
may never exist. If ever exchanges do develop, they will likely be relatively new and subject to
poorly-understood regulatory oversight. They may therefore be more exposed to fraud and
failure than established, regulated exchanges for other products.

15) Risk of Uninsured Losses

Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions, Trustcoins associated

with a WeTrust account are uninsured. In the event of loss or loss of utility value, there is no

public insurer, such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or private insurer, to offer
recourse to the purchaser.

16) Risk of Dissolution of the WeTrust Project

It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, without limitation, an unfavorable
fluctuation in the value of Ether (or other cryptographic and fiat currencies), decrease in the
utility value of Trustcoin, the failure of business relationships, or competing intellectual property
claims, the WeTrust network may no longer be a viable business and the Company may
dissolve or the WeTrust network may fail to launch.

17) Risk of Malfunction in the WeTrust Network
It is possible that the WeTrust network malfunctions in an unfavorable way, including, but not
limited to, one that results in the loss of Trustcoin, confidential information, or personal data.

18) Unanticipated Risks

Cryptographic tokens are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks included in this
Risk Disclosure, there are other risks, including those that the Company cannot anticipate. Risks
may further materialize as unanticipated combinations or variations of the discussed risks.

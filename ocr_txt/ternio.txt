WHY BLOCKCHAIN IS NEEDED

INTRODUCTION

The digital advertising industry as we know it today faces many challenges; domain fraud,
bot traffic, lack of transparency, and lengthy payment models. It is a complex and ever
evolving environment for advertisers and publishers alike to navigate through. Ternio was
born out of necessity to streamline and bring clarification to both sides of the table.

Ternio is a blockchain based utility token built to transform and ultimately disrupt the $224
billion per year digital advertising market [1] through a multifaceted approach. Incentives
and the general ecosystem are not aligned causing both advertisers and publishers to feel
they are on the losing side of the deal. Ternio provides a verifiable and decentralized
asset that empowers advertisers to verify spend through each intermediary and gives
publishers the assurance and guarantee of being paid on delivery. With advertisers
knowing that they are getting what they pay for and publishers not having to wait months
to collect, Ternio stands in the forefront of a new digital advertising revolution.

TERNIO: The name itself means “A Series of Three” representing all 3 aspects of the
digital advertising ecosystem: User, Publisher, Advertiser. In 2017, with a long list of
opportunities, we got to work in what we felt would reshape how digital advertising receives
users, works with publishers, and assists advertisers. What currently takes many
ad-technology companies to achieve together, Ternio has achieved within a single
lightweight blockchain system: speed, scaling, transparency, payments, invoicing, fraud
prevention, programmatic advertising, and the availability for advertisers to be directly
connected to publishers without being forced to use 3rd parties.

While there are other blockchains focused on building solutions for the digital advertising
industry, none have been able to address the problem of scaling that mainstream digital
advertising requires. Through a patent-pending process, Ternio has solved this problem
by utilizing a series of mechanisms and blockchains to achieve incredibly high transaction
rates that are required for programmatic digital advertising.

Ternio was created to not only streamline the process between advertisers and publishers,
but also assist any ad technology platform currently on the market.

TERN:O i
WHY BLOCKCHAIN IS NEEDED

Our intention from the very beginning has been not to create another walled garden and
centralized system. Ternio was built for easy integration with any digital advertising-based
company’s current platform that looks to provide additional services and transparency as a
service to their customers.

COMPLETE PROGRAMMATIC TRANSPARENCY OF
THE SUPPLY CHAIN

Today’s programmatic advertising market is made up of a series of layers, with the brand
(Advertiser) positioned at the top layer and the publisher situated on the bottom. In
between these layers, there are numerous additional layers that a brand’s ad campaign will
travel through before eventually reaching the publisher's website and ultimately the user.
Each of these additional layers take a cut of the revenue for themselves before passing on
to the next layer. Sometimes - these layers provide limited or no value to the brand’s ad
campaign. Ternio will enable the brand, publisher, and all layers within the supply chain to
understand the value being provided. Through complete transparency of the Lexicon
blockchain, if the supply chain decides that a certain layer is not providing value, then as
a natural progression the order of the supply chain reforms to the path of least resistance
and greater efficiency.

ADVERTISER TRADING PUBLISHER
DESK

The following page displays a simplified diagram of the transparency process. The brand
works with a Demand Side Platform (DSP) who will buy media for the brand’s campaign.
The DSP usually adds in Audience Data and Fraud Verification from 3rd parties at an
additional cost to the brand. The DSP then buys media on a Supply Side Platform (SSP)
who charges for their services. The SSP then passes the campaign on to the Publisher
who finally displays the brand’s campaign.

WHY BLOCKCHAIN IS NEEDED

Ternio is not proposing to be another layer in this scenario. Rather we complement the
existing supply chain by bringing full transparency into the costs associated with each

layer.

Ternio can supply the SSP, DSP, and brand with a track-back mechanism to be
implemented on their side. When enabled, Ternio is able to combine the data from the
multiple layers into the single impression blockchain contract. Please view technical
details for more information on this subject.* Since the contract itself is immutable and
decentralized, the entire supply chain from start to finish becomes fully transparent to all
parties involved. Through our Lexicon blockchain, each contract uses cryptography to
encrypt the data ensuring that only direct parties within the supply chain have access to
this privileged information. This limits competitors or outside parties from viewing a
supply chain’s records within a given day’s contracts while simultaneously ensuring each
record is fully transparent to everyone within the supply chain.

WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT:

eco We have resolved the blockchain scalability issue within the digital advertising
ecosystem which has been a major hurdle in preventing broader adoption.

coo We are the first to offer the ability and guarantee of NetO payments for all parts
of the ad supply chain as a standard. No more payment float to prop up
companies.

eco We are the first to offer a blockchain solution for all programmatic digital ad

protocols. Our patent-pending Ternio blockchain technology is the first to
overcome scalability within the programmatic environment.

eco Ternio currently has an agreement in place to work with at least one ad
technology company immediately after completion of the Initial Coin Offering
and is in discussion with others. Ternio will be live to publishers and
advertisers in the digital advertising environment June 2018.

eco Ternio has multiple fraud prevention mechanisms built into our revolutionary
blockchain technology.

coo We have a comprehensive plan to promote early adoption with advertisers, ad
agencies, and ad technology companies.

“Better advertising and media transparency are closely related. Why? Because better

advertising requires time and money, yet we’re all wasting way too much time and
money on a media supply chain with poor standards adoption, too many players
grading their own homework, too many hidden touches, and too many holes to allow
criminals to rip us off,” [2]

THE OPPORTUNITY

THE OPPORTUNITY

Like in the days of the beginning of the internet, the world is on the cusp of a new kind of
digital revolution. A revolution in which the way that we all transact - computers and
humans alike, is about to change forever. Fast, secure, trustworthy transactions now
become a standard, and the way advertising itself is transacted.

As new technologies continue to arise, the pace in which new technology is adopted has
been ever increasing. It took almost 50 years for the telephone to reach 50% of U.S.
households, 20 years for the internet and 10 years for the modern smartphone.[5] No
longer do we speak of innovation as just tangible products, but now digital products that
multitudes of teams are able to collaborate together from around the world to create
innovation in a fraction of the time and with a fraction of the capital cost.

Whether it’s how you watch television, do your banking, communicate with household
items from your phone, or build applications for the web, blockchain itself has become the
new building block in which almost all digital devices will be built on top of in the future.

The internet as an enterprise needed time to evolve and mature; the beginning stages
faced many issues and setbacks that were eventually resolved and is now projected to
have 4.4 trillion in sales in 2021. Blockchain technology’s evolution curve is very similar
to that of the early internet. There have been scalability issues in terms of the maximum
number of transactions that could be accomplished per second, disastrous environmental
issues from the impact of “proof of work” mining, and the cost of having to pay for each
transaction. In order for a blockchain solution to be feasible in the digital advertising
industry — low transaction limitations and paying costs for each ad transaction simply isn’t
feasible.

Ternio has completely solved these problems with a proprietary advancement in the
underlying blockchain technology. By resolving these issues Ternio is positioned to be the
ideal utility token to revolutionize the digital advertising market and bring clarity to an
otherwise murky ecosystem.

The Ternio blockchain system through our Lexicon blockchain utilizes smart
contracts. Those smart contracts can be viewed up and down the entire supply
chain.

“Advertisers must have a practical, scalable way to verify delivery, verify costs
and supply.”

The Ternio blockchain maintains an audit report showing breakdowns of pricing
in the ecosystem and verifies delivery of ads.

“Advertisers must secure a source of independent transactional info for their

THE OPPORTUNITY

BLOCKCHAIN FOR DIGITAL ADVERTISING &
PROGRAMMATIC

2017 was the first year where digital ad spend exceeded that of any other medium in the
United States having grown from 17.1% of total spend in 2010 to 37% of total spend in
2017; digital ad spend is projected to be 44.9% of total ad spend in 2020 and 49.9% of
total ad spend in 2021.[3]

E-marketer projects that digital advertising spend in the U.S. alone will increase from $83
billion in 2017 to $129 billion in 2021 with double digit increases each year.[4] Total digital
advertising spend (not including Facebook and Google) was over $30 billion in 2017 alone
and continuing to grow rapidly.

Surveys have found that much of the digital ad spend increases are coming at the
expense of reducing budgets in either television, radio or print advertising.

And while digital ad spend continues to rapidly increase — there remain many issues within
the advertising supply chain. First — by 2019 - 77% of all digital ad $ are estimated to be
spent programmatically[3], but a recent analysis by the Association of National
Advertisers found that publishers only receive $.58 for every $1 spent on programmatic
advertising; 58% of all digital ad spend is consumed by the intermediaries that make up
the ad supply chain.[3]

Not only is the current ad supply chain highly inefficient — a study commissioned by WPP
(one of the world’s largest advertising agencies) found that global ad fraud could be as
high as $16 billion in 2017.[4] Addressing the issues of fraud and an inefficient supply
chain are two of the most important goals agreed upon by both legitimate publishers and
advertisers.

Programmatic advertising itself makes up 75% of all digital advertising in the market
encompassing display, video, OTT and other forms of digital media. The industry uses
real-time bidding (RTB), VPAID/VAST and other protocols to deliver ads to users. Ternio
was built with the intention of being agnostic to the advertising medium. This means that
not only can

Ternio integrate with a wide variety of advertising protocols, but also be the first
blockchain solution in the marketplace that will work work seamlessly with programmatic
digital advertising.

“Blockchain may have a bigger impact than anything marketers have encountered
since the advent of the internet.

~David Berkowitz, Chief Strategy Officer at Sysomos”

INSTANT, GUARANTEED PUBLISHER
TRANSACTIONS

The payment system for digital advertising is highly undesired and inefficient. Due to
multiple factors including the number of intermediaries and the anachronistic order
process between each connection within the supply chain — not only do publishers receive
far less in terms of payment relative to the total ad dollars spent, but it’s common to wait
60 to 90 days before the publisher receives payment. The Ternio blockchain has been
designed to allow for everyone within the supply chain to not only be paid instantly but
also have that payment guaranteed. To guarantee payment, advertisers and ad
technology companies must prepay in TERN (Ternio Tokens) which will be registered as
credits to their account. Publishers can then know and trust that their payment is
guaranteed since the market holds TERN to a value and the transparency of ledgers hold
both sides accountable. View “Lexicon Blockchain” for more information about digital
Insertion Orders (lO) and Smart Contracts.

THE OPPORTUNITY

CONNECTING ADVERTISERS DIRECTLY WITH
PUBLISHERS

There are rarely direct relationships between advertisers and publishers, and agencies
regularly complain about the lack of transparency as to where their money is being spent.
The Ternio blockchain ensures absolute transparency of impressions, payments, and
costs. The Lexicon blockchain and the use of smart contracts ensure that the advertiser's
specifications are met by the supply. Ternio can be utilized with any existing ad exchange
that integrates the blockchain mechanism or utility tokens as stated on the roadmap for
Q1 2019. Ternio will push adoption of the token by building an exchange to connect
advertisers, publishers, and service providers (fraud detection, behavioral targeting, yield
management, etc.). See more on this under “Ternio Advertising Exchange”.

ELIMINATING INEFFICIENCIES

Ad account managers can spend 40%+ of their time trying to interpret results/data using
different data sets. Different data sets open themselves up to discrepancies.

Example: one company may claim 10,000 impressions and the next company claims
8,000 impressions - both of which are using the different data sets. Blockchain
streamlines this process by using one stream of data for all in the supply chain. The
entire supply chain still gets to participate, but by decentralizing the trust component
everyone can agree that the data is correct.

TERN:O ?
HELPING THE AD SUPPLY CHAIN

PUBLISHERS

Publishers need access to their earnings immediately. This helps publishers run their
business and create great content at no cost to the end user. Not only are publishers
losing anywhere from 42% to 50% of what advertisers pay for ads due to the ad supply
chain — they must wait as much as 60 to 90 days to collect payment. Beyond this,
publishers have no guarantee that they will even be paid after the stipulated 60-90 day
period.

Ternio allows for:

eco Guaranteed payment for each transaction

coo Instant payments completed on impression delivery

eco Connecting advertisers to publishers via Ternio Advertising Exchange
eco Banking fees not required to collect payment

TERNIO BLOCK CARD™

To simplify payments to publishers, Ternio is currently working to setup a physical
VISA/Mastercard card for quick and easy transaction transfers. Rather than transfer
funds to a publisher's digital wallet, bank account, PayPal, or other mechanism, the Block
Card will allow for almost instantaneous transfers giving the publisher direct access to
funds they earned from the previous day. The Ternio Block Card is currently on the
roadmap for October 2018.

HELPING THE AD SUPPLY CHAIN

ADVERTISERS

Advertisers want transparency to ensure effective use of their ad spend. They want to
ensure their ads are delivered to the right people with limited fraud and robust reporting
and auditing capacity for full transparency. The Ternio blockchain will cut out waste and
increase efficiencies:

Preventing user fraud

coco Eliminating domain fraud

ooo Utilizing smart contracts in Lexicon throughout the ad supply chain to ensure
campaign requirements are met

coo Easily accessible audit reporting

eco Eliminate discrepancies by utilizing decentralized, transparent, and trusted data

OBJECTIVES

There are several core objectives we intend to deliver on. Some will be deployed directly
after the conclusion of the Token Sale while others are on the roadmap.

Facilitate and guarantee the payment transactions daily.

Preventing fraud for advertisers.

Building the first Blockchain to support complete programmatic buying.
Enabling complete transparency of the supply chain.

Building an open exchange for advertisers and publishers to transact directly to
help drive adoption of the Ternio token.

Streamlining payment processing and reporting.

Enabling an advertiser's campaign details [insertion order] to be received and
validated by all parties through Lexicon via smart contract.

HELPING THE AD SUPPLY CHAIN

ADOPTION OF TERNIO

Ternio has already entered into an agreement to be used by one ad technology company
and is currently working to expand rapidly. By already having a contract in place, this will
allow for the ability to immediately demonstrate the power of our blockchain technology to
other publishers, ad tech companies, DSP’s, brands and ad agencies.

Although feasible and desired, integration does take some amount of effort and work.
Publishers will be required to have a slight education on how a new payment/transaction
system works, and advertising platforms will have to hold TERN in order to execute on
impression contracts.

To further accelerate the adoption of Ternio blockchain — we will be offering incentives to
those in the programmatic advertising supply chain.

We accomplish this with the following:

eco Any advertiser or ad tech platform is given incentives in the form of TERN to
contractually commit to integrating Ternio within their platform. This offer is be
limited on a first come first serve basis.

coo Ternio, LLC will assist any ad network in financing during their 60-90 “float”
period from advertisers to help transition them fully to TERN.

coo Development team of Ternio will support ad platforms through every step of
integration.

TECHNOLOGY

TECHNOLOGY BEHIND TERNIO

Ternio is a multifaceted blockchain network utilizing an internal blockchain called Lexicon
based upon Hyperledger Fabric for the immediate smart contracts and transactions of
advertisements, a communication layer for ultra-fast data transfer, and Ternio blockchain
(token) built off of Stellar (XLM).

In terms of transaction limitations, Lexicon at the current moment has no current
pre-defined limit (see Lexicon Blockchain) on the number of transactions, while the
payment settlement side of Ternio has a 100x greater transaction limit than Ethereum.
Unlike traditional blockchains that use PoW models for mining coins, Ternio runs on a
consensus based protocol which works in a similar way to a quorum. A minimum number
of nodes must reach an agreement in order to validate the transaction.

When a user enters a site to begin a session, a request is made to the Ternio network.
This request is first received by the communication layer. The communication layer
communicates information on the user, determines a fraud judgement of the user, verifies
the domain, and then communicates with the advertiser or advertising platform on the
corresponding data of the user. The purpose of the communication layer is to both
transmit data back and forth, as well as pass the advertisers data and/or creative on to
the site. When the advertiser or advertising platform determines they want to purchase an
ad impression for the user, the Lexicon contract will begin and the advertisement is placed
on the website in view of the user to interact with.

The contract continues to stay open until the user either moves to another page or the
advertiser's determined success metric has occurred. Once the contract has completed,
the decentralized ledger is stored for up to 24 hours until the time of transaction
processing. Each day the contracts are collected, and counted; Ternio transaction
contracts are then created, and payment is settled for each of the publishers. (see
Lexicon Blockchain for more information)

THE OPPORTUNITY

LEXICON BLOCKCHAIN

Lexicon is a permissioned based blockchain infrastructure utilized as a ledger system for
record keeping of the contracts between publishers, advertisers and the rest of the supply
chain. Built of off Hyperledger Fabric which was originally created by IBM and Digital
Asset, it provides a modular architecture with a delineation of roles between the nodes in
the infrastructure, execution of Smart Contracts, and configurable consensus and
membership services.[8]

TECHNOLOGY

LEXICON BLOCKCHAIN (CONTINUED..)

The Lexicon Blockchain is built with the intention of full transparency in mind that works
off a series of manually verified partner nodes. These Ternio nodes sign, verify, and hold
contracts for a span of 24 hours. After this - the contract information is collected for
transaction settlement processing. Ternio transaction contracts are then created, and
payment is settled for the publisher and the rest of the ad supply chain. Since this is a
24-hour internal ledger, only direct participants in the ad supply chain have access to their
associated records. All transactions are encrypted using SHA3, only stakeholders in the
transaction can decrypt their records. This enables privacy from onlookers from the
outside, while keeping transparency between the publisher, advertising platforms, and
advertisers (supply chain).

All Lexicon Blockchain records within each node are destroyed after this 24 hour period.
However, any partner that is running a node may backup these records for their own use
and verification or view Ternio’s historical ledger which is available to all publishers,
advertising networks, and advertisers directly using Ternio. In other words, while each
node has every right to store historical data, no node is responsible for validation of the
daily contracts outside of the timeframe of 24 hours.

The availability of the Lexicon Blockchain node was created to ensure security and trust
within the Lexicon contract system. Any publisher, advertising platform, or advertiser
utilizing the Ternio blockchain can request to become a verified node partner and to run
their own node. This verification process includes but is not limited to company credential
verification, company age, and market reputation among others. Due to the way that
Lexicon was created with pre-verification of node partners, the transaction limitations are
set extraordinarily high. At the current moment, HyperLedger Fabric has a hypothetical
limitation of 100,000 transactions per second (tps) based upon a number of factors such
as server resources, block size, number of endorsers, and proximity; comparatively -
running on a geo-distributed setting allows for up to 10,000 tps.[6][7]

TERN:O te
TECHNOLOGY

COMMUNICATION LAYER

The communication layer allows for ultra-fast multidirectional communication between
Ternio, the publisher, advertiser, and fraud detection mechanism. This includes but is not
limited to any ad technologies that are required to display advertisements, user tracking
mechanisms, user information, and creatives. The communication layer is the first access
point onto the Ternio network and facilitates almost all the interaction between the
website, the advertiser, and the contract.

ADVERTISING FRAUD

Fraud is a significant problem within the digital advertising industry with an estimated $16
billion in fraud in 2017 and a projected $19 billion in 2018.[10] Blockchain technology
holds with it the potential to limit fraud significantly through Al, certificates, and the
transparency of ledgers. The Ternio blockchain technology is focused on addressing the
top two forms of ad fraud: domain spoofing, and bot/fraud/invalid user traffic. As
technology and ad spend increase, complex fraud is becoming more mainstream.

Ad fraud is generally considered user-based, such actions as bot traffic, artificially
clicking on advertisements, and purchasing low-quality traffic. However, another major
source of ad fraud is domain fraud (domain spoofing) in which an unapproved website
displays ads that were intended for entirely different and legitimate websites. Upon each
page session, Ternio runs a check verifying that the user is non-fraudulent and the domain
and URL being sent over is non-spoofed and is the same URL that ads will be placed on.
Upon a successful completion of this check, the communication layer will continue its
process and open a dialogue with the advertiser or advertising platform. If at any time
either the user verification or the domain verification are returned with a negative result, all
Ternio processes are halted. In this case, no advertisements are displayed, and no
contract is made.

TERN:O uy
TECHNOLOGY

ADVERTISING FRAUD (CONTINUED..)

Ternio combats domain fraud through a series of checks before a contract begins for each
and every potential contract. If there are 1,000 contracts to perform per minute on a
single domain, Ternio will perform 1,000 domain verifications. This provides an additional
layer of fraud prevention and security for the advertiser.

Domain verification functions similar to a lock on the door of your home, by checking the
stored objects within a ledger (door) with what is returned by the publisher's website (key);
this confirms an authenticated match or pairing and creates a digital signature verifying
the domain accuracy. By utilizing the Lexicon blockchain, Ternio can ensure that the
stored objects are secured and unchanged (immutable objects) over time.

While most of our anti-fraud detection mechanisms cannot be disclosed due to security
reasons, the combination of transparency, instant reporting, availability of auditing, and
proprietary methods help to identify fraud and invalid traffic.

Development of the user verification aspect of Ternio’s complete ad fraud detection
mechanism is currently ongoing as set in the roadmap. While we are in the final steps of
finalizing patentable versions of our user verification methods, Ternio will run 3 different
and widely adopted fraud verification platforms simultaneously.

CROSS-CHAIN COMMUNICATION

Ternio has built-in functionality to be able to communicate with other blockchain
implementations within 3rd-party applications or decentralized markets. To ensure a
smooth rollout of the Ternio blockchain technology, specific parts of the Ternio system
will go live as described in the road map. Cross-chain communication is projected to go
live in August 2018.

TERN:O 18
TECHNOLOGY

TERNIO ADVERTISING EXCHANGE

As the digital advertising industry has grown, advertisers are becoming further and further
removed from publishers. Between DSP’s, ad networks, ad-tech providers, ad operations
providers, tracking systems, analytics systems, fraud detection, and a host of others, the
publisher's share of ad spend has decreased significantly. The advertiser is either having
to pay more for advertisements in order to reach the publisher or the publisher must
accept getting less.

The Ternio Advertising Exchange outlined in the roadmap will help highlight and ultimately
eliminate low value participants in the digital advertising supply chain. As stated on the
Ternio Roadmap, the Ternio Advertising Exchange is projected to launch Q1 of 2019
allowing publishers and advertisers to connect directly in a safe and transparent
environment.

The publisher receives ad placement from advertisers with higher CPM’s, guaranteed
payment and transparent decentralized records; advertisers receive user and domain
verified demand (traffic), as well as a savings on the cost of displaying the ads.

Advertisers can purchase Ternio tokens (TERN) in an automated fashion through the
Ternio Advertising Exchange and transact in real-time with publishers and all other
elements of the ad supply chain.

The need for inefficient manual Insertion Orders (IO) or invoices throughout the supply
chain is eliminated. Through blockchain contracts, the Insertion Orders (IO) are digitally
signed on each impression and invoice-less payment settlement transactions are
completed every 24 hours.

TERN:O 19
TECHNOLOGY

TERNIO TOKENS

Tokens are called “Ternio” in both the singular and plural form with an exchange
abbreviation of TERN. Publishers and all other companies in the ad supply chain receive
tokens through the transaction of selling their traffic to advertisers in exchange for a value
of TERN. Those recipients are free to do as they please with TERN. They may cash them
out in an exchange for tangible currency, trade them with others for services, or hold on to
them within their own wallet. Publishers aren’t the only ones that have a use for tokens.
Advertisers have the ability to purchase and hold tokens as well, allowing them to transact
with publishers directly through the Ternio Advertising Exchange or any other platform that
utilizes TERN for transactions.

Ternio platform has a B2B business model in which the general consumer is not involved
in the general utility of TERN. Although TERN cannot be mined or utilized as a utility by
the general consumer, they are still able to purchase, hold, trade, or sell TERN through an
exchange.

TERNIO TOKEN EXCHANGE

There are many centralized and decentralized token exchanges currently available on the
market today. However, it can be difficult at times for people without extensive
knowledge of blockchain to engage in the buying and selling of their tokens. While
exchange markets have their rightful place, the general person should be able to buy and
sell Ternio tokens with the same ease as they would be purchasing anything else online.
By creating a simplified exchange geared towards those without extensive market
knowledge, the trade of TERN will increase dramatically, allowing for faster growth of
Ternio within the advertising industry. The token exchange will exclusively revolve around
TERN and XLM tokens with payment processing through wire transfer, credit card, or
trade of digital currency.

The initial version of the token exchange will allow for verified advertisers and publishers
to be able to purchase and sell TERN. Version 2.0 will expand upon this to allow for the
general public.

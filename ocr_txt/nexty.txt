none of them have completed so far.
With foresee as a mean of future payment, Nexty shall
support businesses of all sizes and scopes to overcome
barriers of trading, to make the future possible, Nexty is having

1. Businesses & individuals have not found a _ really

Whitepaper

convenient payment method

It is easy to see that although information technology is
booming, the banking system is cumbersome, and it is
difficult to put the change into practice quickly. The difficulty is
faced especially with reference to international payment. In
addition to that, the payment time is very long - from | to 3
days for the form of transfer. Usage of payment tools such as
credit card and online payment system face a big barrier in
the form of transaction fees and the security of those
systems. Cryptocurrency has been drawing a lot of attention
recently, although it is ‘evaluated’ to be the solution of the
above backlog but has not really solved these problems.

Some Cryptocurrencies has reduced international settlement

time to near-instantaneous threshold, but soon after, it
ei NextyCoin
Whitepaper

became slow when the number of users increased drastically.
In addition, payment fees are relatively high, even some types
have higher costs using old payment methods such as online

credit card, online payment system etc.

2. Nexty has a vision:
- Prospective transactions

Leica is an intern. She is new in the city, carrying a small
luggage and her phone. She has been in contact with her
landlord Jimmy to discuss sub-renting his studio apartment.
After receiving the apartments location and pictures, she
transferred the deposit to Jimmy’s Nexty account. On hand-
over day, they set up items of the existing digital contract

established by Nexty’s partners. To accept the contract and

confirm the payment on a period of six months, Nexty just
ei NextyCoin

needs to scan the QR code on Jimmy's phone. After that all

Whitepaper

other steps will be performed automatically. All daily payment
activities of Leica are that simple. From food to fashion, or
other expenses can be performed through Nexty’s account by
easily scanning the QR code.

Jimmy has his own business, importing large amount of lamb
from other countries to sell in domestic market. Every time
performing an international transfer to a business partner
abroad, it requires a lot of time with high transaction fees.
However, with the helo of Nexty’s technology, Jimmy does it
quickly by the guarantee of partners belonging to the
ecosystem of Nexty in terms of creating and following LC. The
Contracts articles are intelligently formatted under the

electronic form.

ei NextyCoin

This can be well reflected by this new business transaction

Whitepaper

stream. Jimmy recently signed a contract with Lambrovider, a
lamb-exporter in New Zealand. The disbursement is
guaranteed, and payments are fully made at each point the
action is compliant with the contract.

Lambrovider has a bunch of orders this year. With its limited
cash available on account, they are not able to gather
enough lamb meat to export. They have worked with ecoBank,
one of the partners in the Ecosystem of Nexty. Since ecoBank
could verify that the contract with Jimmy is reliable and they
are able to reimburse the payment, the loan was quickly
approved. Everything needed was the information of digital
contract between Lambrovider and Jimmy.

For online and traditional payment transactions, ecoBank and

Nexty have collaborated and issued MasterCard, which allows
ei NextyCoin

customers to pay traditional credit card merchant, by swiping

Whitepaper

cards, or through apps such as Apple Pay, Google Tez, and
Samsung Pay.
So, why can Nexty work together with partners to build a
convenient payment for the future?
Shortly after the ICO succeeded, Nexty would build a very
active service network through its connection to Nexty's
system. Among them, there are numerous of start-up
businesses using Nexty’s own token system to call for capital
because they can take advantage of the existing system with
the superior features that Nexty has.

3. The rise of Fintech & what Nexty will do:

Whitepaper

3/1 The rise of Fintech
Fintech is a term being mentioned repeatedly in the usage of
information technology and how it is used in the financial
sector. As Forbes magazine mentioned in their recent article,
there is a rise of Fintech for three reasons:
- There is a strategic contradiction between technology
and finance
- Market realities encourage short-term thinking
- Incumbents in the market are powerful and resistant to
change
However, that resurgence requires a currency platform with
low transaction time and low transfer costs. This can be met

with the Duo Cryptocurrency Confirmation System invented

by Nexty. With the Duo Cryptocurrency Confirmation System
ei NextyCoin

all transactions will be transferred in near-instant (only

Whitepaper

delayed due to Internet connection) at no cost.

3.2 Dual Cryptocurrency Confirmation System (DCCS):

Duo Cryptocurrency Confirmation System includes two types
of Cryptocurrency operating in parallel. The former called NTY,
is the main cryptocurrency for using in daily transactions. The
latter called NTF, is for transaction confirmation system.
Transaction confirmation system is built on a peer-to-peer
network with specific criteria to meet operational
requirements. The breakthrough here is that instead of
charging per transaction, those who are the holders of the
second type of cryptocurrency will be rewarded with a small
amount of cryptocurrency at the minor rate at the end of

sealing round which is about 30-minute to 360-minute long.

This will allow the transaction fees to be zero while still
ei NextyCoin

guaranteeing the benefits to the persons who contribute to

Whitepaper

transaction confirmation system.

This bonus is generated by the POF algorithm (described
below)

The method of operation is as follows:

Appendix:

NTY: Code name of Nexty Coin

PNTY: Package equivalent to 10,000 NTY

NTF: Nexty Foundation Coin

DCCS: Dual Cryptocurrency Confirmation System

POF: Proof of Foundation - the new consensus algorithm
was invented for transaction confirmation system.

The proportion of generated amounts is based on the PoF

algorithm to pay for the machinery and personnel operating

the transaction confirmation system, helping to ensure that
ei NextyCoin

the two features of the cryptocurrency are superior for

Whitepaper

properly operating.
However, NTF holders do not have the right to vote for NTY
currency decisions in the future, such as block size upgrades,
mining speeds, transaction confirmation. The rights will
belong to NTY holders with fair votes.

- The Appearance of NTF — Nexty Foundation:
For only the first 10 billion of NTY joining Smart Staking
program within 3 months: 10,000 NTY in the wallet will have
one NTF generated automatically.
At the end of 3-month Smart Staking, when NTY's total current
supply is up to 100 billion, the NTF (which had automatically
calculated before) will be available in the market. Since only
the first 10 billion NTY can generate NTF, the amount of NTF is

limited to 10 million.

ei NextyCoin

Only NTF holders will be given the right to build mining and

Whitepaper

confirmation machine for NTY. There will be a total of 40 billion
NTY generated by POW, and after that time, the machine
system will only be responsible for transaction confirmation.
At present, there are many investors mining with great power
on the former coin systems such as BTC, ETH, ... but more and
more difficult to mine and cause the value of the machine fell.
Thus, NTF will helo to make use of these miners through
leasing or acquisition and that is fully within reach.

What will be another source of income for NTF holders
besides mining? We have a new concept, PoF (Proof of
Foundation). Every month, only holders with NTF will receive
NTY by that algorithm, divided by the percentage of them
their amount of NTF over 10 million NTF. The NTY generated by

the POF algorithm is calculated as follows:

ei NextyCoin

Whitepaper
Less than 12 months 0.5%/month
12 - 23 0.4%/month
24 - 35 0.3%/ month
36 - 47 0.2%/month
48 months onwards 0.1%/ month

Do not worry about the decrease in NTY rates for two reasons
a. Total NTY increases (by PoF)
b. NTY values increase due to its popularity, community

acceptance and ecosystem expansion

NTY in next 5 years then going to be stable. This target will be
achieved thanks to algorithm of Price Stabilization System.
This system is controlled by a group of expert economists at

be an important stage in attracting capital to grow. Funds will
be used primarily for following purposes:

- Build the initial infrastructure of both personnel and
machinery to operate the system properly so that it can
initially serve large numbers of users.

- Developing an ecosystem for Nexty by extending its
connectivity to all businesses with a large client base, to
convince Nexty to integrate the system.

increasing. NTF coin will be very rare, because the
quantity is not much, there are many advantages in the
future. In addition, only NTF holders are allowed to equip
mining and transaction confirmation machines

- NTF holders enjoy a high monthly income through the
operation of transaction confirmation systems

- Buy NTY at a much lower price than when we started
listing on exchanges

Smart staking program

Smart staking program, which is part of Price Stabilization
System, is a monetary policy to regulating demand and
supply. By providing flexible bonus, this program can inspire
NTY holders to sell, buy or hold NTY to adapt to the balance of

demand and supply. There are three types of staking

programs:
& NextyCoin

7-day staking

Whitepaper

- 30-day staking

- 90-day staking

360-day staking

These programs target to short-term, middle-term and long-

their assets periodically if they keep a minimum amount in
their staking wallet. Within 7 days after the end of each
staking period, Nexty's system will add to the owner's wallet.

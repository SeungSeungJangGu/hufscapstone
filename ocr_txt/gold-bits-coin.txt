Gold Bits Coin:

Empowering and stabilizing the future economy.

Whatis Gold Bits Coin?

The world today feels like it's becoming more disjointed and uncertain than ever.
Financial shocks and geopolitical crises become ever more frequent, while
simultaneously new technology such as the blockchain allows us to peer into amore
prosperous and transparent future. With all these.changes at play we feel that
people, organizations and governments deserve a currency that hedges against this
uncertainty. A currency that will have a reliable value in times of crisis and instability.

This is our Vision behind creating Gold Bits Coin. It'is one that is shared by an
increasing number of economists and financial experts who see the global benefits
Of a major currency.

GBC has many utility features suchas paying for goods and services on online
shopping platforms and from merchants. GBC believessthat the acceptance of
crypto would only happen if.it.is possible to use crypto in the real world on a daily
basis to purchase goods or services that you require. GBC wants to be the first step
in the right direction forthe crypto world. GBC wants to be the Modern Day Gold of
this industry.

One of the most exciting aspects of Gold Bits Coin is its potential usability as legal
tender. We believe that cryptocurrencies and governments can not only co-exist
together but can serve to empower and make the other better and more efficient.
The implications of this are profound: the implementation of GBC as a recognised
national currency would provide governments with increased international capital
inflows and help eliminate the losses incurred by counterfeit currency.’

* Governmental Advantages

As aforementioned, the structure and stability of Gold Bits Coin lends itself towards
potential adoption as legal tender for governments. Government adoption of digital
currencies is something that is becoming more likely as the technology matures and
reaches the mainstream’. From a governmental perspective this prospect has two
clear advantages:

2. See Kenneth Rogoff (http://www.nber.org/chapters/c13431.pdf)

+ Increased inflow of international capital. Digital currencies allow for
transaction costs to be reduced, particularly if the currency is accepted in a wide
range of places outside of a country's territory. In tourist destinations the ease of
using digital currencies is likely to encourage tourists to spend more on average.
This has been the experience in Thailand, where bitcoin payments by tourists have
become increasingly popular in response to concern about credit card fraud in the
country. The increased acceptance of digital currencies will help boost the
economy of the country in question, helping create jobs and increase the overall
standard of living.

* Reduction of currency counterfeiting. One of the major problems with physical
currency is that it opensiup the possibility of counterfeiting. By adopting a digital
currency, a government could near eliminate this problem and protect the integrity
of its currency’.

With these advantages in mind itis important to highlight thegeasons why Gold Bits
Coin is better suited for governments than other digital currencies. These
advantages can be summarised as followed:

* Gold Bits Coin is open to working with governments on the control of the
currency. Many cryptocurrencies strongly oppose any government regulation or
potential control over them. This has led to concern that unregulated digital
currencies might decrease state control over tax revenues’. GBC however believes
that digital currencies and government need not be adversaries. Instead, these two
parties have shared interests and cam work.together. For a cryptocurrency,
government backing will allow for mainstream adoption and approval of the
currency.

* Gold Bits Coin already has an established value and proven demand. As of
April 2018, GBC has thousands of token holders’and.a.price of $0.50 USD. This is
proof that consumers see value in the token. This makes it easier for a government
to adopt and work alongsidethan the creation of a new digital currency that is highly
likely to come with challenges, particularly in the initial release. A poorly planned
release of a new digital currency may affect public perception and trust in the coin,
potentially creating lasting damage to its potential to be adopted by the
mainstream. This would not be the case with the adoption of Gold Bits Coin.

GBC's formula for their tokens success is to change the concept of spending,

instead of spending = loss we want to change it to spending = profit

Mr.’A’ has $10.in credit card Mr.'A’ has $10 in GBC price rose to
buys a Chocolate for $2. $12 while sitting. Mr.'A’ buys the
Amount left $8 chocolate for $2. Amount left $10.

GBC Platform
Wallet:6.0
Investments

Inside the GBC platform and wallet, there will be a section for projects.
Projects that fit the criteria set out are able to be voted for. This will
enable the sustainability of GBC and ensure the coin is a leader in the

future.

GBC will be developing a protocol to shift the current ERC-20 token network to a hybrid/native
version of the token. Ultimately, the GBC community will have the final decision about this
potential shift. The advantage of this shift is that the cost of transactions on the GBC blockchain
would be significantly reduced. Moving forward, GBC expects that the token will be accepted by
merchants and e-commerce stores allowing token holderstouse this on a daily basis.

Our Vision is that the Gold Bits Coin community is active and regularly participates in decisions.
Accordingly, members will be classified into tiers according to their activity and work completed by
them. This will help generate different levels of returns and reward members who are more active
and contribute more. The'GBC Foundation will release a detailed list of all the different roles in the
network and the responsibilities and requirements for each. These responsibilities will be unique
to the tier status of members as will be explained below in the vesting section.

Copper:

1. User agrees to put 80% of their GBC tokens in lock up for 3 months.

2. User receives a 10% upweight in voting for projects.

3. User receives copper status perks, things like 5%-discount at partner commerce sites.
4. User receives access to VIP events with Copper perks.

5. User votes on a proposal at least once every 3\months that they stay on Copper status.

6. User will receive gifts from the foundation at the\copper tier.

GBC had approached Crypto Launch pad for auditing and approval of our token structure and our

token economics. Crypto Launch pad is aprestigious and recognized crypto auditing firm. Crypto

Launch pad had given us approval after carefully reviewing our project. This ensures our token
holders maximum trust and security

1. User has completed Copper status meeting all the conditions for the 3 months.

2. User agrees to put 80% of their GBC tokens in lock up for 1 year (the 3 months of the prior
Copper level are counted in this).

3. User receives a 50% upweight in voting for projects.
4. User receives Silver status perks, things like 10% discount at partner commerce sites.
5. User receives access to VIP events with Silver perks.
6. User votes on a proposal at least twice every 3 months.that they stay on Silver status.

7. User will receive gifts from the foundation-at the Silver tier.

1. User has completed Silver status, meeting all the conditions forthe 1 year.

2.User agrees to put 80% of their GBC tokens in lock up for 3 years(1 year of  Silver/Copper
already counts.).

3.User receives a 100% up weight in voting for projects.
4.User receives VIP Gold status perks, things like 20% discount at partner commerce sites.
5. User receives access'to VIP Gold only events as well as VIP events with Gold perks.

6. User votes on a proposal at least 3 times every 3 months that they stay on Gold status.

7. User will receive gifts from the foundation at the-Gold tier.

As discussed in the vesting section, members in the network will receive discounts to merchants
and e-commerce stores if they pay via \GBC. The incentive structure for merchants is

straightforward as they do not pay the percentage costs they would typically pay to payment

providers such as Visa or Mastercard. As a result, they can pass their discount onto customers
paying via GBC. Additionally, if many people pay via GBC and merchants adopt and store GBC, this
could result in the value of the coin increasing, rather than the value of the stored coin
depreciating, which is a benefit for merchants over time and will likely create a positive cycle of

increased value.

The GBC Foundation, as an incentive to refer and bring more people into the GBC Community,
will be creating a Reward System for GBC Users to promote the uptake of the GBC Token and
increase overall liquidity.

The way it would work is when a GBC User refers a person to come and buy GBC, as token of
our gratitude we would be rewarding that GBC user with rewards such as GBC tokens, Access
to GBC VIP Events, Discount Coupons on Partnering E-commerce Platforms, Gifts and More.

One Of the utmost priorities of GBC is security. In order to ensure the platform is secure, GBC’s
infrastructure and smart contract code have been reviewed by some of the top security
auditors and bug bounty hunters in the, world: During the process, extensive penetration
testing was performed which revealed a\number of critical vulnerabilities in the GBC web
application API as well as the Smart, contract. The vulnerabilities included open API calls that
allowed an attacker to access user accounts and reveal their internal data. The vulnerabilities in
the smart contract included Integer overflows-which allowed wallet balance manipulation.
These tests proved fruitful and the fixing these errors allowed us to build greater confidence in
our infrastructure and security. GBC at this point is a highly secure platform with the highest
level of security testing having been completed. GBC's infrastructure is compliant of the AIC
triad which defines the basis of security. Overall, we have strict procedures and guidelines to
which we have built GBC upon.

A Gold Bits Coin is a utility token by definition used to clear payments just like any digital asset

currency. There are no restrictions to sell GBC to residents of any country, unless the law of the
country prohibits citizens of that country to buy digital assets of any kind. By purchasing Gold
Bits Coin, you agree that you are in compliance with your local laws on purchasing non-
sovereign currency and digital assets. You are also liable for ensuring you abide by your local
tax and compliance obligations on the gains and uses of GBC.

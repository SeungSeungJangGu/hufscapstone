GNY.IO’s DECENTRALIZED DISTRIBUTED MACHINE LEARNING BLOCKCHAIN

One benefit of blockchain’s decentralized technology is its application beyond cryptocurrencies. We are applying
the techology to machine learning — to enable a smarter “thinking” blockchain process. Most machine learning
models that have been used have an underlying assumption that some global knowledge is required by its
algorithms to function (see fig 1). These are centralized distributed, where the entire data set is loaded into a
cloud of distributed nodes so that the two main functions of machine learning are performed in one large library
of functions ETL/Exploration and Model Training/Parameter Tuning. Spark, Watson, Azure all use this platform
based approach and we are also biased towards methods that have been known to work.

gny.io’s DistributedDeep Learning breaks this pattern of one large platform library by creating two of the smallest
configurable self-learning unsupervised neural net nodes — ETL node and ML node — and distributing these
nodes into each block of the block chain to have them teach themselves the solution to each problem. The one
conceptual problem though of machine learning is that error detection requires global knowledge that gets back-
propagated to its constituents. This requirement though is fixed in gny.io’s DistributedDeep Learning systems.
Therefore we prefer the term ‘localized models’ and not ‘model free models’, even though both mean a measure
of lack of intelligence of constituent parts. In general though, this is similar to the concept of ‘parsimony’, in that
we seek the simplest of mechanisms that give rise to emergent properties of prediction. Gny.io is not a crushed
up small machine learning library; it is one node of a huge distributed brain.

Gny.io has configurable ETL microservices and configurable machine learning microservices that can read the
entire chain of data or it can read the current block data. Gny.io’s microservices uses deep learning which is a
class of machine learning algorithms in the form of a neural network that uses a cascade of layers (tiers) of
processing units to extract features from data and make predictive guesses about new data. The smallest ML
node system varies the weights and biases to see if a better outcome is obtained using a neural network (see
Fig 2).

At the heart of Gny.io is the special backpropagation algorithm. Backpropagation of errors and gradient descent
are some of optimization methods used to calculate the error contribution of each blockchain node after a batch
of data is processed. Gny.io uses a variation of structured streaming Al and parquet data format - this sets the
weights in the neuron. This means that the neurons change their connection and their weights to lesson the
error. Gny.io will determine the normal rules of the system by itself with unsupervised learning. Adjusted weights
is what is configurable.

Backpropagation is an expression for the partial derivative 0C/dw of the cost function C with respect to any
weight w (or bias b) in the network. The expression tells us how quickly the cost changes when we change the
weights and biases. And so backpropagation isn't just a fast algorithm for learning. It actually gives us detailed
insights into how changing the weights and biases, changes the overall behavior of the network.

Let W(I)jk be the weight we are trying to find to Ath neuron in the (/-1)th layer to the jth neuron in the /th layer.
So, for example, the diagram below shows the weight on a connection from the fourth neuron in the second
layer to the second neuron in the third layer of a network:

wy, is the weight from the k“® neuron
in the (J — 1)"* layer to the j*® neuron
in the [‘* layer

Let bij for the bias of the jth neuron in the /th layer. And we use aij for the activation of the jth neuron in the /th
layer. The following diagram shows examples of these notations in use:

layer 1 layer 2 layer 3

The goal of backpropagation is to compute the partial derivatives dC/dw and dC/db of the cost function C with
respect to any weight w or bias b in the network. The cost function is expressed as:

where: n is the total number of training examples; the sum is over individual training examples, x; y=y(x) is the
corresponding desired output; L denotes the number of layers in the network; and aL=aL(x) is the vector of
activations output from the network when x is input.

What Gny.io does is compute the partial derivatives dCx/dw and dCx/db for a single training example of in last
blockchain connection. This allows us to use the equations to design activation functions which have particular
desired learning properties.

Each block in the blockchain contains one neuron and the blockchain is the neural net - each smart contract is
an account that has its own code - so with the neural nets.

Unlike Watson, Azure or Spark there is no controlling machine learning manager cluster and no data lake. The
neural nets are self organizing and self correcting. Gny.io takes the data partition idea of parquet to its logical
conclusion and performs massive parallel pattern learning that sets the weights of the neuron.

Gny.io’s gradient descent optimization is Deep Learning. Deep learning is an advanced form of Artificial
Intelligence and a powerful set of techniques for learning in neural networks. Neural networks and deep learning
currently provide the best solutions to many problems in image recognition, speech recognition, and natural
language processing,

Gny.io is a fusion of Deep Learning technology on to a blockchain. The blockchain, being a distributed
transparent consensus based peer-to-peer network that has been shown to be extremely resilient to adversarial
attacks. The blockchain itself creates the neural net. Gny.io is the first to apply this technique in blockchain.

Gny.io uses a Probabilistic Graph Model (PGM) approach to DL. In the PGM approach, the neural nodes
construct a probabilistic graph that defines the relationship’s different variables. The approach uses Monte-Carlo
sampling to construct Bayesian consistent distributions for the variables. We then use Deep Learning to learn
from this synthesized data.

Gny io has:

Embeddedness - The neural nets do not exist in isolation and are embedded in a much larger blockchain
ecosystem.

Redundancy - Duplication of components may be inefficient however it provides the mechanism to handle the
unexpected. In addition, functional redundancy offers a way to repurpose components to reduce costs.

Heterogeneity - Different predictive machines make it possible to react to a more diverse range of change as
well as avoid correlated behavior that can lead to total system failure. Diversity is required for evolutionary
learning and adaptation.

Modularity - Decoupling of components act like firewalls between components and help mitigate against total
collapse. Individual component damage can be tolerated while the integrity of other components are preserved.
In general, a distributed loosely coupled system has higher survivability that a centralized tightly coupled system.

Adaptation - A system needs to be sufficiently flexible and agile to adjust to changes in the environment.
Adaptive approaches that involve simulation, selection, and amplification of successful strategies are important.
Self-learning is requirement to achieve adaptability.

We believe the future of blockchain is a world that different blockchains can be connected easily. We will
develop the cross chain protocol, which will connect GNY core to many other mainstream blockchains. Every
DApp developed based on GNY can import other tokens like BTC, ETH to their DApp.

GNY.IO will adapt the DPoS + BFT consensus algorithm, which will have 21 super nodes who maintain the
network. There are many other lightweight nodes who will handle transactions to the network.

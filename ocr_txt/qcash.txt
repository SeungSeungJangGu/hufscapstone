1. Background

Bitcoin, Ethereum and other popular digital currencies want to become a currency
recognized by the mainstream market, must have higher profit, and this high-yield
behind is greater volatility, while the value of money has a value scale that excludes this
High volatility. Therefore, the stable currency represented by USDT was on the stage.
Specifically, these digital currencies are either exchanged at a fixed rate for a particular
asset, or the currency is stabilized by an algorithm that regulates the money supply and
is therefore called a stable currency.

There are two demand for stable currency. One is safe-haven demand. When the digital
currency falls, the requirement for stable currency is very strong. Investors need to
convert the digital currency they hold into stable currency to reduce losses. The second
is, Since the development of digital currency, it has to enter the circulation field, and the
circulation field needs a currency with relatively stable value.

At present, the stable currencies in the current market can be mainly divided into three
types:

e Fiat currency credit guarantee
e Digital asset collateral guarantee
e Unsecured algorithm release

No matter by what means, a stable currency should try to solve exchange rate stability,
free flow problem, and give money over, so that all users have reached their
Aconsensus of values. The unsecured algorithm issuance is difficult to guarantee the
stability of the exchange rate because it lacks the underlying trust foundation. The legal
currency credit guarantee and the digital asset mortgage guarantee are two more
mainstream methods. Aside from the problem that the legal currency credit guarantee
itself is too centralized, it also has certain drawbacks as a currency attribute.

The stable currency market is fundamentally different from other cryptocurrency
markets (such as Ethereum, EOS, etc.). The stable currency market is the money
market, while other cryptocurrencies are closer to the stock market. The money market
is fundamentally different from the stock market. The stock market is to provide risk
sharing, while the currency is the market to provide liquidity. The stable currency such
as TUSD and GUSD lies in the fact that once the market is deflated, due to its strong
supervision, it requires cumbersome steps such as KYC, which leads to the inability to
issue more currencies in a short time to meet market demand, resulting in large price
fluctuations. TUSD is on the line, and the increase of 30% in half a day can be seen.
Digital asset mortgage guarantee is a possible breakthrough point, presenting a
more rational equilibrium paradigm . This requires a fundamental difference
between the USDT (above the regulatory and auditing levels) and efficient
liquidity.

2.QuickCash stable currency system

QuickCash is one of the first projects and institutions in the world to offer stable
currency solutions. With the continuous development of blockchain technology, we have
been exploring and optimizing our stable currency solutions to provide better use of
stable coins for the market with the aim of decentralization, free circulation, exchange
rate stability and safety compliance. Create a frictionless, faster global trading network.

QucikCash 's design philosophy is based on smart contracts that provide liquidity at a
low cost (anyone can gain liquidity through over-collateralized digital assets). The
issuance model of asset collateral on the chain has stimulated people to spontaneously
collateralize funds, enrich the source of liquidity, and eliminate the need for centralized
gateways and hosting, eliminating the need for central institutions to question (since the
mortgage process is on the chain, provided Sufficient transparency) .

2.1 QuickCash stable coins

At present, the market is mainly a stable currency anchoring the US dollar, which is
actually not friendly to countries whose fiat currency is not US dollar . Based on the
QuickCash stable currency system, we offer different products and solutions for users in
different regions of the world to reduce exchange friction.

QuickCash's stable currency is QuickCash CNY, referred to as QC. The 1 QC’s value is
$0.15 (1CNY) and is issued through digital currency overcollateralized credit
guarantees.

QC is divided into two versions, Qtum and ETH. Qtum is released earlier, with larger
circulation and transaction volume. ETH is a new system, and its smart contracts issued
by pledge are more excellent. Together with the integrity and acceptance of the
Ethereum ecosystem, the scope of use of QC is further expanded.

2.2 QuickCash Roadmap

2.2.1 Phase |: Application stage

This phase is a transitional mechanism based on product and market demand . In the
past, our first QC stable currency was released on Qtum and tested for its stable and
safe features in long-term market circulation.
Now, we are releasing a stable currency in ERC-20 mode through smart contracts on
Ethereum . And the choice of Ethernet Square because of its diverse ecology, the high
demand for a stable currency and ERC-20 token is satisfied that most mining center
and to the center of the exchange. QuickCash supports Ether Assets to issue stable
currencies for mortgages. Supported Ether assets include ETH and our selection of
stable currencies such as TUSD, GUSD, USDC, PAX, etc.

The QucikCash system can be quickly extended to any blockchain platform that can
implement smart contracts. Soon we will also release the corresponding version
of QuickCash stable currency on EOS and TRX .

2.2.2 Phase Il : Governance and upgrade

In the coming year, we will launch our public blockchain QuickCash , cross-chain
integration, support multi-chain digital asset mortgage to obtain stable currencies in
different 1 to many different chains. The evolution from Phase | to Phase II is smooth.

Everyone can easily mortgage BTC, ETH and ERC20 stable currencies, EOS and other
popular mainstream digital assets to obtain QuickCash stable currency in different main
chain versions.

At the same time, we will continue to integrate with the global financial market to
diversify the mortgage assets and include other digital assets such as gold certificates
and stocks in the QC mortgage assets basket.

The greater significance QucikCash Chain is that QuickCash 's governance will be fully
transferred to community autonomy, with a more transparent, fairer and
broader QuickCashstable currency.

3.QC

QC is our decentralized stable currency product based on Ethereum Smart Contract.
With the extensive market acceptance of Ethereum and rich stable currency ecology, it
will become our key product to be built and launched at this stage. In this section, we
will set forth in detail the process of QNCY issue of price stabilization mechanisms and
risk control.

3.1 Collateralized Debt Positions (CDP )
Anyone can do a leveraged mortgage assets generated
QC on QuickCash platform, through QuickCash Collateralized Debt Positions( CDP ).

The CDP holds the mortgage assets stored by the user and allows the user to generate
QC, but generating QC means generating a debt. The debt will lock the mortgage
assets in the CDP until the user repays the QC before returning the mortgage
assets. Effective CDP are all over-collateralization, which means the value of the
collateral is higher than the value of debt.

The entire CDP process can be represented by the following figure:

</>

Smart contract

User CDP QuickCash

Liquidator Liquidation platform Profit < 0 orders
Figure 1: CDP business diagram
QC pledged debt warehouse use process:
Step 1: Create a CDP and store the collateral

The user first sends a transaction to QuickCash create CDP, and then sends another
transaction details and collateral type and quantity of assets used to generate QC
stored in the CDP. At this point, CDP has a mortgage.

Step 2: Generate QC from CDP

The CDP holder sends a transaction and details the amount of QC that will be
generated from the CDP, and the CDP will also generate the same amount of debt,
which will lock the collateral until the outstanding debt is paid.

Step 3: Repayment of debt and stabilization costs

When users want to redeem mortgage assets, they need to repay the debt in the CDP
and the stable cost of the debt. Stabe fees can be paid in QC and ETH. When the user
pays the QC and the stable fee to the CDP, the debt in the CDP will be paid off.

Step 4: Take back the mortgaged assets and close the CDP
When debt and stable fee are repaid, CDP holders can send a transaction to the QC
platform and get back all the mortgaged assets.

3.2 CDP clearance clearing

When the mortgaged Equity Asset falls to the liquidation ratio and the mortgaged user
does not add collateral before then, it will enter the short-selling smart contract to
perform the liquidation and liquidation. The pledge after the bankruptcy will enter the
auction, and the clearing commercial QC will quote and participate in the auction.
Finally, the highest bidder will receive the pledge, and the QC paid by the clearer

will pay the stable fee and fill in the liabilities arising from CDP (That is, destroy).

Liquidation ratio = value of pledged assets / (QC value of borrowing + stable fee)

Set different clearing ratios for different Ethereum assets, combined with their volatility
characteristics :

e ETH: 150%
e US dollar stable currency PAX / GUSD / TUSD/USDC: 105%

3.3 Price stabilization mechanism
QC target price
In the QC system, the QC target price has two important functions:

1. The proportion of mortgage debt used to calculate the mortgage debt
2. Determine the value of the mortgaged asset that the QC holder will receive upon
global liquidation.

QC's initial target price is equal to 1 CNY, and will gradually be anchored with CNY.

3.2.1 Target price feedback mechanism

When the market is unstable, the target price change rate feedback mechanism will be
activated. The target price change rate feedback mechanism will allow QC to maintain
the CNY price, but off a fixed percentage of the CNY.

The target price change rate feedback mechanism means that the QC stable monetary
system mobilizes market forces to maintain the stability of the QC market price by
adjusting the target price change rate. The target price change rate determines the
change in the target price and can motivate people to hold QC (when the target rate of
change is positive) or borrow QC (in case the target rate of change is negative). In the
stage where the target price change rate feedback mechanism is not activated, the
target price change rate will be set to 0%, meaning that the target price will not change,
and QC and CNY are hard anchored.
When the target price change rate feedback mechanism is activated, the target price
change rate and the target price itself will dynamically change to balance the demand
and supply of QC to adjust the way users generate and hold QC incentives. This
feedback mechanism moves QC's market price to the target price, mitigating price
volatility in QC and providing liquidity in the event of a demand shock.

Under the target price change rate feedback mechanism, when the market price of QC
is lower than the target price, the target price change rate will increase. This will raise
the target price and make it more expensive to generate QC using CDP. At the same
time, increase the target price rate of change will increase the return on capital QC hold,
leading to increased demand for the purchase QC. Reduced supply and increased
demand will increase the market price of QC and approach its target price.

The same mechanism applies when the market price of QC is higher than the target

price: the target rate of change decreases, resulting in increased demand for QC and
reduced demand for QC, thus causing QC's market price to fall and approaching the

target price.

Such a mechanism is a reverse feedback loop: QC's market price deviates in one
direction of the target price and also produces forces in the opposite direction.

3.4 Risk parameter

The QC CDP has multiple risk parameters. Each CDP category has its own unique risk
parameter settings that determine the risk profile of the CDP type and will be public and
require the participants to focus on it.

Key CDP risk parameters include:

Debt cap : The cap on debt is the maximum amount of debt a single type of CDP can
create. Once the debt created by a certain type of CDP reaches the upper limit, it will
not be able to create a new QC unless the existing CDP is redeemed. The debt ceiling
is used to ensure that the mortgage portfolio is sufficiently diversified.

Liquidation ratio : The liquidation ratio is the ratio of mortgage/debt at the time the
CDP is liquidated. A lower liquidation ratio means that the price of the mortgaged asset
is less volatile, and a higher liquidation ratio means a higher price fluctuation of the
mortgaged asset.

Stable fee : Stable fee are the fees that each CDP will pay. An annualized proportion of
debt generated based on CDP must be paid by the CDP holder. Stable cost to QC
price and payment, we will soon be implemented in other assets to pay

Ethernet, Ethernet assets amount to be paid depends on the market price of the
Ethernet assets of feed.
Penalty ratio : The penalty ratio is the clearing agent's fee when the CDP is
liquidated, and the remaining mortgage assets in the CD P will be returned to the holder
of the CDP before the liquidation .

3.5 Important external participants

In addition to the smart contract infrastructure, the QuickCash platform relies on some
external participants to keep running. The acceptor and external participants will use the
economic incentives of the QuickCash platform to act.

e Underwriter

The acceptor is an independent participant (often automated) that is driven by economic
incentives to contribute to the decentralized system. The acceptor will trade QC around
the target price.When the market price is higher than the target price, the acceptor will
sell QC. Similarly, when the market price is lower than the target price, the acceptance
providers will buy QC. This is done to benefit from the long-term price convergence of
the market target price. In the QC stable currency system, the acceptor also participates
in debt auctions and mortgaged asset auctions at the time of CDP liquidation, ie as a
liquidator.

e Price provider

The QuickCash platform requires real-time price information on the mortgaged assets to
determine when to trigger liquidation. The Q uickCash platform also requires QC's
market price to trigger a target price change rate feedback mechanism when it deviates
from the target price. Mainstream platform for digital currency will be chosen to

be Q uickCash price of feed suppliers to ensure to avoid non-normal price.

e Liquidator

The liquidator is an external participant who participates in the auction at the time of
CDP's liquidation auction. The clearer needs to hold a certain QC to ensure that it can
quickly sell QC to the QuickCash platform for asset repurchase.

4 Potential market

As the preface, has a price stability of monetary encryption is the basic needs of the
vast majority of decentralized applications, which makes it a potential market of at least
QuickCash larger than the entire block chain industry. As a stable price encrypted digital
currency and can be used as a decentralized leveraged trading platform, the following is
a QuickCash stable monetary system ready for immediate use potential market
(including the block chain industry and other industries) incomplete List:

Predicting Markets and Gaming Applications : In forecasts that are not related to betting
currencies, people are reluctant to use a price-constant cryptocurrency to place a bet.
Especially for those who bet the price of an asset to future price instability for a long
time dimension of gambling can not be achieved. Alternatively, similar to the QuickCash
stable currency coins encrypted with the predicted market price stability for the user is
betting and natural selection.

Financial markets : hedging risks, derivatives, leveraged trading, etc. CDP makes it

easier for users to make leveraged transactions. QuickCash Stabilizer is a stable and
reliable collateral asset that can be used in custom derivative smart contracts such as
options and CFDs.

Business receipts, remittances and cross-border transactions: reducing foreign
exchange fluctuations, and remove the middleman, which means that QuickCash stable
currency able to significantly reduce the transaction costs of international trade.

Transparent accounting system: charitable, non-profit organizations and government
departments can achieve more efficient and low corruption by using QuickCash stable
currency accounting system.

6 Conclusion

QuickCash stabilizes the monetary system to address the important issue of stable
value exchange in the blockchain economy and in the broader global financial
markets. We believe QuickCash create a stable currency, repurchase transactions and
mechanisms to effectively maintain price stability QuickCash stable currency. The
QuickCash team has established a prudent management roadmapand governance
approach that is suitable for both short-term agile development and long-term
decentralized design. We have ambitious development plans, and to ensure a stable
currency QuickCash responsibility can be widely used.

WHITE PAPER

Electra is an open-source community cryptocurrency project featuring decen-
tralized and distributed governance. Electra’s foundation is a blockchain based
on the NISTS5 algorithm, guaranteeing fast and secure transactions with nearly
non-existent transaction costs.

Electra’s goal is to become the electric current of the cryptocurrency communi-
ty. Our vision is to advance the evolution of our economic system as originally
proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto.

Electra is a unique cryptocurrency in that it is both a development project and

a contract. Despite being a fully operational cryptocurrency at present, Electra
is an ongoing development project subject to review, innovation, and updating.
Electra is also a contract that offers the investor full participation in the deve-
opment process, including but not limited to the following:

Access to Technical Support

The Electra Blockchain and the ECA coin are a product of the combined skil-
Is and abilities of an ever-growing community of coders, developers, business
professionals and other contributors. ECA is built on a fully functional and fe-
ature rich blockchain with a stable and solid foundation. This foundation pro-
vides the reliable platform needed for our talented community of developers

to innovate, invent and build upon. Blockchain technology evolves on a daily
basis. As this technology improves, ECA’s foundation will expand and grow in
tandem with the latest innovations.

Digital currency was created to bring change to the financial world through
the decentralization and disintermediation of the global financial ecosystem.
Progress towards this goal has thus far been inhibited by insufficient technical
tools that alone are simply not enough to affect mass adoption of blockchain
technology. Recent technological developments are only now beginning to
unlock new possibilities, resulting in paradigm shifts within the cryptocur-
rency ecosystem regarding the scalability, accessibility, speed, and cost of

blockchain applications.

The opportunity for dramatic change within a developing ecosystem is unfortu-
nately time limited. Newly developed systems evolve quickly, rapidly reaching
a point where progressive and lasting change is inhibited by the structures
built during each stage of evolution. As blockchain technology moves towards

structural boundaries within the ecosystem there is a period of time in whi-
ch greater freedom of action for the evolutionary forces at work is possible.
For cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology as a whole, that time is now.

PS] electra
WHITE PAPER

Electra is positioned to become one of the main driving forces of change while
these windows of opportunity remain open.

Participants within the traditional economic structure are attempting to em-
ploy old logic to adapt to the ongoing restructuring of our economic system,
subverting the original intent behind the cryptocurrency movement. The cryp-
tocurrency community must recapture the original spirit behind decentrali-

zation and the Electra Project is prepared to lead the way. ECA owners are no
longer just investors in a cryptocurrency. Instead, by being directly involved
in the decision making process investors take part in the entire underlying
structure: code innovation, design, marketing, community building, and strate-
gic business development.

Through this process, participants within the economic system are no longer

relegated to being mere consumers. Electra returns the power to the people,
and assigns members of the community an active role in the evolution of our
economic and monetary systems.

Electrifying
the Cryptocurrency
Community

Electra is more than a common digital currency. It is a currency backed by an

entire community of dedicated individuals. Electra’s goal is to create the stron-
gest possible community of individuals who all share the same philosophy of
change with regards to global monetary systems. Through transparency and
empowerment, we are shining a new light on a darkening system. This is not a
zero sum game; this is Electra.

PS] electra
WHITE PAPER

Our vision for Electra is that it becomes the largest and most active crypto-
currency community within the market space. An active global community
provides investors an opportunity to assume roles as active players and con-
tributors. Electra is not only a decentralized organization, but a unique and
powerful revolution based on shared ownership and collaboration among the
skilled experts throughout our community.

Investor Benefit

ECA investors hold a stake in the Electra organization and are encouraged to
become directly involved in the development process. All investors are owners
of both the cryptocurrency and the entire infrastructure that exists behind the
project.

Innovative and Open Development Process

The underlying architecture of the Electra Project is continuously subjected to
multiple stages of validation. Through the validation process only the most va-
luable changes are adopted and integrated. Any and all decisions are subjected
to review by the community prior to implementation. Even an optimal system
has limits. Guarantees of reversibility and the highest level of quality are nee-
ded. One of Electra’s strengths is the ability to adapt and consistently meet the
needs of a changing global environment.

Building and deconstructing simultaneously is necessary to create the best
possible product given the current limitations, and at the same time provide
for the ability to further refine the product. In doing so we must accept the pos-
sibility that the existing technology has room to improve or that the underlying
factors of previous developments have changed. Our methodology allows for
continuous evolution of the technology within a changing environment. The

resulting development will produce the best possible product at any given time.

PS] electra
WHITE PAPER

Electra Sets New Standards for Cryptocurrencies

The best product is the one capable of becoming completely different from its
origins. Today, the leading cryptocurrencies on the market can only guarantee
their relevance to investors for an ephemeral period. What is now at the fore-
front of the market will soon be outdated and outclassed by innovative compe-
titors.

As acommunity we synthesize and condense the vision of many individuals,
compare and contrast diverse viewpoints, and examine possible outcomes.
The results of this process are subjected to review and analysis by a multitude
of viewpoints, allowing for the systematic detection of probable errors.

[his approach ensures that only the most valid ideas survive to reach imple-
mentation. To reach our goals it is necessary to widen the scope of discussion
as much as possible and to extend an open dialogue indefinitely.

The end result of our efforts is the Electra Project.

he Electra Project's primary points of focus are the following:

@ Design and build the most cutting edge cryptocurrency
@ Create a financial ecosystem for the community
@ Ensure that the project is driven by community needs

@ Evolve the product over time, utilizing best practices

WHITE PAPER

The Algorithm

ECA is built using an algorithm that guarantees security; NISTS. NISTS5 is an al-
gorithm developed using the best features of the five SHA-3 finalist algorithms
as selected by the National Institute of Standards and Technology of Ameri-
ca. In practice, the NIST5 algorithm as implemented in ECA selects the most
beneficial attributes of each component algorithm to maximize performance,
security, and efficiency. These component algorithms include:

The Electra Blockchain

The underlying blockchain of the ECA coin utilizes a modified version of the
NISTS5 algorithm with the following properties:

Block Size: 1MB

Block Time: 5 minutes (288 blocks per day)

Max Supply: 30,000,000,000

Pre-mined: 1,000,000,019 (Approximately 3.34%)

Difficulty Target: Retarget occurs every 15 minutes (every 3 blocks)
Fee: 0.00001 ECA

Purpose and Use of Pre-mined ECA

1,000,000,019 (Approximately 3.34%) ECA were pre-mined using Proof of Work
(PoW) mining. Pre-mined funds are maintained by a trusted Community Funds
Manager. Distribution and use of funds is determined by consensus. Pre-mined
funds will be used for various purposes including but not limited to the following:

be electra
WHITE PAPER

@ Maintaining the security and usability of the platform
@ Funding further development projects as outlined by our roadmap
@ Application to new exchanges

Fast Payments

ECA transactions are received in the recipient's wallet almost instantly and
the ECA received is spendable as soon as the transaction is confirmed in the

blockchain. The confirmation process requires less than five minutes.
Transaction Fees Approaching Zero

With transaction fees on the Electra network of 0.00001 ECA, it takes 100,000
transactions to accumulate one ECA worth of transaction fees (approximately

$0.004 USD at time of this publication). The resulting cost per transaction is
approximately $0.00000004.

Staking Rewards

ECA features a 50% annual stake reward rate. There is no fixed reward per block.
Each stake reward is proportional to the amount staked relative to the total
ECA in circulation. Additional information regarding the Proof of Stake reward

structure for ECA can be found at:
https://electraproject.org/crypto-wallet-staking-gquide-electra-project

Optional Privacy

Future developments within the Electra ecosystem will allow for the use of
privacy gateways, including but not limited to the following.
@ TOR @ [P2network @ Kovri

PS] electra
WHITE PAPER

Users will be able to select the privacy functions best suited to their individual
needs. The Electra community is continually working to identify the most sca-
lable and efficient gateway configurations to ensure privacy of transactions.

Environmentally Friendly

The NISTS5 algorithm utilized by the ECA cryptocurrency is more environmen-
tally friendly than competing technologies and has proven to be a sustainable
option for deployment of blockchain-based systems. NIST5 requires signifi-
cantly less energy to run than competing algorithms without compromising
the security of network members.

Furthermore, Electra does not have an extended Proof of Work (PoW) phase.

Electra’s blockchain network is now Proof of Stake (PoS) which results in no
miners and a greatly reduced carbon footprint.

When you invest in ECA you become a stakeholder in a fully open source
project aimed at developing the most cutting edge technology for the evolution
of cryptocurrency. Investors who choose Electra will be a part of this journey.

Current technology is a good starting point however, creating the cryptocur-
rency of the future requires going beyond the limits of existing technology.

The strength of Electra resides in the contract that guarantees investors full
participation in the direction of the project, including all future developmen-
ts and technologies. ECA's potential growth is guaranteed because tomorrow's

ECA will not be just another coin, but rather an adaptation to future societal

and economic needs. Investors can be confident that when they purchase ECA,

PS] electra
WHITE PAPER

they are investing in the present and future growth of a unique cryptocurrency
ecosystem.

If an algorithm emerges that is more efficient and superior to NISTS5, Electra’s
development team is prepared to adapt ECA's underlying structure to maintain

a competitive advantage in the market. As Electra grows the block time can be
reduced and the block size can be increased. The adaptability of ECA allows for
the blockchain to be maintained while the algorithm is rewritten from scratch.
In effect Electra is a blank paper for writing revolutionary code. Writing the
code of the future on an already active codebase results in a deployed structu-
re that neither obstructs, limits, nor hinders future development. ECA’s archi-

tecture allows a subsequent structure to intersect, connect, flank or replace the

existing structure. Electra provides a better solution than existing currencies
can and guarantees the community full control.

In order for merchants to complete transactions, they need to be able to accept
payments from consumers. In today's world merchants do not have the proper
technical tools at their disposal for accepting digital currency as a form of pay-
ment. Merchants that do accept digital currencies are paying extremely high
fees to do so.

Despite the proliferation of technology across the globe, many developing re-
gions of the world continue to operate within a system where the ‘Cash is King’

philosophy remains dominant in conducting commerce. Ease of adoption pro-
vided by the Electra ecosystem combined with easy access to mobile Internet

in developing countries provides a secure, fast, and low fee payment gateway
for both consumers and merchants alike, regardless of where they live.

ElectraPay

ElectraPay is acommunity driven payment solution for merchants. The codebase
consists of a centralized payment facility connected to plugins available for most
e-commerce platforms including Magento, WooCommerce and Shopify.

The ElectraPay system allows merchants to receive payments for their goods
and services by easily installing the plugin to their e-commerce websites. Cu-
stomers will then be able to select ECA as a payment method. The plugin will

convert the fiat value to ECA using the latest official ECA price as drawn from
multiple exchanges. The customer is then shown a payment address along with
a QR code.

When the ElectraPay system detects initiation of a payment, it sends a validation
call to the merchant's website and routes the ECA through the ElectraPay system to
obfuscate the final payment address. Merchants using this plugin can be confident
that their transactions and wallets are secure and concealed from the customer.

PS] electra
WHITE PAPER

Merchants will easily be able to install the ElectraPay plugin to their online stores
and the plugin is fully customizable to suit the merchant's needs. Merchants wan-
ing to use custom code in their own payment page will be able to do so with the
open ElectraPay API. Below is a chart showing the various building blocks of the

ElectraPay system.

SocialPay

SocialPay by Electra is an automated application that enables individuals and
organizations to leverage the power of Social Media. This is accomplished by ini-
tiating ECA transactions on a large scale, allowing content providers and organi-

zations to send or receive ECA within their existing Social Media audiences.

Electra’s Social Pay application is currently integrated with the platforms of
Twitter, Telegram, Discord and Slack. As development of this service continues
additional Social Media platforms will be added to include Facebook, Reddit,
Instagram, Weibo, and others.

Who Is SocialPay For?

The current version of SocialPay is designed for communities who would like

to send or receive ECA using their favorite Social Media platform. SocialPay al-

lows users to send and receive ECA by simply posting a message to their Social
Media account. This message can be either public or private.

Possible scenarios where SocialPay could be used include but are not limited
to the following.

@ Content creators and non-profit organizations accepting donations
@ Rewards-based community building

@ Crowdfunding

@ Participation in ICO or Token Sales

Provided below is an example of how SocialPay may be used.

@ The Red Cross is responding to an emergency situation and would like

to raise funds to provide relief for those affected. By using the Electra

PS] electra
WHITE PAPER

SocialPay application and asking their followers for donations via
Twitter, they can reach their entire audience within minutes. Once the

application is set up, any Twitter user will be able to send an ECA do-
nation via a direct message to the Red Cross. The Red Cross will then

instantly receive the ECA within its account and be able to use the
funds where they are most needed.

Future developments within Electra’s SocialPay application are aimed at
expanding the possible field of Social Media participants.

Why Atomic Swaps?

Thousands of cryptocurrencies are currently in existence and the number con-
tinues to grow exponentially as blockchain technology is adopted. It remains
a complex task to exchange one cryptocurrency for another when payment
needs require different currencies. Cryptocurrency transactions are currently
not reversible. This requires the use of a trusted third party to ensure that both
sides of a transaction are resolved, so exchanges are used to accomplish the
trading of different cryptocurrencies. The Electra community understands the
need to fill this void. Atomic Swaps is the answer.

Electra’s atomic swap architecture generates a hash-time-locked contract,
which uses multi-signature addresses and time locks to secure the transaction
at an agreed upon price.

In a two-party cryptocurrency transaction using atomic swaps on transactions
on differing blockchains can occur simultaneously and can be secured by the
sharing of a private code between both parties. Use of the private code by one
party will only complete the transaction if the second party also uses the same
private code. Failure by one party to send the agreed upon amount of currency or
to enter the correct code results in cancellation of the transaction and the return
of all funds to their original location. This process removes the need for trusted
third party intervention.

Imagine you want to use ECA to pay for pizza at a restaurant that accepts only
Bitcoin. A complex series of operations must first take place as illustrated be-
low

Access an exchange

Send ECA to exchange

Sell ECA for Bitcoin

Open a Bitcoin wallet application

Transfer Bitcoin to wallet from the exchange

Wait for the bitcoin transaction to confirm

Pay for your (cold) pizza

It is easy to see why the process is not currently used in commercial inte-
ractions at the retail level.

Applying Atomic Swaps

The following is a list of operations that would be required with Atomic Swap
technology employed in the same transaction: paying for pizza with ECA at an
establishment that only accepts Bitcoin.

@ Open your Electra application
@ Scan the Bitcoin QRCode
@ Confirm the payment within the application

PS] electra
WHITE PAPER

Atomic Swap technology greatly reduces the complexity of the transaction
between customer and merchant by removing the necessity of knowing which

cryptocurrency is accepted at a given location. Both the non-ECA blockchain

and the ECA blockchain confirm the transaction. If either blockchain rejects

the transaction ECA is returned to the customer's wallet.

Master Node implementation is an essential part of the ECA development

process. Implementing Master Nodes on the ECA network will provide the fol-
lowing main benefits:

@ Faster Transactions on the ECA Network

@ Increased Privacy of Transactions

@ Improved Health and Stability of the ECA Network
@ Improved Decentralization of the ECA Ecosystem

To initiate and run a Master Node, Electra community members apply to the
core development team to obtain Node specifications and requirements. De-
velopment of Master Nodes on the ECA network is ongoing. Refer to the most
recent version of the roadmap for target release dates.

"The main goals I had when creating Electra was for it to be able to remain
active indefinitely and easy to use. A key component to achieve these goals
is an active community. In less than a year, the community has progressed
immensely and is a completely self-governing entity that can act without my
interference. The whitepaper itself is written by the community which may be
a first in the blockchain sector. The current parameters of Electra take into ac-
count security, privacy, speed and efficiency. It is a solid template to build upon.

The new community roadmap is ambitious and aims to make Electra a premier
cryptocurrency. For these goals, as well as my own, the development team has
been expanded and will also eventually become self-governing. Just as I have
done so far, I will aid Electra’s expansion and provide funding when necessary
for future endeavours.” Electra01

The Open Paper

This White Paper does not end here. Electra’s White Paper is the beginning of a
much more comprehensive shared document known as an “Open Paper”. The
Open Paper will be the reference technical sheet for the Electra Project and
will be open to contributors to ensure ongoing development. The Open Paper is
available on Github within the official Electra Project page and is available for
all who wish to contribute to the growth of the project.

https://github.com/Electra-project/Electra-Open-Paper/blob/
master/ElectraWhitePaper-TheOpenPaper.md

The Electra Community, in collaboration with Electra’s Core Team, is committed
to reviewing and updating the Open Paper and implementing additional propo-
sals and projects on a monthly basis, starting with the release of our White Paper.
Every user is called upon to contribute. If you disagree with suggestions proposed

please feel free to express your opinion and provide your constructive criticism.
Your input and feedback are the driving force behind Electra’s development.

Next White Paper update: February 28, 2018

Ledger of Everything

Global decentralized location service infrastructure that benefits all

White Paper V3.0.0

Abstract

GoWithMi aims to build a distributed map ecosystem through blockchain, AI
and GIS (Geographic Information System) technology, which enables anyone (any
node) to initiate and autonomously perform use, update and maintenance of maps
without depending on any centralization organization in the entire process.

The maturity of 5G, loT, Edge AI and other technologies as well as the breakout
of blockchain reveal the advent of the new era of Internet of everything, which will
become the third generation of the Internet after the first generation of PC Internet
and the second generation of mobile Internet.

The spatial location information of people and things in the real world need map
to realize digital, so that they can be perceived by the digital universe. In this sense,
the map is the “Ledger of Everything” that records the spatial location. It provides a
connection service from the real world to the digital world by recording the “spatial
location” which the real world mapped to the digital world.

Just like the original intention of the Bitcoin was to break the “payment
monopoly”, GoWithMi was originally designed to break the “map monopoly”. In the
first and second generation of the Internet, the map is in the hands of a handful of
Internet tycoons represented by Google. This triggers a series of obvious drawbacks:
abuse of personal information, leak of personal privacy [1], arbitrary price hike of
map service that businesses need[2], or even shut down of map service [3], and so on.
If this situation stay unchanged, the Internet of everything will still be threatened by
“map monopoly”.

To change this situation and break the map monopoly, GoWithMi explores the
“decentralization” practice mainly from technology and community governance:

1. GoWithMi’s main chain — the technical realization of peer-to-peer map
network Gaia

Gaia is a peer-to-peer map network completely. Map data update, map service
provision and maintenance can be initiated from any node in the network and
cooperate as needed throughout the whole network without any centralization
mechanism. The TPS or supporting governance mechanisms of the existing
blockchain projects such as BTC, ETH, and EOS, cannot meet the application
needs in non-financial scenarios. We propose the spatial geographic
computing architecture (GeoMesh Computing Architecture) to allow the data
structure and core algorithm in the map industry to combine with the peer-to-

2/ 42
GoWithMi White Paper V3.0.0 All Rights Reserved
peer (Peer-to-Peer) network and consensus mechanism of the blockchain in
their “gene level”, so as to provide a peer-to-peer map network that combines
the map service with the decentralized self-organization of blockchain.

The detailed method is:

@ Designing a new basic map data structure GeoMesh, which enables basic
map data to be segmented into a large number of discrete and small-sized
GeoMesh data;

@ Designing a consensus mechanism like PoW (PoCW, Proof of
Compilation Work) that allows multiple nodes to create and update map
data by mesh (Mesh) like block-by-block ledger-keeping;

@ Realizing a peer-to-peer network mechanism that allows GeoMesh to be
synchronized between nodes on demand;

@ Reconstructing the core algorithm to allow the node to provide a complete
map service in a specified area based on the currently cached GeoMesh
rather than synchronizing all map data;

@ Designing a proof mechanism (PoG, Proof of GeoMesh) to enable the
node to prove its map service capability simply through the effectively
cached GeoMesh;

@ Designing a ledger-keeping consensus design for blockchains in non-
financial scenarios (DPoG) that allows all nodes to maintain the same
voting rights and map service obligations to the ledger-keeping nodes.

Based on the designing philosophy of GCA (GeoMesh Computing
Architecture), Gaia will coordinate the computing resources of all nodes in
the whole network effectively . Compared with the PoW consensus, the
PoCW makes those node computing power which are participated in this
consensus spend in the "map data compilation", a service benefits the map
service, and let the computing power game between the nodes can be used to
ensure the consistency of the core map service resource "GeoMesh". Based
on the results of the PoCW work, the entire network nodes can synchronize
the GeoMesh on demand to ensure the consistency of the entire network map
service (PoG) and the fairness of the accounting node election (DPoG). Based
on the planning of such computing power, under the premise of ensuring data
consistency, service consistency and fair governance, the computing resources
of most nodes of the whole network can be released to the map service itself,
thereby increasing the TPS of the network by a thousand times or even
thousands of times compared with that of the existing public chain.

2. The organization and governance of the map ecosystem and other business
that goes with the main chain Gaia, including:

@ AnAtTand human-machine collaborative data collection network
combining Token and Edge AI that could shorten the single data data
collection time from ten minutes to ten milliseconds.

@ A decentralized governance mechanism for map data rights which takes
into account both the investment efficiency and investment efficiency of
map data.

@ A decentralized governance mechanism for core ecological business
resources that ensure optimal utilization of core resources.

If BTC is a Peer to Peer version of “financial ledger” , then GoWithM1 is the
Peer to Peer version of “Ledger of Everything”. The blockchain revolution
represented by BTC, ETH, and EOS reveals the possibility of participants playing
positive-sum game based on a distributed network to co-construct ecology. GoWithMi
hopes to extend this kind of “self-governance” in positive-sum game to non-financial
scenarios, to decentralize the “ledger-keeping rights” of the map - “Ledger of
Everything”, thus build the next generation of global decentralized location service
infrastructure that benefits all.

Chapter I Mission and Vision

Mission

GoWithMi is committed to becoming the global decentralized location service
infrastructure by building a global human-machine collaborative map network and
reshaping the map ecosystem through blockchain, AI and GIS technology.
Meanwhile, as a decentralized map component for all public chains, GoWithMi is
dedicated to facilitate blockchain industry to empower transportation, travel,
accommodation, e-commerce, advertising, gaming, location intelligence, autonomous
driving and other large-scale application scenarios that rely heavily on maps.

Vision

Internet infrastructure like map services should be designed and managed as
public product. GoWithMi’s main chain, Gaia, will fill the global capital and
technology gaps, allowing people in emerging markets to build a map network
through idle computer or even idle phone rather than purchasing many expensive
servers; allowing people to update and improve map services by themselves according
to their own needs rather than relying on large international companies to collect bulk
data; empowering blockchain and Internet developers around the world with a map
dAPI that will not leak privacy, will not be forced to raise prices and shut down;
empowering all businesses that need maps, including transportation, travel,
accommodation and e-commerce, with a low cost and high quality underlying map
service that never shut down.

Chapter II The Challenges and Solutions

for Blockchains in Non-financial Scenarios

Data and Computing Power

The requirements for scalability and data storage for blockchains in non-
financial projects far exceed the existing blockchain projects. Baidu Map needs to
provide 120 billion location services per day [4]; that’s about 1,388,889 TPS every
minute, which is 86,806 times of Ethereum, 347 times of EOS, and 694 times of
TRON. The Gigabyte-level data storage required for map data is also significantly
larger than the existing ledger data storage size. Obviously, it is difficult to meet such
computing and storage needs under the existing blockchain technology framework

and consensus.

In this whitepaper, we introduce the GeoMesh technology architecture which
enables the peer-to-peer map network to solve both the computing and storage needs
of the map service, and propose a complete decentralized solution for all key services

of the map service. For details, please refer to Chapter III.

Consensus in the Real World

From the perspective of game theory, the existing blockchain consensus can be
abstracted into a positive-sum game based on distributed systems. Whether under
the PoW or the PoS consenus, the game behaviors of participants has been abstracted
into extremely simple behaviors, such as calculation of SHA256 hash and the
mortgage of stake.

However, existing Internet services require a lot of collaborative work in the real
world. The complexity of such collaboration cannot be abstracted into simple
behaviors. Although we can set up mortgages, competition and other measures to
motivate and punish participants, participants’ learning costs and cognitive biases in
work in the real world will still lead to unexpected outcomes in the consensus-driven
human collaboration.

GoWithMi White Paper V3.0.0 All Rights Reserved
Fortunately, the outbreak of the AI technology revolution brings us a new
possibility. We can standardize and streamline the behavior of all participants with the
aid of AI algorithm. By cooperating with Edge AI hardware, AI could automatically
assist to complete the work that would otherwise take participants hours or even days
to learn. Participants can complete the data collection work that meets the
requirements simply by taking the equipment to the designated area. Such human-
machine collaboration makes the consensus-driven collaboration in reality as elegant
as PoW in BTC.

Governance of Map Data

Most Internet services can be considered as an extension of their data
applications, and data is the core production material of the Internet. Most of the
existing blockchain governance can be understood as the governance of “ledger-
keeping rights”. Most projects do not design and answer the question of how to
govern the ownership and the maintenance obligation of data.

The core production material of map is map data. Based on its spatial
characteristics, GoWithMi maps all the rights and maintenance obligations of the map
data to different pieces of virtual lands that are corresponding to reality. Each piece of
land becomes a space node (GoZone).

Based on such data governance design, we have transformed the global map data
governance into spatial node governance based on independent regions. We are
fortunate to b design a spatial node governance mechanism based on “Harberger
taxes’’. In the digital space world, “Harberger taxes” does not have real-world
constraints, so we could govern the rights and obligations of data elegantly through
the governance of spatial nodes.

Chapter III The Main Chain Gaia

Distributed Storage and Distributed Computing

SETI@home

SETI@Home[6] is the world’s best-known and largest distributed computing
project. It began to use distributed computing to analyze electromagnetic waves from
the universe and find extraterrestrial civilization in the 1990s. The success of
SETI@Home proves the feasibility of providing services through distributed
computing. Inspired by SETI@Home, Gaia regarded map service as a public course
that the international community could participate in the same way as finding
extraterrestrial civilizations, and provide global decentralized location service
infrastructure through the integration of idle computing power.

IPFS

IPFS is a master of successful open source distributed systems in recent decades,
providing an excellent distributed storage protocol solution for subsequent projects.
Gaia focuses on the development of distributed map services on the network transport
ayer. It can be considered as a distributed map network that realizes some IPFS
protocols in some sense, which is exemplary for the distribution transformation of the
subsequent Internet projects..

Map Technology and Spatial Geographic Grid Computing

Architecture

Background Knowledge of Map Technology

In general, map technology can be divided into two parts:

@ Map Data Compilation
A series of data collected from the real world, such as road shape, traffic rules, the
name and location of POI (Point Of Interest), cannot be directly used by
commercial-level map services. To reorganize the data structure, different indexes
need to be added based on different map service needs. For example, POI name

10 / 42
GoWithMi White Paper V3.0.0 All Rights Reserved
queries needs to add inverted indexes; POI peripheral queries or map displays need
to add spatial indexes; and path calculation needs to convert road data into multiple
layers of strongly connected directed graphs. These tasks are generally weekly-
level because they are full-scale structure conversion of existing data.

@ Map Service
The map service provides a series of location-based services such as place-name
query, map display, path calculation, and route guidance on the basis of generating
map data though compiling the collected data. All map-related business services
can be regarded as the combination of these basic map services.

Obviously, we need a complete and exclusive transformation of the map technology to
provide a peer-to-peer map solution.

Spatial Geographic Grid Computing Architecture (GCA)

The spatial geographic computing architecture (GCA, GeoMesh Computing
Architecture) proposed in this white paper represents a technical system and
architecture design for distributed map services, of which the design philosophy is
inherited from Grid Computing [7]. “Mesh” could better illustrate the spatial

properties of the map services in the geographic information industry.

GCA aims to design a new map service based on P2P network. Through the
redesign of the basic map data structure, the map data can achieve distributed
production based on PoCW (Proof of Compilation Work) consensus. While the map
data consistency among the network is guaranteed, each node synchronizes data on
demand, and achieves the network-wide consistency of the map service through the
network-wide consistency of the map data, so that most nodes of the entire network
no longer waste valuable computing resources on competing the ledger-keeping right
under PoW. Instead, the resources are devoted to the map service itself, thereby
increasing the TPS of the network by a thousand times or even thousands of times

compared with that of the existing public chain.

The core idea of GeoMesh is to make the map data which organized through

GeoMesh the core service resource in Gaia network. All nodes can prove their own
11 / 42
GoWithMi White Paper V3.0.0 All Rights Reserved
map service capability (Proof of GeoMesh) by themselves by storing and maintaining
a part of GeoMesh data. And from the perspective of Gaia network, each node’s
holding of service resources like GeoMesh is the proof of the contribution to the map
service. Each node uses the effective holding of GeoMesh as a stock to vote for the
ledger-keeping nodes in the network. This is called DPoG (Delegated Proof of
GeoMesh).

In general, the Spatial Geographic Computing Architecture (GCA) can be divided into
the following parts:

@ Anew basic map data structure GeoMesh which enables basic map data to be
segmented into a large number of discrete and small-sized GeoMesh data;

@ PoCW (Proof of Compilation Work) consensus mechanism that allows multiple
nodes to create and update map data by mesh (Mesh) like block-by-block ledger-
keeping;

@ A peer-to-peer network mechanism that allows GeoMesh to be synchronized
between nodes on demand;

@ The core algorithm goes with GeoMesh that allows the node to provide a
complete map service in a specified area based on the currently cached GeoMesh
rather than synchronizing all map data;

@ A proof of the node’s map service capability (Proof of GeoMesh). The node could
prove its map service capability simply through the effectively cached GeoMesh;

@ A ledger-keeping consensus for blockchains in non-financial scenarios (DPoG)
that allows all nodes to maintain the same voting rights and map service

obligations to the ledger-keeping nodes.

The map service features access aggregation. Hardly do the taxi driver in Beijing
need to know the location of the Los Angeles supermarket. Access aggregation makes
GeoMesh enjoy a very high cache hit rate, thus making it possible to provide city-
level map services with a single node with limited GeoMesh.

The core of GeoMesh’s data structure is decoupling and parallelizing map data.
Decoupling means that an independent GeoMesh data can provide the data needed for
map services in a few square kilometers without any other data; Parallelizing means
that several adjacent GeoMesh data can provide all the data of the map service in the
corresponding range in parallel without any additional processing means.

Figure 1. GeoMesh segements the map data.

The data structure features of GeoMesh allow map nodes to synchronize and
cache GeoMesh as simple as the way IPFS nodes cache images.

In terms of network structure, I designed a two-level node structure, which is
Root Node and Edge Node. Any hardware device, including server, PC or mobile
phone, can be a node to participate in the Gaia map network. They can choose to
become one kind of node or both kinds of nodes at the same time.

Root Node and Automatic Compilation

Root Node

The “root” in the “root node” comes from the root name server [8]. It uses the
role of the root name server in the Domain Name Service (DNS) [9] to analogize the
role of the root node in the Gaia network.

In the actual operation of the DNS system, most of the domain name resolutions
do not need to access the root name server, and the mapping relationship of the top-
level domain (TLD) [10] has been cached in the nodes of the DNS system. But we
can rebuild the entire DNS system based on the root name server at any time.

In the Gaia network, GeoMesh data is generated between the root nodes through
PoCW. GeoMesh will synchronize to the Gaia nodes as needed. Most of the map
service requests do not require the root node, either. The root node’s role in Gaia is
more like a provider of rules than a provider of services.

Data Compilation Workload Proof (PoC W)

Bitcoin’s PoW mechanism provides a very good example of how to maintain the
data consistency among the whole network. Based on the “one CPU, one vote”
principle, the decision of the “honest majority” is expressed as the longest chain
which outruns other competing chains, thus ensuring the ledger data of the whole
network is consistent.

Proof of Compilation Work (PoCW) inherits the design principle of PoW. It
makes the data compilation of map production a legder-keeping process and the
GeoMesh-based data compilation and production a block production process; it also
makes the decision of the “honest majority” expressed as the longest chain, thus
ensuring the map data consistency among the whole network.

Automatic Compilation and GeoMesh

The automatic compilation of map data without human intervention is the
premise of the de-centralized production of map data. So far, there is no map data
automatic compilation project available for commercial use worldwide. We need to
make different modifications based on the data compilation of different map service
modules. Fortunately, we are “standing on the shoulders of giants”.

14 / 42
GoWithMi White Paper V3.0.0 All Rights Reserved
Spatial index technology is relatively mature in the map industry. Quadtree [11]
has almost become the industry standard; Web Mercator projection [12] and GeoHash
[13] provide very good references in application.

The inverted index technology is also relatively mature, and a large number of
existing projects such as Solr [14] and ElasticSearch [15] provide good references for
creating real-time index.

The difficulty of GeoMesh technology lies in the automatic compilation of path
planning, of which the purpose is to transform the road network composed of all roads
into a strongly connected directed graph [16], so as to use the Dijkstra algorithm [17]
or the A* algorithm [18] to obtain the optimal path from location A to lacation B.
Although “boundary node” technology allows road network data to be segmented
based on spatial index without additional indexes, the inspection of road networks and
even the production of strongly connected directed graphs require human intervention
for a long time, which is almost the most labor-intensive part of the indoor operation
in traditional map business.

Fortunately, the advancement of the algorithm makes full automation possible.
Tarjan’s algorithm [19] allows the system to automatically detect “isolated subgraphs”
on the road network, preventing drop-dead halt in path computation. Contraction
hierarchies algorithm[20] provides a way to rarefy road network without losing any
optimal path between higher nodes, making the high-level road network possible,
which the automatic compilation and production of mainland-level path calculation

requires.

Edge node and Distributed Map Service

Edge Node

The edge nodes in the Gaia network have no cap on the number. The role of the
edge nodes is to provide nearby map services based on their own hardware, network
conditions and geographic location. The maps could range from a city, a country or to
the whole world. Edge nodes can be deployed on servers, PCs, and even mobile
phones. We call it “everything could mine”.

Proof of Service Capability (PoG)

PoG is a mechanism that allows Edge Nodes to prove their map capabilities
through the effectively cached GeoMesh.

After Gaia guarantees the map service consistency through GeoMesh data
consistency based on proof of compilation workload (PoCW) , the spatial index of
GeoMesh in parallel directly describes the range of map services that can be provided.
In this way, Edge Node can prove its service capability by caching such service
resources of GeoMesh, which referred to as PoG (Proof of GeoMesh). Gaia matches
the Edge Node which proves its service capabilities through PoG with the nearby
corresponding map service needs.

Peer-to-Peer Network and GeoMesh

One of the original design purposes of GeoMesh data structure is to make the
size of the map data conform to the transmission requirements of the P2P network. In
the PoC (Proof of Concept) test, one single GeoMesh data can be controlled at around
800K, and can provide map display and path planning services within the range of
3.6*2.4 square kilometers..

16 / 42
GoWithMi White Paper V3.0.0 All Rights Reserved
Figure 4. The available map area of 800k GeoMesh in the PoC test.

With GeoMesh as the carrier, the global map data is transmitted and stored in the
P2P network in a distributed way. Each node only needs to synchronize and store the
required parts. Gaia’s map service will be provided by a large number of edge nodes
scattered around the world. Since real-time synchronization is not required, the node’s
own computing power is used to provide map services. In this way, Gaia provides
low-cost map services with no TPS limit theoretically.

Map dAPI

Based on the P2P map network, Gaia can provide a secure and transparent map
service that never ends, which we call dAPI.

Any blockchain project, Internet company or individual developer can deploy
their own edge nodes based on open source code in the future. The deployment
environment can be a secure environment chosen by the developer. After the edge
node is connected to the network, the developer only needs to pay Gas to get the map
service.

Gaia provides decentralized map dAPI in a completely transparent way, eliminating the possibility

of evil conduct at the center.

Ledger and DPoG

The Governance of Ledger-keeping Right and GeoMesh

We tried to design a consensus to govern the ledger-keeping right on Gaia, so
that each node’s right to vote for the ledger-keeping node is related to its contribution
to the entire network map service.

GeoMesh provides a simple solution to directly link the map service capability
of each node to the nodes’s effectively cached map data. So the contribution of each
node to the whole map network ecology can be abstractly quantized into the node’s
effectively cached map data in GeoMesh format.

Service Voting Proof (DPoG)

DPoG can be considered as a variant of DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) in
essence, except that we convert the interest brought by the holding into the interest
brought by service resources held by the nodes (GeoMesh).

Each node obtains voting rights to the ledger-keeping node based on the valid
GeoMesh cache, thereby unifying their rights and obligations in Gaia.

Chapter IV Human-machine Collaboration

in the Real World

Data Collection and Map

Information like the location of the store, the name of the road, etc., need to be
collected and processed by people to form the original data in the electronic map in a
standard format. The map industry refers to such work as “map data collection”. In
traditional map enterprises, the biggest cost comes from data collection. Both Chinese
American companies finish this work through intensive labor. Even Google can’t
invest enough manpower and material resources in each country in the emerging
markets to ensure that map data quality in emerging markets is the same as in
developed countries. This is why Google Maps can’t deliver map services of the same
quality throughout the world.

Distributed data collection does not have this problem. Through the management
of consensus and incentives, we can break through the organization and management
limitations in traditional industry and let people all over the world participate in data
collection.

The Governance of Distributed Data Collection

Most governance of distributed cooperation can be considered as the
establishment of a self-assessment system. All self-assessment systems can be easily
divided into two parts: self-declaration and verification by others. So distributed data
collection is also divided into two phases:

@ Collection phase (self-declaration): After collecting the data, the data does not
immediately enter the compilation process. The collector needs to mortgage his
or her own token to inspire others to verify.

@ Verification by others: After the collector mortgages the token, it will attract other
participants to verify the data. If the data is verified to be true, both the collector
and the verifier will acquire incentives. If it’s verified to be false, the verifier will
split the collector’s mortgaged token.

Token-driven Edge AI and Distributed Human-machine

Collaboration

Edge AI can be considered as a distributed revolution in AI computing, freeing
AI computing power from the constraints of the center and providing it to edge
devices.

We believe that Edge AI is naturally driven by Token, and this Token-driven
Edge AI is naturally combined with human-involved data collection activities.

We will use GIS and Edge AI technology to create an ecological spatial data
mining machine. The carrier can be AI hardware for car, near space vehicle or even
satellite. We'll make map data collection process standardized, automated and
efficient to let the consensus algorithm perfectly facilitate human to participate in
collecting map data in the real world, thus realizing perfect human-machine
collaboration, interpersonal collaboration and machine collaboration.

Figure 6. AI collaboration of token-driven Air-ground integration

The AI data collection protocol will be open to third parties, making it possible
for all Edge AI devices to participate in data collection.

20 / 42
GoWithMi White Paper V3.0.0 All Rights Reserved
Currently we have made the following AI collection attempts:

AI space data mining machine

Figure 7. Al hardware in development

This is GoWithMi’s exclusive data collection hardware. After the miner fixes the
equipment on the vehicle, the camera on the equipment will receive continuous
driving video. The customized AI chip will automatically identify the traffic signs,
lane lines, intersection turns, POI along the way and other spatial data that maps need.
The AI hardware shortens the time of collecting one single unit of map data from ten
minutes (collected completely by human) to ten milliseconds, which greatly
accelerates the data collection process.

The Near Space Vehicle

The near space vehicle will continue to hover at a fixed altitude of 20,000 meters
for several months, with a “gaze” range covering large cities.

Figure 8. Aerial view of a near space vehicle

The near space vehicle could provide decimeter-level picture within the gaze
range. All the spatial attributes of a city such as green spaces, water systems, roads,
and buildings can be obtained directly through the picture.

Figure 9. Image sent by the near space vehicle

With near space vehicle, you can get the basic display data of a city in a few days
or even hours, and can detect all events in the city in real time, from traffic jams to
social events (demonstrations, riots) and even natural disasters (tsunami, volcanoes).

Chapter V The Governance of Map Data

From the Estate Monopoly in the Real World to the Data

Monopoly in the Internet

The status quo of the Internet is similar to that of Europe more than two hundred
years ago when the landlord holds the core production material -land. All the
dividends acquired in the industrial revolution since 1750 were in the hand of the
landlord, and the wages of the working class hadn’t changed for one hundred years.

The same story is happening in the Internet ecosystem where large Internet
companies control data - the core production material in the Internet economy, and
gain a lot of benefits, yet the Internet users can’t get any return.

After making the distributed management of data technically possible through
Gaia, we need to provide a mutually beneficial data governance system.

Decentralized Land Governance Mechanism: Harberger

taxes

Harberger taxes is essentially a “self-assessment system” for the land’s value.
Through the owner’s self-assessment of land prices and forced circulation trading,
Harberger taxes takes into account both investment efficiency and investment
efficiency in a decentralized way.

To be specific, any landowner can declare the price of his land in accordance
with his own ideas and pay taxes according to the price. Meanwhile, anyone can
purchase the land at the price set by the owner. If the owner declared a low price to
lower the tax, his land will soon be bought by others; if the owner declared a high
price to prevent others from buying the land, he or she has to pay a high tax
continuously. Based on such a game, the owner will declare the price of his land
reasonably and eventually transfer the land to the person who can truly maximize its
value.

Harberger taxes manages the rights and obligations of land in an elegant way.
Neither there will have “public land effect” resulted from unmaintained and over-
developed shared land, nor “land monopoly” where owners refuse to fulfill their
obligations and just reap the benefits.

Spatial Data Node and Map Data Management

We believe that Harbiner taxs can also be used in map data management. The
detailed approach is to divide the areas on the map into virtual land of map data
according to the corresponding reality. The map data will be assigned to a certain
piece of virtual land with certainty according to its spatial characteristics, and each
virtual land is a spatial data node (GoZone); The global map data is divided into
independent nodes based on the space node for governance; “Harberger taxes”
governance ensures optimal ecological governance efficiency between space data
nodes in a decentralized way, allowing virtual land to transfer to the people who can
truly exert its value and mobilizing the community to participate in the map
ecological construction with the highest efficiency.

Chapter VI Map Distributed Business and

Ecological Value Transfer

Maps are the top-level user traffic

20 years development from PC Internet to the mobile Internet proves that the
world’s top-level traffic only has four types: e-commerce, social, information and
map. Only applications in these four areas can serve hundreds of millions or even
billions of users for years. Especially in the era of the third generation Internet of
everything represented by loT+5G+Edge AI, the map will become the only top-level
traffic that will connect more than 50 billion IOT devices.

The trend of Internet development in the past two years is the exploration of
monetizing these top-level user traffic. Pinduoduo (Nasdaq: PDD) which monetizes
the traffic in social and Qutoutiao (Nasdaq: QTT) which monetizes the traffic in
information provide us with good references.

Traffic Management and Distributed Business

User traffic is as precious to the Internet economy as oil is to the industrial
society. We need to manage this core resource more fairly in a more distributed way.
Distributed business is such a governance method.

The detailed idea is to abstract traffic conversion services such as discount
coupon and advertisements into resources without threshold that everyone can bid for,
and the highest bidder get to use the resources. In this way, the resources will be
transferred to the merchants with higher conversion efficiency.

Figure 10. Discount coupons and digital hygiene ads along the dApp

This decentralized method will ensure the effective use of map traffic. The
GMAT consumed by the auction will be re-allocated to the owner of the GoZone
space node where the advertisement resource is located, so as to incent its
maintenance of the map data and local business promotion of the distributed business.

The Status of Current Products

The project is progressing smoothly according to the roadmap and is currently in
the stage of “2019 Q3~Q4”. The technical details are as follows:

@ Main Chain:

The core design of Gaia’s main chain has been audited, and no technical risks has
been detected. The main chain will be launched next year on the main network.
GeoMesh technology prototype has passed POC test. One single GeoMesh data can be
controlled at around 800K and able to provide map display and path planning services
within the range of 3.6*2.4 square kilometers;

High-level road network self-adaptive compilation enters the performance test
phase. At present, it only takes 68 seconds to generate a strongly connected high-level
road network in Southeast Asia’s 1,888,583 km road network.

On chain standard map service has completed 80%. Point of Interest (POI) search
module 1.0 has completed, which can support the POI search of 527,575 place names
in Indonesia (the data size is 10~30 times that of OpenStreetMap). Path planning and
guiding module 1.0 has completed and is being tested within a total area of 47,266
square kilometers in Jakarta, Indonesia and adjacent regions. The path planning and
guiding module 1.1 have completed 80%; together with the “high-level road network
automatic compilation function”, it can provide mainland-level cross-country path
calculation. The first phase of indoor map technology has completed with a data
coverage of 922,303 square meters.

Prospects

Ledger of Everything and Space Oracle

Map service is required when the smart contract is involved in the real world
scenario, such as decentralized cab-hailing, decentralized take-out and decentralized
e-commerce. If dAPI need to solve issues of using smart contract to mobilize the
people and things in the real world like calculating driving route, dispatching the
delivery man to fetch the take-out, real-time display of the cargo’s location, etc., we
need space oracles to solve the problem of letting smart contracts perceive whether
people and things effectively complete services.

The main reason why the space oracle cannot be replaced by the centralized map

“,

is related to the blockchain smart contract’s “‘self-declaration, verification by others”
design. After a node performs the smart contract, it still needs verification from other
nodes. This means the space oracle needs to give the verification node verifiable and
tamper-resistant historical spatial data. Obviously, that’s impossible for centralized
map which emphasizes timeliness and provides context-free services.

39 / 42
GoWithMi White Paper V3.0.0 All Rights Reserved
As aresult, decentralized “financial ledger” like blockchain needs to use
decentralized “Ledger of Everything” like GoCenterMi to drive everything. As Gaia’s
technology system and network architecture are the same as the blockchain, the
production of GeoMesh can be considered as a block generation behavior in essence,
which supports the complete traceability of its historical chain. All public chains need
technology like Gaia to ensure the purity of performing smart contracts related to the
real world in a decentralized way.

Worldwide Decentralized Location Service Facilities and

“Prisoner's Dilemma”

Prisoner’s dilemma exists in the map industry globally—any large Internet
company doesn’t want its own map, a HUB that connects its own real-world
information and digital information, on competitors’ servers. As a distributed and
completely neutral location service infrastructure, Gaia will free large Internet
companies from the meaningless competition of “reinventing the wheel” other than
providing a safe, low-cost solution for small and medium-sized developers,,.

Privacy Map and Interest Map

With GoWithMi providing a decentralized universal underlying map solution,
segmented map application scenario becomes possible, which otherwise could not be
realized due to the high sunk cost.

@ Privacy Map

Just like the browsing tracks on the Internet, people’s tracks in space sometimes
involve privacy issue. Gaia’s distributed map makes privacy map possible. Map
service that based on open source, verifiable and distributed nodes completely
eliminates the possibility of user information being hijacked by the bottom layer. And
for the upper layer, MPC (multi-party computing) or zero-knowledge proof
technology allow users to use the full map service without revealing their spatial
location.

It is worth emphasizing that the closed source code of centralized map and the
“black box operation” of the central server deployment make it impossible for
centralized map to prove its protection of user privacy. For centralized map, claiming
to realize privacy map is an ostrich policy.

@ Community of Interest Map

40 / 42
GoWithMi White Paper V3.0.0 All Rights Reserved
The current map is more concerned with general-purpose functions because of
data cost, but this does not mean that there is no market demand for maps that provide
data and services for niche interests.

Based on GoWithMi’s data collection system, anyone can build maps according
to their own needs. Users can form sub-map communities like “Sea-fishing Map”,
ae

“Cycling Map”, “Scenic Map” and “Agricultural Map” to build a more in-depth
community by themselves.

The Future of Distributed Autonomous Driving

Tesla’s crowdsourcing collection of autopilot data [21] reveals the trend of
autonomous driving. Autonomous driving’s requirements for data richness and real-
time performance have gradually surpassed the limit of traditional centralized data
production. While the improvement of 5G communication bandwidth blurs the
difference between the edge and the center, AI blurs the difference between
professional and non-professional data collection. Token-driven crowdsourcing data
collection will be an important data source for autonomous driving in the future.
GoWithMi’s design of the entire map ecology is in line with this trend.

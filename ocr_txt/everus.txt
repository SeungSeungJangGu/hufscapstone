Incorporated in 2017, Everus is a blockchain technology company that is pioneering the widespread
adoption of blockchain worldwide for real-life solutions. Everus enables opportunities in the blockchain
industry, and is always looking at ways to accelerate the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies

while focusing on the development of the Everus World Ecosystem and its range of user services.

its decentralized power. What we have created is a borderless digital infrastructure, designed to create

a thriving ecosystem of merchants, services, and customers which rewards its users.

Having grown tremendously over the years, Everus has increased both its customer base as well as in
its knowledge and skills in technological and mobile-centric innovations. To date, Everus has offices

3. History

In 2015, the idea of a digital financial and commercial ecosystem was born. Experiments were done
to test possible market adoption strategies to populate the ecosystem with users. Users were assigned

e-wallets and allocated tokens based on their respective contributions.

However, the usability of these tokens was limited to transfers between users and required more

features to be a viable alternative to fiat currency.

In 2016, a chat function was introduced to add value to the wallet and boarding of merchants began.
Integration with several Payment Service Providers (PSPs) opened doors to bill payments, top-ups,

and consumer networks.

With a 5% margin provided by the merchants and PSPs, discounts were given to the users instead of
being retained as profits. Naturally the user base grew, leading to increasing downloads, transactions,

mobile top-ups and purchases.

Even without advertising, the popularity of this app grew steadily across borders, traveling by word

of mouth into unexpected regions as more and more people took advantage of the discounts.

With a substantial active user base and the rise of blockchain technology and its characteristics, a
decision was made to phase out the prototype/pilot program and begin building a similar, but more

secure and decentralized financial and commercial ecosystem with the help of blockchain experts.

“The difference of this new ecosystem was that it would be built on a blockchain architecture,

and its tokens would be in the form of cryptocurrency.”

4. Founder

SRINIVAS ODDATI

Founder of Everus Technologies

Srinivas Oddati was born in 1976 in the small village of Vemulawada, Telangana, India. To help support
his family, Sri, the eldest son of a humble mill worker, left college to begin working at his first IT
development job with MS-DOS in the early 90s. With a powerful combination of talent and interest
in the field of software programming, Sri rose up the ranks through the fast-developing era of
computing. Quickly working his way up from FOXPRO programmer, he soon found himself building
systems for Midday Newspaper in Mumbai, before furthering his career by programming Billing and

Settlement Plans (BSP) for airline companies.

In 2002, Oddati relocated to Malaysia to begin work as a Visual Basic programmer with MySoft
Accounting Corporation Sdn Bhd. This kick started his journey of technopreneurship as Oddati
moved on to start his first software company OM Technologies in 2003, successfully developing

Debt Management Systems and Learning Management Solutions.

5. Problem Statement

1. The inconvenience of transactions via banking institutions
Cross border financial transactions often involve high transaction fees as well as the inconvenience
of delays as a result of bank processing times, time zones, validation, and transfer processes.

Solutions:
@ Send and receive funds to users anywhere in the world via Everus Wallet and benefit from

lower transaction costs and faster transfer times compared to those offered by banking

institutions.

2. Lack of financial services available in the market for unbanked population
With the latest figures of unbanked population globally at 1.7 billion’, it is clear that in order for
many economies to fully reach their growth potential more must be done to serve the unbanked
population.

Solutions:
@ Everus Wallet provides users with a secure facility to manage, send and receive digital currencies

without the requirement of lengthy application forms and credit score checks.
@ The expansion of Everus World ecosystem is set to open up a wide range of financial services to
Everus Wallet users globally, providing those considered to be unbanked with the ability to carry

out a wide range of day to day payments using digital currencies.

3. The security of cryptocurrency wallets

Along with the growth in cryptocurrency adoption by users across the world the market has also
experienced a rise in the number of hacks against cryptocurrency exchanges. As one of the main
factors affecting the growth, security is often mentioned as the number one concern by those who

are yet to participate in the trading of cryptocurrency.

The fear is growing strong in the market. And there are many cryptocurrency wallets that are not
100% safe especially for secure storage of large amounts of digital assets, exposing private key of a

user's wallet to hacks and threats.

Solutions:
@ Everus Multi-Crypto Wallet with multi-layered security features such as in-built facial recognition

and fingerprint scanning, Two-Factor Authentication and Google Authentication, offering users

an extra level of security.

4. Overcrowded cryptocurrency wallet marketplace

It is becoming increasingly difficult to choose a cryptocurrency wallet that is catered for every coin
and token in the market. They are mostly limited to a few numbers of coins and tokens. Thus, users
have to manage multiple cryptocurrency wallets for different digital assets as there isn’t a single

wallet to meet and support all cryptocurrencies for assets storage.

Solutions:
@ Storage of up to 100 supported cryptocurrencies inside Everus Multi-Crypto Wallet

@ To upgrade Everus Multi-Crypto Wallet to be able to store more coins and tokens each month,

with the ultimate goal of being able to hold over 500 different cryptocurrencies.

5. Difficulty in managing cryptocurrency portfolio

There are over 2,000 cryptocurrencies in the market with price movements happening every second
across global exchanges. This makes it difficult for users to track the real-time price and trading chart
of their digital assets one-by-one. In recent years, cryptocurrencies seem to have overcome the limita-

tions of fiat currencies as well.

Solutions:
@ Smart Wallet with live cryptocurrency price chart and alerts indication, highlighting and releasing

a warning to users on the price rise and fall

@ Smart Wallet with accounting tools and clear separation of spending and investing functions to facilitate
regulatory and compliance

@ Supplementary Wallets designed for sub-users (parents/organizations) with assigned authorization

and tracking of transactions

6. Limited usability for cryptocurrencies

There are many cryptocurrency providers in existence, and most are using it for buying and selling as
tradable items. Its usability is undervalued for utilization in regular manner in day-to-day life. In
specific parts of the world, cryptocurrencies are legal and regulated, for moving towards to become
an asset of real value in the real world.

Solutions:

@ EverMo platform allows offline merchants with the ability to accept cryptocurrency payments,

providing added usability to cryptocurrency users

6. Rationale for the Introduction of Everus

The current banking situation has not been optimal for inclusive commerce, and in many cases
prevented access to being able to do business, or to send or receive funds easily’*?*. With the new
technologies introducing decentralized finance services in the form of the blockchain and the
widespread adoption of Bitcoin® , Ethereum and the many altcoins that have followed‘, it is clear

that this is an exciting time for a change.

The founder and core team of Everus have a strong background in social messaging apps’ and in
managing active communities. Having seen this opportunity, they began to research the possibility

of developing a borderless currency for the unbanked.

Work on a non-blockchain prototype of Everus began in 2015, with a concept commercial ecosystem
using tokenized payments for transfers. Since then, the spectacular rise of cryptocurrency and
blockchain adoption worldwide, and the subsequent rapid appreciation in prices brought widespread

attention to the forerunners such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.

The exponential adoption of cryptocurrencies is currently occurring on a global scale; as adoption
further increases, people will naturally begin creating a new economy with these tools and start

spending cryptocurrency, as opposed to investing in it.

Throughout this journey - Everus will be strong spoke in the wheel, driving towards new horizons,

continually innovating and providing innovative fintech services to our customers.

On a greater stage, Everus will be working to help integrate its technology into helping solve

problems in disaster relief, military applications, financial education, wealth disparity, and governance.

Everus is borderless and knows no bounds, any financial transaction can be implemented with its
smart contracts support, and secure API - meaning marginalized economies in the emerging markets
can take full advantage and expand their operations in this rapidly evolving digital world.

8.2. Trullion-e (TRU-E) Token

Trullion-e (Tru-e)

For thousands of years, gold has been a crucial
store of wealth for people across the world,

performance that is on the most part
independent from stock and bonds.

Developed in partnership with some of the
leading banks and gold vaults in Europe,
Trullion-e (Tru-e) is the latest digital
cryptocurrency pegged 1:1 to the value of gold,
combining both the historical stability of gold,
with the modern efficiency of digital currency.

audits by leading global auditors with Daily
Asset & Custodian Statement available on

assets, the market value will be synchronized

pany, with certificates available for viewing via

9.2. EverusRemit

Global remittance is where someone working overseas transfers money to a person back in their
home country. Aside from international aid, global remittance makes up the largest amount of
foreign currency inflow to developing nations, and is key for jumpstarting their economies.
According to the World Bank estimates, remittance to low- and middle-income nations hit a record

US$466 billion in 20171.

The borderless and decentralized nature of cryptocurrency means it is not under the control of any
single entity or authority. As a global currency that cannot be modified or restricted in any way,
users are able to freely trade among one another, regardless of location, thanks to blockchain
technology. Everus Remit aims to leverage on blockchain to communicate with currency exchangers

worldwide, enabling the delivery of fiat currency to the doorstep of the beneficiary.

Nodes on the blockchain will verify and validate all transactions, ensuring the security and accuracy
of funds sent and received. Distributed ledger technology also allows transactions to be confirmed

in a short period of time for a very small cost.

Geo-tagging
Geo-tagging will allow users to quickly locate their nearest agent and vice-versa, making the process
more efficient and smooth. Agents will be able to deliver cash directly to the doorstep of the intended

recipient, making EverusRemit a complete end-to-end service.

This aims to replace current methods such as wire transfers, where the recipient is required to
physically be present and identify themselves before claiming the remitted funds. Agents will also
receive a commission for each successful delivery, with the ease of transaction ensuring that both

parties will be incentivized to use this service.

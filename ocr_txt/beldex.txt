EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

BELDEX: A HYBRID CRYPTOCURRENCY EXCHANGE

Beldex has created and is launching a hybrid cryptocurrency exchange that blends the best of
centralized and decentralized technology with high liquidity, excellent customer support and
private transactions for its users. Wlth a working alpha in production, the Beldex team is on
track for launch of the exchange in Q4 of 2019 Serving the APAC region at first, then expanding
throughout the world, Beldex fulfills a real market need for a user-friendly hybrid exchange
where people can trade in cryptocurrency and have a high level of utility for the token.

PROBLEM

The cryptocurrency market is dominated by difficult-to-use exchanges, coins that aren’t truly
private, and a lack of attention to the customer experience. One of the major Exchange,
Binance is dominating the market, increasing acting as a centralized entity that is trying to
monopolize the market. The recent advent of IEOs is a clear signal that exchanges are
beginning to act similarly to large financial institutions in concentrating power under one roof.
For people who are looking for more privacy and a great service, there’s a niche opening up.
Large investors will always get great care from whatever institution they use. But for medium
and small investors, those who want privacy of their transactions, and people without access to
banking, and people who want to have a one-stop-shop, there is a widening gap. The
opportunity to provide people with a full solution of wallet, exchange and a highly useful medium
of exchange is one that can transform communities.

MARKET

Transactions in cryptocurrency continues to increase and there’s a real market need to reach a
variety of investors. Furthermore, the number of coins on the market is increasing everyday, yet
many exchanges offer a small range of cryptocurrencies to trade. Especially when it comes to
niche markets, it’s becoming difficult for people to find one exchange where they can get high
liquidity and a large number of cryptocurrencies at reasonable fees. The cryptocurrency market
capitalization is more than $315 billion as of the writing of this whitepaper, and is predicted to
reach as much as $40 Trillion’.

Company: BELDEX

Beldex has been developing a privacy coin and an advanced hybrid Digital asset exchange for
the last year, and is releasing the full exchange in autumn 2019. The privacy coin has the
highest level of privacy available, as described in the technical section of this whitepaper.

Our company is devoted to providing a coin that is truly private, so that people can transact
safely and with no fear of who has their data and transaction information. The exchange and
wallet are designed as the first stage into the adoption of the privacy coin technology for those
people who want to participate in the new economy throughout the Asia Pacific region. The
exchange provides a full range of cryptocurrencies and utilizes both Beldex and other
cryptocurrencies for the exchange fees. The wallet is a multicurrency wallet that works in
partnership with both the exchange and online retailers who can accept the Beldex coin for their
services.

MIssION

BELDEX’ mission is to make it easy for a wide demographic of people to benefit from the
innovations that digital cash enables today. Our mission is to put cryptocurrency into the hands
of people who can benefit the most from using, and make it as easy to use as any other type of
exchange.

VISION

Beldex has the vision of becoming a one-stop-shop for a variety of financial services, making it
quick and easy for people and businesses to conduct transactions with cryptocurrency,
including trading and investing, with full privacy so that the users own their own data and are not
subject to the intrusion of governments or big businesses.

Coin TECHNOLOGY

The Beldex coin uses a variety of privacy technologies to ensure the maximum privacy for users
of the coin.

BELDEX COIN

Beldex is a mined proof-of-work token with masternodes as a mining opportunity to the
community. Originally a fork of Monero, Beldex has integrated PrivateSend privacy protocol
from DASH and few more key privacy features like ViewKey from ZEC to improve the original
privacy, as well as developing its own configurable privacy technology.

BELDEX’s core advantages

e Untraceable Roots - Like Monero which uses RingCT, Beldex too uses RingCT network
type but higher size of RingCT.

e Conditional Transactions - Transaction will be done only if the specified conditions are
met.

e Airdrop - If an individual, stake a certain amount of crypto in the wallet they get a specific
amount of interest in terms of the same coins. .

e Trustworthy - If owner reports fraudulence and the suspected receiver is unable to justify
the transaction, that particular transaction alone is revertible by the decision of the review
tribunal (Disputes are open to debate

The Beldex coin also provides the following benefits to the users of the Beldex coin:

Discounts on exchange fees.

Participation in on-chain voting.

Influence on innovation and development efforts.
Priority for listing coins on the Beldex exchange.
Purchase of goods and services within the Beldex partner network, as well as generic
cryptocurrency capabilities.

Access to market with large trading volumes.

Faster transaction processing.

Access to exclusive bonuses when offered.

Larger commissions in referral and affiliate programs.
Multilingual support.

Premiere access to new products and features.

Hashing Algorithm: Cryptonight Conceal

Elliptic curve: Curve25519

CryproNore ELEMENTS

Although a full-node incentive scheme could be implemented on top of any cryptocurrency,
Beldex uses the Monero source code because of the high level of privacy it affords to
transactions. Monero is an evolution on the CryptoNote protocol, which uses ring signatures,
stealth addresses, and RingCT, giving users the ability to sign transactions and obfuscate
amounts while maintaining plausible deniability.

For the Beldex ecosystem to maintain privacy, it is important to provide a medium of exchange
that underpins the internal economy and also minimise the risk of temporal analysis when
interactions occur across Beldex’s independent layers. For example, when engaging in
layer-one transactional services, users should never lose the privacy guarantees they receive
from the second-layer and vice versa.

Rinc SIGNATURES

Ring signatures work by constructing a ring of possible signers to a transaction where only one
of the signers is the actual sender. Beldex makes use of ring signatures to obfuscate the true
history of transaction outputs. Ring signatures will be mandatory for all Beldex transactions
(excluding block reward transactions), and uniquely, a fixed ring-size of ten is enforced on the
Beldex blockchain. This means that each input will spend from one of ten possible outputs,
including the true output.

STEALTH ADDRESS

Beldex makes use of stealth addresses to ensure that the true public key of the receiver is
never linked to their transaction. Every time a Beldex transaction is sent, a one-time stealth
address is created and the funds are sent to this address. Using a Diffie-Hellman key exchange,
the receiver of the transaction is able to calculate a private spend key for this stealth address,
thereby taking ownership of the funds without having to reveal their true public address. Stealth
addresses provide protection to receivers of transactions and are a core privacy feature in
Beldex.

RincCT

RingCT was first proposed by the Monero Research Lab as a way to obfuscate transaction
amounts. Current deployments of RingCT use range proofs, which leverage Pedersen

Cee TENT

Beldex Whitepaper — 9
commitments to prove that the amount of a transaction being sent is between 0 and 264 . This
range ensures that only non-negative amounts of currency are sent, without revealing the actual
amount sent in the transaction. Recently a number of cryptocurrencies have proposed
implementing bulletproofs as a replacement to traditional range proofs in RingCT because of the
significant reduction in transaction size. Beldex will utilise bulletproofs, reducing the information
that nodes are required to store and relay, thereby improving scalability.

Master Noves

Although Beldex implements novel changes on top of the CryptoNote protocol, much of
Beldex’s networking functionality and scalability is enabled by a set of incentivised nodes called
Master Nodes. To operate a Master Node, an operator time-locks a significant amount of Beldex
and provides a minimum level of bandwidth and storage to the network. In return for their
services, Beldex Master Node operators receive a portion of the block reward from each block.

The resulting network provides market-based resistance to Sybil attacks, addressing a range of
problems with existing mixnets and privacy-centric services. This resistance is based on supply
and demand interactions which help prevent single actors from having a large enough stake in
Beldex to have a significant negative impact on the second-layer privacy services Beldex
provides. DASH first theorised that Sybil attack resistant networks can be derived from
cryptoeconomics. As an attacker accumulates Beldex, the circulating supply decreases, in turn
applying demand-side pressure, driving the price of Beldex up. As this continues, it becomes
increasingly costly for additional Beldex to be purchased, making the attack prohibitively
expensive.

To achieve this economic protection, Beldex encourages the active suppression of the
circulating supply. In particular, the emissions curve and collateral requirements must be
designed to ensure enough circulating supply is locked and reasonable returns are provided for
operators to ensure Sybil attack resistance.

Bock REwaRD

Distribution of block rewards in Beldex is conducted through proof-of-work, a robust and well
studied system for the creation of blocks and the ordering of transactions. Miners collect and
write transactions into blocks and collect fees for doing so. As a consensus rule in Beldex, each
block contains multiple reward outputs of which only one goes to the miner. The Beldex block
reward is set to a constant value as 2 BDX.

Mining Reward: As well as collecting transaction fees, 10% of the block reward is awarded to
the miner that constructs the block.

Master Node Reward: The second output in each block (90% of total reward) goes to a Master
Node, or two Master Nodes if a relay is selected. Master Nodes are rewarded based on the time

Cee TENT

Beldex Whitepaper — 10
since they last received a reward (or time since they registered), with a preference for nodes
that have been waiting longer. Each time a Master Node registers with the network it assumes
the last position in the queue. If the Master Node maintains good service and is not ejected from
the queue by a swarm flag, it slowly migrates to the higher positions in the queue. Nodes at or
near the front of the queue are eligible for a reward, and once awarded, the node again drops to
the last position in the queue and begins working its way back up.

Beldex implements novel changes on top of the CryptoNote protocol (ASIC
Resistance, Dynamic Block Size & Ring Signatures), much of Beldex’s networking functionality
and scalability is enabled by a set of incentivised nodes called Master Nodes. To operate a
Master Node, an operator time-locks a_ significant amount of Beldex and provides a minimum
level of bandwidth and storage to the network. In return for their services, Beldex Master Node
operators receive a portion of the block reward from each block. The resulting network provides
market-based resistance to Sybil attacks.

VERIFIABLE COLLATERALISATION

Master Nodes must prove to the network that they are holding the required collateral. Privacy
features inherent in Beldex’s design make this difficult, specifically the inability to audit public
address balances or to use viewkeys to see outgoing transactions.

Beldex makes novel use of time-locked outputs, which allow Beldex coins to be time-locked until
the blockchain reaches a defined block-height. Until this defined height, the Beldex network will
invalidate attempts to spend these time-locked outputs. Beldex utilises this process to prove that
an amount is being held by a specific Master Node, preventing shuffling of collateral.

To register as a Master Node, an operator creates a time-locked output of the required amount
which unlocks after a minimum of 21,600 blocks have elapsed (approximately 30 days). In the
extra field of the transaction, the Master Node operator includes the Beldex address which may
receive Master Node rewards. This address will also be used as the public key for Master Node
operations such as swarm voting. Wallets may avoid using these Master Node registration
transactions as mixins, as their true amounts and destination are disclosed and therefore are
not useful in providing extra anonymity to a transaction.

Before each node joins the Master Node network, other nodes must individually validate that the
said nodes collateral outlay matches the required amount, as per the decreasing
collateralization requirement. Although collateral transactions expire after 30 days, the wallet will
have an opt-in automatic re-collateralisation feature.

CryproNote ALTERATIONS

As a cryptocurrency, Beldex is functionally similar to its fellow CryptoNote coins. However, there
are key differences beyond the addition of Master Nodes and the associated functionality that
comes with them.

ASIC RESISTANCE

An Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) is a computer chip that is built specifically for a
single function. In the context of mining, ASICs are used to compute for specific hashing
algorithms. They pose a risk to decentralisation because they outpace all other mining methods,
are manufactured by specific companies, have very limited distribution channels due to the
specialised nature of the hardware, and they require significant capital costs to develop and
operate profitably. There are potential benefits to ASICs, such as the capital cost requirements
that miners must undertake to invest in algorithm specific hardware which makes it less likely
that they would behave in a manner that undermines their own investment by acting
dishonestly. However, the distribution and manufacture of ASIC chips, with mature hashing
algorithms, is still centralised around a few large companies. These companies can refuse

Cee TENT

Beldex Whitepaper — 12
shipment to certain areas, decide what regions and customers get the best performing ASICs,
and they can structure limited runs and manipulate prices.

To prevent ASIC miners from monopolising the network hashrate, many cryptocurrencies
developed ASIC resistant hashing algorithms, like Scrypt and Ethash [25][26]. Until recently,
Monero used the CryptoNight hashing algorithm, which requires large amounts of L3 cache to
operate. In theory, this should have made it difficult to produce an ASIC chip due to large
memory requirements. However in 2018 Bitmain released the X3, a CryptoNight specific ASIC
that could effectively mine at ten times the speed of a graphics processing unit (GPU) [27].
Other hashing algorithms have suffered similar fates, with Scrypt, Ethash, and Equihash all now
being mined by ASICs.

To combat the use of ASICs, Monero proposed a strategy of hard forking every 3-6 months to
slightly change the CryptoNight hashing algorithm (the first fork moving to CryptoNightV7). The
capital and time required to build an ASIC is significant, and with highly specific hardware
designs, slight tweaks in a hashing algorithm should invalidate the chip design, wasting the time
and capital investment of ASIC manufacturers. However, this approach introduces its own
issues. If changes made to the algorithm are insufficient to prevent ASICs being reprogrammed,
then the network can become vulnerable to hashrate centralisation until another hard fork is
possible. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) should also 12 be considered in ASIC
resistance strategies, where infrequent, slight changes to hashing algorithms can be easily
reprogrammed for FPGAs. Another concern is that regular changes to core consensus
mechanisms introduce the chance of unintended bugs and generally centralise the development
of such changes around a core team of developers.

Beldex incorporated a version of CryptoNight called CryptoNight Conceal, which maintains
ASIC resistance against CryptoNight ASIC miners as well as cloud mining (like nicehash).
CryptoNight Heavy differs from CryptoNight V7 in a number of ways: it provides decrease in
scratchpad size to 512kb, and a change in the way implodes and explodes are handled. These
changes differentiate it from the largest target for ASIC miners which is Monero’s CryptoNight
V7 and also provide a more robust protection against ASIC development until a more
permanent solution is proposed.

Dynamic Block Size

Like other CryptoNote coins, Beldex does not have a fixed block size. Instead, the block size
changes over time, growing to include more transactions as the network reaches higher
transaction throughput. The Beldex block size scales by observing the median block size over
the last 100 blocks and slowly retargets the maximum size of any new blocks accordingly.

The long-term concern in other cryptocurrencies is that large block sizes burden the nodes that
store and verify transactions. As block sizes grow, nodes that run on lower grade hardware are
unable to process and propagate new blocks, leading to centralisation of the node network

Cee TETTDNnynmmmee=ceceeesc

Beldex Whitepaper — 13
among those with a commercial interest in maintaining nodes. This can be concerning because
distributing the blockchain across many nodes allows for the state of the chain to be confirmed
among many different parties, adding to its validity and censorship resistance.

In Beldex, a portion of the block reward is given to Master Nodes that process and propagate
blocks as full nodes. Because Master Nodes with insufficient bandwidth and performance are
dropped from the Master Node network, the reward pool self-enforces a minimum performance
requirement. This incentive structure not only ensures that the node count remains high, but that
the said nodes are of a sufficient performance level to successfully share blockchain data
across the network, irrespective of how large the blockchain grows or how demanding the
bandwidth requirements are. Even so, transaction size optimisations are still required to ensure
that the network scales efficiently so as to keep the Master Node operating costs down so that a
high node count can be sustained in the long term.

Ring Signature Size

Ring signatures are used to hide real outputs amongst others in any given transaction. The size
of a ring signature refers to how many mixins are used to construct the ring. Monero currently
has an enforced minimum ring signature size of seven, with six mixins used alongside the real
unspent output in a transaction.

The effect of larger ring-sizes has been sparsely studied, however, in paper 0001 (published by
the Monero Research Lab), the effect of differing ring-sizes was analysed versus an attacker
who owned a large number of outputs on the blockchain. It was found that higher ring-sizes
reduce the timeframe in which a malicious attacker who owned a large number of unspent
outputs would be able to perform effective analysis of transactions. Mandating larger ring-sizes
also protects against a theoretical attack known as an EABE/Knacc attack, where a third-party
(i.e. an exchange) can perform limited temporal analysis on transactions between two users.

Additionally, Monero has no maximum ring-size enforced by network consensus rules. Many
wallets like the Monero GUI wallet cap the ring-size at 26. However, a user is free to manually
create a transaction with whatever ring-size they wish, as long as it is above a ring-size of
seven. This is problematic since most wallets have a default ring-size of seven. Increasing a
transactions ring-size above seven makes it stand out. Further, if an individual's transactions
were to always use a non-standard ring-size in Monero (ten for example), a passive third-party
could analyse the blockchain and infer patterns using temporal analysis.

Beldex improves on both of these problems by statically enforcing ring-sizes, and setting the
ring-size to ten. Statically setting the maximum ring-size protects users who construct rings with
more than nine mixins and setting the ring-size minimum to ten more effectively prevents an
attacker who owns a large number of outputs from discerning the true outputs spent in a ring
signature. Larger ring-sizes also increase the default churning effectiveness non-linearly,
becoming more effective as ring-sizes grow.

Cee TETTDNnynmmmee=ceceeesc

Beldex Whitepaper — 14
In the current transaction scheme, increasing the ring-size to 10 would lead to a 2.6% increase
in the size of the transaction. However, when Bulletproofs are implemented it will account for
about a 8 - 13% increase in the size of a transaction. This is because of the overall reduction in
transaction size caused by Bulletproofs. Increasing the minimum ring-size may present a
problem on a network that lacks architecture to support larger sized transactions, due to the
increased overhead. With Beldex however, this burden can be carried by Master Nodes that are
incentivised to operate and provide sufficient bandwidth.

Al TECHNOLOGY
Beldex is collecting data to develop prediction algorithms to enhance the platform. These
future-driven developments will benefit all users of the platform.

e Security: Normative user behavior is tracked so that suspicious activity can be identified. As
user data is collected, the system knows how particular users typically transact and can
identify anomalies.

e Trading and prediction: Algorithms will be able to accurately track market movements and
provide algo-trading as well as hedging for the Beldex exchange itself, reducing the
custodianship risk that is sometimes associated with crypto exchanges.

CRrYPTOCURRENCY MARKET

Since the invention of Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency market has skyrocketed, both in value and
trading volume. Many market experts expect cryptocurrency to replace or outpace other types of
financial assets, because of the superior way in which tokens and cryptocurrencies can
represent value. Bitcoin is used as a hedge against other types of investments, creating a
balanced portfolio, because it appears that the cryptocurrency markets run counter to the
traditional investment and forex markets.

Transactions in cryptocurrency continues to increase and there’s a real market need to reach a
variety of investors. As shown by CoinMarketCap, while the market experienced a dip in 2018,
it is rapidly recovering.

THE STATE OF CRYPTO EXCHANGES TODAY

In the initial geographies, users are limited in the exchanges they use. In Malaysia, the leading
exchange is Luno, which offers no altcoins, only Bitcoin and Ethereum. While there are more
than 50 exchanges listed, only 2 of them list more than 10 tokens or coins. Despite crypto-friedly
regulation, the situation is quite limited when looking for a real trading platform for trading,
investment, and exchange. Furthermore, very few e commerce retailers have adopted the use
of cryptocurrency.

Digital cash provides a huge opportunity for the people in many regions. However, retailers and
online merchants have yet to adopt this form of currency over cash. Creating a user-friendly
ecosystem with a wallet, APIs for ecommerce providers, and an exchange including
peer-to-peer transactions will open up the opportunities. The layer of privacy on top of these
solutions is essential to adoption, as many people are looking at how they can have the
convenience and anonymity of cash in their transactions. For a variety of reasons, people don’t
want all of their transactions recorded by centralized companies and organizations without their
permission. Therefore, having a privacy coin is the key to adoption in a variety of markets.

Today, there are hundreds of crypto asset exchanges, and every week we hear about more of
them entering the market. However, the market is tremendously fragmented.

TRENDS IN MARKET

Markets are beginning to consolidate around the market leaders.
Market-specific options are needed for local languages and cultures.
The leading exchanges are offering IEO and serving the function traditionally filled by risk
insurers and financial corporations.

e IEOs and other services offered are further consolidating the market and squeezing smaller
exchanges.

e Fees for listing are becoming a barrier to entry for many new startups issuing tokens,
creating a market opportunity for niche exchanges.

e Hacks no longer make much of a difference in market leadership. In most recent hacks, the
trading platforms just covered the problem, similar to how banks operate. People are no
longer so worried about putting money on exchanges.

CHALLENGES

Currently the crypto/digital asset market faces a number of challenges addressed by BELDEX:

Individual privacy is not respected, and people have to trust their private details to a variety
of companies who may or may not respect their privacy.

Public legers mean all transactions can be traced, again violating people’s privacy. People
have the right to make private purchases and trades, and the current system does not
respect this.

Many exchanges feature a very limited number of cryptocurrencies to trade, and few
exchange pairs.

Exchanges do not have good customer service, and the use of the exchanges is difficult.
This causes user frustration, loss of funds and low adoption rates.

To use cryptocurrency, users need to use a variety of tools and vendors: wallet, exchange,
and coins. People can’t find all the services they need in one place.

Although regulation is in place to legalize crypto in many geographies, those markets are
underserved when it comes to user-friendly exchanges and wallets.

The crypto market is growing rapidly and it’s necessary to meet market demand with new
solutions.

Crypto exchanges today do not offer good support for the average customer. Support is
through email most commonly, which is highly problematic. In transactions where prices are
changing on a minute-by-minute basis, customers don’t want to wait a day for an email
exchange.

Liquidity is limited on exchanges because the exchange can only trade using the liquidity
from users on that specific exchange. Without integration to larger exchanges, it’s difficult to
guarantee that people will be able to trade in the currencies they want.

Cee TENT

Beldex Whitepaper — 19
SOLUTION

Beldex is releasing the Beldex hybrid exchange, which provides a very high level of security and
privacy to exchange users, focusing on APAC region.

Beldex is creating an ecosystem around the Beldex privacy coin and Beldex exchange to
ensure a financial system that benefits all participants. Users of the Beldex ecosystem will enjoy
the immediacy and privacy of cash, through electronic means. The Beldex ecosystem ensures a
high level of utility for the coins through a wide network of partners and commercial entities that
accept the Beldex coin.

The ecosystem includes:

e Beldex coin: A privacy coin based on the most advanced privacy protocols used by today’s
cryptocurrencies, ensuring user privacy, with configuration for greater levels of privacy.

e Beldex exchange: A hybrid centralized/decentralized exchange integrating privacy,
peer-to-peer trades, a wide range of coins and trading pairs, and integration with the Beldex
coin and wallet.

e Beldex wallet:

e Beldex commerce ecosystem: Integration with ecommerce partners for use of the Beldex
coin and wallet, as well as set of APls for integration of the wallet and coin for vendors
wishing to accept the Beldex cryptocurrency.

BELDEX EXCHANGE

The Beldex exchange is a hybrid centralized/decentralized exchange integrating privacy,
peer-to-peer trades, a wide range of coins and trading pairs, and integration with the Beldex
coin and wallet. The exchange itself is the result of more than a year’s development of the latest
technologies, taking the best from both centralized and decentralized technologies.

The benefits of our development efforts are in the unique features that Beldex can offer today as
well as the future developments that are planned in our roadmap. The exchange puts an
emphasis on:

e Huge selection of exchange currencies and exchange pairs. By connecting with large
exchanges, Beldex can offer the widest variety of trading crypto assets and pairings. Rather
than focusing on bringing in new coins, Beldex focused its attention on connectivity and
partnerships. Beldex will also be partnering with innovative projects to provide exchange of
assets not found in other exchanges.

e Liquidity of crypto assets. Rather than relying on exchange-specific asset trades, through
partnerships with other exchanges, Beldex allows liquidity at the market rate. This type of
decentralized trading combines the liquidity of all of the Beldex partner exchanges for a

Customer support. Beldex provides 24/7 human chat support. Rather than chatbots or email
responses, customers on the exchange can chat with a real person who will answer their
needs immediately. This level of support is a standard for all other market trading platforms,
but in the crypto space it’s a rarity. When it comes to money, people want real, immediate
answers, and Beldex provides that.

Privacy and security: Beldex uses a privacy coin that can be used for a variety of
transactions. All transactions in Beldex are completely private. Security will be through
biometric login for authentication assurance, and for the ease of login. Rather than having to
remember passwords and keys, and 2-factor authentication, people use their retina scan,
fingerprint. Not only is this more secure, but it’s much easier on people than other forms of
login.

Competitive transaction fees: The exchange will be focusing on volume and conservation of
operational costs in order to provide low fees for crypto asset transactions. Using the Beldex
token will provide additional fee discounts to users.

Instant Lending against your crypto asset in wallet system with minimal percentage of
interest fee and long terms pay back duration.

Stake your coins while holding your staking coins on our exchange you will be able to
receive proof-of-stake rewards for them. You can stake and exchange all in one place with
no delay.

FEATURES

The Beldex exchange includes a variety of features that make it particularly appealing to the
target market. Following are highlighted features, with more to be added in future versions.

ECHO TRADING

Echo trading is a way to allow new traders to experience the returns of seasoned traders. Using
echo trading, new traders can follow the movements of the top earners, buying and selling when
the experts do. The Beldex system follows the top traders in real time, and provides real-time
mimicking of the trades of the top traders. In return for sharing their data on trades, these
investors will receive rewards based on the returns from those who have chosen to mimic their
trades.

MARGIN TRADING

Users of the platform can borrow against their holdings from other lenders on the platform to do
margin trading. Margin trading of up to 200% will be allowed on the platform, allowing people to
leverage their capital as collateral for margin trading. It also provides return on investment for
the lenders of the capital. If the asset gains more than 200%, their positions are liquidated and
the loan is returned. Margin trading will be allowed against select assets only.

The Beldex exchange will include an API that can be used only by approved developers. The
API will allow integration of approved applications following code and security reviews, to
maintain the integrity and security of the platform.

The wallet includes multi-level security in it and its security code is unbreakable at any point.
The wallet only holds the information about the amount stored in it and the location where it is
stored is non-traceable. The Beldex wallet uses RingCT, which helps to mask the sender's
address.

BELDEX COMMERCE ECOSYSTEM

Beldex is building a network of partners online who will accept transactions in Beldex tokens,
and using the Beldex wallet for other cryptocurrency. The design of the system is to create an
easy way for both online and offline merchants to accept cryptocurrency, at a much lower cost
than credit card and other digital forms of payment today.

The Beldex team will create an easy-to-use plugin to existing Point of Sale systems in order to
allow brick-and-mortar merchants to accept the Beldex token as a form of payment. Initially, the
payment systems will support Beldex as well as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Payouts to merchants
will be in their local fiat currency, so they do not need to have any knowledge of how to trade in
crypto. Merchants and ecommerce partners can continue business as usual, but with the added
convenience of accepting cryptocurrency. The Beldex network will expand the utility for the
Beldex coin. Users experience the ease of digital cash with the privacy of cash when they
purchase services with the Beldex coin and wallet. Also, Beldex coin gives added advantage to
users as its a privacy coin.

BUSINESS MODEL
The Beldex system will gain revenues based on the following:

e Trading fees: Trading fees are the primary revenue stream for the Beldex exchange.
Beldex will work to offer the lowest possible trading fees, to make the exchange
appealing in a competitive market, and bring in a large volume of users. Traders using
Beldex tokens will get a 50% discount for using the Beldex token, increasing the
transaction volume of Beldex coins.

e Withdrawal fees: Withdrawal fees for both cryptocurrency and fiat currency will be
charged to platform users. A nominal charge will be added on top of the gas fees for
crypto transactions.

No fees will be charged for deposits to the Beldex exchange.

“Artificial intelligence system platform for future prediction based on
consensus, reward, responsibility, collective intelligence, argument, and bigdata”

GAPS is a platform to enable service for predicting event of future by continuous-
ly training artificial intelligence based on collective intelligence, that is training
with data generated through argument related with prediction.

The data related with prediction for training artificial intelligence is acquired
through argument of collective intelligence, whose start point is based on the
question that can be determined at future.

Here, the question that can be determined indicates that when the actual event
occurred after pre-defined predictable time, anyone can refer the data or answer
for that result using Oracle middleware provided by GAPS system. Also, we
assume that there is no error in data itself.

When the generator opens a channel for training with a question for prediction,
that question becomes a topic of the channel and participants of the channel
propose their opinion about prediction for given topic. Finally, they take issue by
joining to argument.

In this process, they may enhance the responsibility and reward for their opinion
by expressing their opinion several times. Also, the logically well-written opinion
receives the logic point, which is similar with recommendation in general commu-
nity, from other participants. In the opposite case, the opinion may lose its point.
According to the participation to the training, the point affects the reward and
responsibility after argument.

The training is completed when result is noticed after certain time that is deter-
mined at channel open and consensus is made. When any participant of channel

has objection about the result, the adjustment can be done through the poll.

Most of existing online communities are operated based on anonymity. This, of
course, has strong point but the side effect is not trivial.

Especially, the irresponsibility for own opinion due to anonymity is the major
cause. In addition, the opinion without responsibility is not worth as data at all.

To address this issues, GAPS platform resolves these problems through argument
and questions for all participants, as well as consequent responsibility and
rewards.

In GAPS platform, the responsibility and rewards are related with the success or
failure of artificial intelligence’s training. All of these processes are completely
automated by smart contract that runs on the decentralized platform. Conse-
quently, intervention at the middle of process or fabricating result is fundamental-
ly impossible.

Among these various features, the most distinguishable point compared with
other predictive platform is the virtuous cycle architecture that predicts not only
the possibility of the event but also the various reasons of that event using collec-
tive intelligence, trains the artificial intelligence with all of these data, and finally
enables the more accurate prediction.

In summary, GAPS platform is a system that gradually trains the artificial intelli-
gence through collective intelligence’s arguments for prediction, where various
opinions themselves improve the accuracy of prediction, and provides the predic-
tion of artificial intelligence trained above certain threshold as service for the
participants who need it.

Necessity

“Who predicts the future controls the current”
Predictive system indicates a system to predict the event of future or unknown
event using various technology such as modeling, machine learning, and data

mining with the facts of current and past.

Among such predictive systems, artificial intelligence-based bigdata analysis is the
most distinguished technology.

GAPS 04
By using the artificial intelligence, one may analyze a huge amount of data
generated from various source and use it efficiently to produce a creative and new
value.

Therefore, along with block chain, the bigdata analysis based on artificial
intelligence stands out among technology of the fourth industrial revolution.

Problems

“One man sows and another man reaps.”

“Every word and action imply a responsibility.”

However, although it is essential technology, there are several problems as
follows.

I. Problem due to centralization

The most intuitive problem is a problem due to centralized system.

Only major companies who have platform for gathering massive data can collect
the bigdata required for predictive artificial intelligence system.

However, that data is not validated, and in most cases, the data provider are not
responsible for the data. Moreover, the platform operators may manipulate the
database as they want. Hence, the artificial intelligence’s prediction with such data
is likely to be inaccurate or biased.

Also, even assume that the prediction result is correct, the right of that result
completely belong to the company.

This is ironic, because no reward is given to the platform users who generate and
provide data required for prediction.

GAPS 05
II. Solution with decentralization but
misunderstanding about prediction system

Another problem is project related with biased prediction.

Recently, various projects related with decentralized prediction are launched to
solve the problem due to centralized predictive system, but most of them are
limited to the prediction market.

Of course, they solve several problems of previous centralized prediction market,
but other problems occur such as user's inconvenience, slow speed from opening
the market to balancing account, and illegalization issue.

Moreover, the problem and limitation of these prediction market is that after
result of prediction for certain event comes out, only balancing account between
persons with correct and incorrect prediction is made. The event and related
prediction data are not used to other field and it is not helpful at all for predicting
next similar events.

Due to these reasons, people often misunderstand the system as a betting system
where only name is different.

In this situation, more troubling is making people misunderstand the predictive
system. For most of people, the project related with prediction reminds them of
one in prediction market. Therefore, they cannot recognize the real meaning of
predictive system, as described above, “assume for the event of future in advance
based on the past and current data”.

GAPS Platform

GAPS platform is a artificial intelligence prediction system to enable predictions
about various results at the future which people wonder by solving these prob-
lems and misunderstanding, and consequently help people to select correction
answer for given problem using these predictions.

GAPS 06
Solution

“Anonymity, irresponsibility, swearing, useless data, and waste

vs
rewards, responsibility, argument with collective intelligence, and training
with agreement”

GAPS solves these problems by using several tools as follows.

I. Beginning of all training, question and training channel

All trainings begin from the question that requires prediction. Here, the question
should be about the event of future and its answer always must be determined.

In GAPS platform, a participant who opens the channel with the question that is
beginning of training is called as creator.

When the creator specify the question for prediction, staking the GAPS coin that
undertakes the responsibility of the training channel, and input the expiration time
of argument and source information of oracle data to collect the result of predic-
tion, the training channel is opened and other participants can join. The number
of participants of channel is proportional to the amount of staked GPAS coin.

To make a greater number of collective intelligence join to the argument for more
accurate prediction and training, greater responsibility is also required, hence
more GAPS coin should be staked.

When training of artificial intelligence is completed through argument of partici-
pants after opening the channel, the creator receives awards for successful partici-
pation of artificial intelligence’s training by redistributing GAPS coin which is
staked when opening the channel.

If the number of actual participants are under 10% of the number of available

participants that is determined at the opening after certain time, that channel is
closed automatically.

II. Collective intelligence

It means that the integrated intelligence of group with variety and independence
is more likely to be close to correct answer compared with the ability of a few
superior persons or experts.

We focused on the keywords of variety and integrated, hence we decide to collect
the data about cause and reason for the result through argument, not simple
prediction data of result for various and rich data required for artificial intelli-
gence’s training.

Ill. Argument

This is a process where training channel's participants with different selection
come up against each other about prediction.

Participants who select correct prediction and proposed opinion related with it
receives the rewards for helping the training. However, the others who fail for
prediction cannot receive award and their GAPS coin, a substitute of responsibility,
is redistributed to the creator and successful participants with certain ratio.

This distribution policy is explained by the POW (Proof Of Work), one of the con-
sensus algorithm of block chain, where all participants of argument are same as
node for mining and similar with providing computing power for mining, partici-
pants should provide staking coin for responsibility of their opinion. Also, as
reward is given after solving the problem, only participants success with training
win rewards after argument.

Due to above reason, the consensus algorithm of GAPS platform is named as POD
(Proof of Discussion for Learning), meaning that all consensus are made through

the training with argument.

Also, one may receive or lose logic points from the participant who selects the
same prediction. According to the logic points, reward becomes greater or less.

GAPS 038
IV. Oracle

The question about prediction that becomes topic of training channel is limited to
the one where its answer is always be determined after certain period of time.
Hence, it is necessary to get the prediction result from outside of chain. The prob-
lem during this process is called as Oracle problem. We also tried to solve this
problem by responsibility and rewards.

Artificial intelligence system trained in the GAPS platform focuses on solving the
prediction problem for the specific range of events. Here, the specific range of
events indicate that the events where anyone can figure out its result accurately
after certain period of time. For example, exchange rate, stock price, coin price,
result of match, election result, and weather belong to that events.

Various oracle data about specific event is provided as middleware from the
platform, and when the actual result of specific event comes out after pre-defined
time, the creator can acquire the data to the own channel.

At this point, to prevent wrong result notice due to mistake or on purpose, partici-
pants of channel can claim for the result for certain period of time after result
announcement. However, when claiming, the data for rebuttal and its accurate
source should be provided as well.

When the claiming starts, new question to solve that situation is newly created
and the coin is redistributed according to the poll result. At this point, when the
creator receives less votes, the final training fails and the coin staked at the open-
ing the channel is distributed to the participant who completes the training by
input correct notice after claiming.

To prevent this problem, the creator always concerns about result announcement,
and GAPS platform solves the oracle problem by these responsibility and rewards.

V. Blockchain (Decentralization, Responsibility,
Reward, Consensus, and Smart Contract)

GAPS platform is a system to solve the problems of centralized system and irre-
sponsibility due to anonymity of general community, and automatically process all
jobs through smart contractor, without any intervention, in training artificial intelli-
gence with argument of truthless participants for collecting responsible opinions
of collective intelligence.

The most appropriate technology to implement this system is block chain-based
technology. Especially, we solved all of these issues by using responsibility and
reward of each participants for eco system, POD consensus algorithm, and coin
economy.

VI. Artificial intelligence with machine learning

The final goal of GAPS platform is to find out the prediction-based data that
causes the resulting number, not to merely predict the number. In addition, GAPS
aims to generate new predictive system that is not possible previously by combin-
ing the artificial intelligence training with prediction-based data and existing
trained artificial intelligence.

Specifically, we try to make virtuous cycle as question - argument based on pre-
diction - consensus - training - artificial intelligence’s prediction - argument
based on prediction...

In the beginning of the service, the depth of training data should be grown first by
limiting the topic of training as a few most interesting topics. However, as the
number of participants to eco system increases as well as various topic and data
are generated accordingly, we expect that the field and contents required to be
predicted using artificial intelligence will be extended exponentially.

NO
The process of GAPS platform begins from the creator's question. The channel is
created from the question, followed by argument with participants, announce-
ment of result for question, consensus, and training.

The creator's question for opening the training(argument) channel is limited to
the questions where its result can be referred by oracle middleware in GAPS
platform and is no doubtful. Also, by staking the creator's GAPS coin, the respon-
sibility of question, channel, and result of later is undertaken. The amount of
staked GAPS coin determines the scale of channel to create.

For the question which requires argument with a large number of participants, if
the creator does not has enough coin, the channel can be created by a group of
creators. In this case, after completing training, the coin is distributed to each
creator according to their staked coin.

If the number of actual participants is much less than the number of available
participants after generating channel, that channel is closed automatically.

After channel is generated, the participants can contribute the basis of prediction
to the side where they believe by uploading their opinion with staking coin ,the
responsibility of system training. At this point, the upload can be done several
times to emphasize the confidence of own prediction, and it leads greater rewards
after training successes.

Good prediction can receive logic points, and it may lose them in the other hand.
When training successes after argument, the prediction with higher logic points
win greater rewards proportional to the points.

When the creator announces the result value after expiration time of argument
using the oracle middleware provided by system, training process is conducted
following POD, and all process about that channel is finished. If the creator notices
wrong result during this process, any participant can claim to the result with
correct oracle data, then the result of the creator and claimer are judged by votes
of other participants.

For such process, when consensus is made, staked coin is redistributed according
to each responsibility and reward logic.

GAPS 12
Lastly, when the result for the creator's question is announced without any issues
after all training processes, the opinions of successful participants are transformed
to the data for artificial intelligence’s training and then the training is performed.
The opinions of the others are excluded from the training.

Staked coins, a substitute of responsibility for all participants in argument, is
redistributed to the creator who made channel for training and the participants
who are helpful for training by successful prediction as rewards with pre-defined
ratio.

]. Background

Today, when an individual or enterprise is performing computing tasks that require high-performance computing
resources, they rely on centralized cloud computing service providers such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, IBM, etc.,
(such as a closed-in network, proprietary billing policies, and a way to allocate premeditated resources) or
separately purchase and use expensive, high-performance workstation computers. In particular, the scientific and
industrial worlds that are implementing big data applications or developing machine learning models are increasing
the demand for high-performance computing power to run large amounts of applications and process large

amounts of data.

In recent years, however, personal computers with remarkably high performance have been continuously
introduced due to rapid technological advancement, and big data analysis and machine learning have become
possible on personal computers. However, most of the work done with these high-performance computers is
usually in the form of Internet browsing, simple documentation and computer games, and most personal computer

resources are idle.

Therefore, we believe that we need a new form of distributed computing platform that recognizes this problem

and utilizes the resources of many personal computers to enable high-performance computing at low cost.
CONUN Distributed Supercomputing Platform

On the other hand, we are seeing new technologies that provide a new approach to running distributed
applications such as Ethereum. In particular, Ethereum enables developers to create smart contracts that run in the
structure of a block-chain. It creates many use cases for designing and implementing services such as forecasting

markets, cloud funding, web hosting, general contracts, financial services, and distributed data processing.

Based on these advanced technologies, we developed a platform for building a horizontally distributed desktop
computing system where projects (applications) that require high-performance computing resources can be
performed at low cost by sharing idle processing resources of personal computers, through this way, we will create
an open structure that shares the distributed computing power through interpersonal interaction without
proprietary intermediaries, and build an ecosystem that enables individuals to earn money according to the

contribution of the participants.

Furthermore, we are noticing that smartphones are getting more powerful and perform better than previous high-

end workstations, and are becoming more popular than PCs worldwide, we want to build platform that includes

smartphone's computing performance as ad-hoc cluster in our distributed computing network.

2. Introduction

CONUN is a platform for building a horizontally distributed desktop computing system that can share the idle

processing resources of personal com
computing resources. The platform inc!

that individuals carry.

CONUN connects a personal computer
of an application that requires high

computer of the person or group (the “

puters to handle multiple projects (tasks) that require high performance

udes not only personal computers but also the resources of smartphones

‘© a peer-to-peer (P2P) network from the Internet, the owner ("Requestor")

performance computing power leases some compute power from the

Provider") that wants to share their computing resources. This configuration

can be useful for projects that typically require large amounts of work and long processing times.

CONUN implements a method for or}

ganizing the necessary processes from the requestor's applications and

effectively executing them on distributed computing resources. This approach replaces costly cloud computing

services, reducing computing time and making complex applications such as scientific calculations and machine

learning easier to use at lower cost.

CONUN does not have to pay for usi

ng existing cloud computing because it builds high computing power by

collecting and sharing resources of personal desktop computers. In addition, because of the distributed computing

architecture, certain groups do not have a single control authority to monopolize and regulate resources.
CONUN Distributed Supercomputing Platform

We will use our own tokens based on the Ethereum block-chain to provide value to distributed desktop computing
to requesters and suppliers and investors participating in the platform to operate the platform ecosystem. . The
token acts as a payment medium for processing the distributed computing services of the platform ecosystem. The
requester and the supplier can use tokens to compensate for the use of computer resources. This means that a
person who requires high performance computing power can pay using tokens to solve their computing
performance problems, and a provider connected to the Internet can directly benefit from providing their

computing resources.
Therefore, CONUN provides a horizontal distributed computing power sharing platform in which both a computing
resource provider and all application requesters and operators that require that computing power are free to

participate, we are also confident that CONUN will build a future-oriented computing power-sharing ecosystem by

providing a crypto-currency for all participants to conveniently trade.

3.1 Foundation, Vision, Goal

n recent years, we know from many sources that there is a growing demand for high-performance computing
applications such as high-level applications such as scientific calculations and deep learning of artificial intelligence,
and high-performance computing power to handle big data.

However, a common way to accommodate these needs is to utilize cloud computing services or build and use their

own high-performance computer infrastructure.

n particular, the infrastructure of high-performance computers is complex and expensive, requiring expertise to
operate them and separate human resources for management operations. In particular, the infrastructure of high-
performance computers is complex and expensive, requiring expertise to operate them and separate human

resources for management operations. In addition, traditional cloud computing is a closed-network, proprietary

billing policy, and a pre-planned allocation of resources that cannot be deployed in a fully distributed infrastructure.

To solve these problems, we need to implement a breakthrough distributed computing resource sharing
architecture that enables computing resource management and lowers computer infrastructure costs by using

blockchain technology. Our system uses blockchain driven distributed applications (DApps) to automatically

discover and deploy applications, data and compute processes, and costs to assist with the proper computing

resources. Distributed application approach is now widely used, reliable and flexible enough to reduce the time and

cost of implementing a block-chain platform.
CONUN Distributed Supercomputing Platform

Distributed Computing is a distributed processing model that takes advantage of the processing power of multiple
computers connected to the Internet to solve huge computational problems. Distributed computing can take
advantage of multiple computer networks, each performing part of an overall task to get results much faster than
using one computer. The idea to utilize the processing resources of these idle personal computers appeared when
ARPANET, also known as the introduction of the Internet, appeared in the early 1970s. In overseas, projects are
being carried out on various applications such as bio, weather, artificial intelligence, mathematics, and cryptography.
We refer to projects such as SETI @ Home, distributed.net, Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing

(BOINC), and Folding @ home. These projects are being conducted by nonprofit organizations to run large parallel

applications at low cost using idle computing resources through desktop computers.

CONUN Distributed Supercomputing Platform

We also develop a model for distributed computing processing using personal computers by referring to desktop
grid computing technology and we will use the solution as a base architecture to build an infrastructure that shares

computing resources across existing high-performance workstation and personal desktop computers.

Grid computing is a distributed architecture that tries to build a virtual supercomputer by combining the
computational power of many computers to solve complex problems such as high computation and high capacity
processing. In a grid computing model, a server or personal computer runs independent tasks and is connected to
the Internet or a network, however, in distributed computing different systems within the same network share one

or more resources.

The advantage of grid computing is that it provides transparent access to resources to improve user productivity
so that tasks can be completed more quickly and it also supports scalability and flexibility to deliver compute power
where it's needed most, allowing the grid to seamlessly scale over time, consolidating thousands of processors into

a single cluster.

We refer to the Desktop Grid open source platform (XtremWeb), which can apply the technology of grid computing
to desktop computers. This open source platform is designed to build your own grid based on a voluntary resource
PC on a desktop PC, university, enterprise or Internet and XtremWeb development is also used in scientific

calculations and high-level application processing based on Desktop Grid, Global Computing and Peer-To-Peer

distributed systems. Like other large-scale distributed systems, the platform uses remote resources (PCs,

workstations, and servers) connected to the Internet and uses internal network pools (LAN, PC, workstation, server)

to enable participants on the platform to collaborate by providing their idle computing resources.
CONUN Distributed Supercomputing Platform

We will look at the possibilities of using mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets in grid computing/
distributed computing, and we will configure how to apply the above technologies to mobile devices. The
performance of the latest smartphones is growing fast and steadily, and the fact that they are always on will be a

major reason for making smartphones a distributed computing platform.

n general, distributed applications must be abstract enough from the underlying platform to target different
mobile platforms and different network topologies. The deployment work will be to implement platform-specific

algorithm efficiencies and create different versions for each platform so that they can be performed in cross-

platform technologies such as Java using abstracted virtual machines. In order to efficiently deploy work to multiple
mobile devices and use it as a computing node, we will develop our system with reference to the University of
Amsterdam's Java-based open source high performance distributed computing platform, University of Virginia

OGSI.NET, Architecture and technology framework already developed and in use, and BOINC, and Folding@Home

mobile platforms as well.

CONUN Distributed Supercomputing Platform

CONUN allows the requester to run the application on the computer that joined the platform. Workers connected
to the Internet simply create an environment where they can automatically participate in the project after
downloading and installing the executable program and registering the account. This program uses only idle time

on your computer, so you can adjust it to have a minimal impact on your actual computer usage.

CONUN will support devices that can provide more value to multiple platform participants to handle block-chain
computing resources at a lower cost. To do this, we disclose supplier reliability so that suppliers can provide
services transparently and in order to ensure a high level of service, it will be designed so that appropriate
compensation can be achieved through transparent quality control according to the contribution of various

suppliers and requesters.

3.2 Architecture

We will design a computing node that controls the components of the personal computer, such as CPU, GPU,
memory, and storage, and configure the way that each node is modularized to process the application. Each node
is operated in a virtual machine environment and is implemented so that it can run separately from the operating
system of the computer based on the container operation method of Docker. And storage devices (disk drives)
that store application data will be implemented with reference to distributed data storage solutions such as IPFS,
Storj, and Sia, etc. The computers of each node can be run by remotely downloading and storing applications and

data for service operations.

CONUN configures each node's computers to operate on a horizontally distributed network. This means that there
is no centralized control over the aggregation of nodes. As the concept of the block-chain implies, each node will

autonomously access the service and configure the platform ecosystem while controlling its own process control.

CONUN implements a separate resource scheduling algorithm that can manage multiple resources so that
applications can be reliably and efficiently processed on multiple computer nodes.
This will essentially be a complex program model that can handle the security, management, and restoration of

data.

3.3 Application of Blockchain Technologies

The blockchain is designed based on cryptographic algorithms such as existing public and private keys on a P2P-
based horizontal network, and a distributed ledger technology, provides a way to maintain the integrity of the
books by verifying the trustworthiness of the transactions by the consensus of the participants without an

administrator.

CONUN is implemented using block chaining technology to record all metadata related to computing power
requestor's application processing and to manage work transaction through it. This provides a consistent and

reliable environment because none of the contributors to the work can arbitrarily manipulate their work.
In addition, CONUN develops its own tokens based on the Ethereum blockchain in terms of providing value to

distributed computing for users and investors, it is used by providers and requesters to compensate for application

and computing resource usage as a media role for platform participants to request and exchange services.

16
CONUN Distributed Supercomputing Platform

3.4 Application Case

We understand the benefits and needs of distributed computing systems. Rather than processing the resources
required by users from one computer to another, it is important to be able to process these distributed computers
faster and more efficiently. This makes it possible to use an environment with high computation speed, easy
system expandability, high availability and reliability; best of all, you can take advantage of the price-performance

benefits.

This environment can be used to perform more common tasks as well as existing special scientific computing

projects.

1. Ascientific calculation project
CONUN can be used to perform scientific computing tasks that require complex and fast computing
performance. In general, scientific calculations are mainly used to understand mathematical models
using computers and to understand the research subjects and to derive results. For example, there are
areas of academic research such as physics, biology, and chemical informatics, or social research
purposes such as drug development, social statistics, climate prediction, and cryptanalysis, all of which

require large-scale computing capabilities.

2. Deep Learning Model project
In recent years, deep learning has been one of the most active and rapidly evolving fields of artificial
intelligence and machine learning. We have seen the need for a large-scale computing infrastructure to
develop and implement a deep learning model, as we have seen in the case of AlphaGo. CONUN uses
this distributed computing power to implement a multi-process environment capable of learning deep

learning algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), circular neural networks (RNN),

reinforcement learning, and used to quickly create a user-designed deep-running model. We are also
considering developing a solution (API) to enable Tensorflow, Theano, and Caffe, which are currently

active used deep-learning frameworks, in our distributed computing environment.

Big Data Analysis project

Big Data is a technology that extracts value from data, including large amounts of structured or

unstructured data sets beyond the capabilities of existing database management tools, and analyzes

and predicts results. Big Data has been highlighted for several years because of its potential to provide

valuable information across all areas such as politics, society, economy, culture, and science and

technology.

This requires a computing infrastructure that quickly computes and processes large amounts of data,

such as in the case of deep learning. Most big data analysis techniques and methods are data mining,

only in university research institutes but also in bio industry. For this research, distributed computing

environment will become an essential computing infrastructure.

A Blockchain Token

CONUN uses its own tokens based on the Ethel

reum blockchain in terms of providing value to distributed

computing for users and investors. The token acts as a medium for platform participants to request and exchange

services for processing. Tokens are used by providers and requesters to compensate for application and computer

resource usage. Tokens are also required to process other processes after the application registry and transaction

framework is implemented.

As mentioned in the application examples, almost any application requiring high capacity / high performance

computing power, such as scientific calculation, deep learning, and big data analysis, can use the CONUN platform

to handle their projects. Any person or organizatio

hereum blockchain. The design of the token follows the token

aces, and the creation of the CONUN token is performed using

the Ethereum smart contract feature. Applicants wishing to participate in the CONUN platform may purchase and

retain tokens during pre-sale or cloud funding periods.

We will proceed with token pre-sale and provide tokens to the participants first.

Tokens supplied via pre-sales are converted to CONUN default tokens safely after ICO.

5. Development Roadmap

We plan to develop a step-by-step plan to build a horizontally distributed desktop computing system platform.
CONUN would be a highly complex project as it would require the development of a newly constructed

architecture based on the currently developed open-source solution.
We will add and distribute newly configured functions at every stage of development, and will initially test network

services to test the project. Initial work is done independently of the ICO and may be faster, depending on the level

of ICO in the future.
a Phase 1: Platform Development (Late 2018)

6. Safety and Security

A distributed computing environment is a complex structure that allows remote access to computing resources
such as desktop computers, mobile devices, and workstations over the Internet. These environments, as well as

others, can be exposed to security risks from malicious threats.

We know that we have to do risk management. This means that every activity on the CONUN platform must create
a responsible security culture that can be done safely and transparently. This is to ensure that the computers of
individual computing resource providers are secure and that the data and information of application users are

protected by security threats.

We will design and operate systems to implement anti-fraud policies and systems for risk management and to
protect systems from malicious hackers. This is accomplished by properly performing security policies,
authorization and authentication operations that can detect, disassociate, block, and exit dishonest nodes from al

nodes participating in the platform and keep private information private.

The security system basically applies password-based authentication & authentication systems that operate based
on password-based authentication and tickets to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of data processed in the

platform, and apply VO Level Systems, which provides integrated authorization services for virtual organizations,

and Resource Level Systems authentication system, to grant access to resource sets. And in the execution area o
the application, it will protect the user area by implementing a safe and isolated execution environment based on

the sandboxed virtual system.

takes a lot of steps to provide a secure, distributed computing environment for users, and building an

environment where trusted external applications can run on desktop computers is a very important part. We are

deeply aware of the importance of safety and security that we are concerned with and we will continue our

research and development efforts regardless of each stage of development.

23
CONUN Distributed Supercomputing Platform

7. Blockchain Token

Our core service area will be a horizontally distributed desktop computing system platform that will serve the
ecosystem to perform all applications requiring high performance computing at low cost, as shown in our
application examples. We are also planning a related service that will enable us to create a second added value by

leveraging our CONUN platform.

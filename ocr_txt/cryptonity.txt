INTRODUCTION: WHY CRYPTONITY?

Building a cryptocurrency exchange is not an easy task. Building an exchange that provides

a complete set of tools and features is an even more challenging ambition. At Cryptonity, we
are conscious of the time, self-investment, passion and hard work a project like this demands.
But we do believe that the current exchanges, including those who have been in the market
for a long time, can be improved in a lot of ways. Perfection is very hard to reach, but we strive
to get close to it, as much as we can.

Based on our experiences in cryptocurrency as traders and miners who have been active users
of current platforms, we do believe that we have the knowledge and the skills needed to build
the cryptocurrency exchange you've been waiting for.

We also believe that in an exchange project, as for any other business, the customer is the king,
and should be treated as a king, or a queen. Our users/customers are the ones who use our tools,
trust to keep their money safe, and thus help us build our reputation and credibility in the market.
So they deserve to be listened to and to be treated with care.

That philosophy is the very root of our project. Cryptonity is the combination of Crypto and
Community. It’s simple but strong and meaningful, as our goal is to be an exchange that is
respected by the Cryptocurrency Community.

PROBLEMS ON CURRENT EXCHANGES

From our point of view, we see two different categories of cryptocurrency exchanges: the big
players on the one hand, and the challengers on the other hand.

The ones we subjectively call the challengers do not care about their users or customers, and

seem not worried about their credibility. The majority of them list all coins who accept to pay their
expensive fees, and that’s it. They don’t interact with their customers, don’t make any improvements
(such as UI upgrades), and only focus on maximising their incomes. They are very often not
transparent at a point which it is, sometimes, for us, hard to understand how some users can trust
them and engage their money on those exchanges. We think that it’s because some “low cap” alt
coins are only available on those exchanges.

Regarding the big players, we also have a lot of questions. Are they real companies? Are they
regulated? Do they have plans to support FIAT? Do they have any bank account? Where are they
based? Are their platforms really safe? Is there any insurance in case our money is stolen? Can we
talk to someone in a live chat? Can we call them in case of emergency? And the list goes on. At the
end of the day, it’s all related to security and transparency issues. It’s actually even worse for big
players as they are the main target for hackers and thieves.

We could write a book about cryptocurrency exchange related problems, and the ones stated
above are only a few among a very long list of things the market can do better. In the same time,
we understand that running an exchange involves many challenges and risks. Aside security and
transparency issues, we have also noticed issues related to user experience, such as lack of trading
tools, insufficient language support, slow withdrawal processes, etc.

CRYPTONITY SOLUTIONS

At Cryptonity, we aim at providing the most comprehensive, secure, transparent and collaborative
exchange platform in the market.

One of the key aspect of our project is security. We want to provide to our users the most secure
trading platform. To achieve that goal, we will work with the best known security experts in the
market, be audited twice a year by independent security companies, and communicate our audit
results to all of our users. Our security partners will be mentioned on our website. To go further in
guaranteeing our users the safest trading experience, we will setup an insurance policy to refund
our users in case of losses, due to an attack. You will find more details about our insurance policy
below, in the Exchange Principles section.

The other very important aspect is the collaborative interaction with our users. It is more than
natural for us to involve our users in the evolution of our platform. We will have various
communication channels open to interact with our users and we will make sure to respond to our
users’ requests as promptly as possible. We want our community to get involved in the evolution of
the platform, in terms of features to be developed, coins to be listed, and so on. A “Feature Request”
function will be implemented for users to submit the features they would like to see on the platform.

Last but not least, we will put all our efforts to provide our users with a comprehensive and
ergonomic set of trading tools, including a large number of languages. We invite you to learn about
the main features Cryptonity will provide. Community feedbacks about those features are more than
welcome !
CRYPTONITY TOKEN (XNY)

TOKEN SPECIFICATIONS

We will issue our own token, called Cryptonity Token, with the ticker XNY.

Our Cryptonity Token will run natively off the Ethereum Blockchain. We are planning to develop
our own Blockchain in the near future and we will start working on it right after our Token Sale
is finalised.

We will issue a fixed amount of 1OOM (one hundred million) Cryptonity Tokens. We will never
increase that amount or repurchase our Tokens. Manipulating our token such as decreasing the
total supply to create deflation is against our ethical policy and the worst way to gain respect from
the community, the traditional market and the regulators. We do not want to use practices that
contribute to give a bad image to a crypto market that surely doesn’t need that.

Cryptonity Token will be a utility token and its price shall thus be related to its utility. Our token
will grant its owners a lifetime discount of 50% on Cryptonity Exchange fees. It will also enable its
owners to take part to specific features such as the vote for the “Coin of the Month”. Find out more
details about our fees in the “Economic Scheme” section.

CRYPTONITY EXCHANGE PRINCIPLES

DEVICE COVERAGE

To ensure to our customers the most convenient trading experience on any device, we will
develop the following interfaces:

@ Web-based trading client

@ Android and iOS native client

@ Mobile HTMLS5 native client

@ REST API

MULTILINGUAL SUPPORT

At the initial launch, 4 languages will be supported on Cryptonity Exchange: English, French,
Chinese and Korean. As we intend to provide the most comfortable experience to our users,
we will add over time all relevant languages requested by our users.

TRADING PAIRS
At the initial launch, Cryptonity Exchange will support trading pairs in the following coins:

@ Bitcoin (BTC)

@ Ethereum (ETH)

@ Crytonity Token (XNY, will be available once our ICO is finished)
@ Tether (USDT)

We plan to support FIAT currencies as trading pairs, we will do our best to have it implemented
as soon as possible.
ECONOMIC SCHEME

This section details the fees applicable on our Exchange. All fees will always be accessible and
fully detailed for all of our users. No hidden fees.

@ Exchange/Trading fees: 0.1% per trade.
@ Withdrawal fees: between 0.2% and 0.5%, with variations between coins/tokens.
@ Other fees: in case other fees apply, we commit to let our users Know about them, in detail.

COINS AND LISTING POLICY

Cryptonity will charge a fixed fee to be listed on our platform. But we keep the right to select

coins who strictly respect our criteria of selection, which is based on: liquidity, community support,
user base, use case and credibility, including “low market cap” coins if their meet our criteria and
get support from the community. In case we are not sure about some coins, we will solicit
community feedback. We will also enable the community to suggest coins through our

“Coin Request” feature.

Beside the listing policy stated above, we will also submit to our users a list of coins that respect
our criteria for them to choose one as the “Coin of the Month’, which will be listed on our platform.
Each user can vote for the “Coin of the Month” by using his/her XNY Cryptonity Tokens (cost to be
confirmed). More details will be available on Cryptonity Exchange.

CRYPTONITY BLOCKCHAIN

We plan to develop and launch our own Blockchain. We will start working on it as soon as our ICO
finishes, and we will keep our community updated with the progress. Community involvement
will be key and a huge help for us.

DECENTRALISED EXCHANGE

Our plan is to build a decentralised exchange in the future, and we want to do it with the
participation of the community. That’s why we will launch a “code-a-thon” program, in which the
best implementation(s) and/or tearm(s) will be offered a prize pool, paid in XNY. Like our own
Blockchain, we will start working on it as soon as possible, once we are done with our ICO. Our
users will be updated with the details on Cryptonity.

HEROES PROGRAM

We believe that good word-of-mouth is still the most powerful way to promote our platform into
the crypto-community. And we want to make sure that the Heroes who do so are rewarded
accordingly. Our Heroes will have the mission to spread the word about Cryptonity through their
social networks and other tools of their choices by sharing their referral link, and they will be
rewarded with special prizes every time they bring new users into our platform.
INSURANCE & CUSTOMER SERVICE

We want to be the first crypto exchange to provide to our users an insurance. We trust our technical
architecture and want our users to trust it as well. Security and integrity is part of our top priorities
but we also know that perfection (a platform that is 100% secure) doesn’t exist. Even decentralised
exchanges can have flaws and we've seen that with the case of EtherDelta. As far as we know, no
exchange offers a proper insurance in case users’ money is stolen. At Cryptonity we will. We

will keep 7M of our tokens (seven million Cryptonity Tokens) during the Token Sale to ensure our
customers funds. Additionally, once the ICO is finished, we will keep 10% of the raised funds for
insurance purposes. Those funds will be put on a cold wallet alone, and its address on the
Blockchain will available for check by anyone. Some recent hacks have been really devastating.
We all have in mind the case of Bithumb on which the equivalent of around 31 million USD in
cryptocurrency had been stolen. So we want to make sure that in case of an attack, we will be
able to refund our users as much as we can.

Regarding the Customer Service, in order to provide our users with the best assistance, we will
build, step by step, the best Customer Service on the market. At first, we will propose the same
features as the other platforms, which is a support center with “tickets”, to which we guarantee
a prompt response. As soon as possible, we will launch a 24/7 customer support with live chat.
At last, we will also implement a hotline on which our customers will be able to call us in case
of emergency.

CRYPTONITY EXCHANGE FEATURES

In this section, we will detail some features the Cryptonity Exchange will provide, at the launch,
and also the ones we will develop according to our roadmap, step by step.

SECURITY TOOLS

You will find below the list of security features we plan to implement on our exchange. Some of
them will be available at the launch, the others will come on a regular pace, as they are being
developed.

The email for new login with IP address mentioned can be disabled.
Security secret questions and anti-phishing code.

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) through Google Authenticator and Authy.
FIDO U2F Security Key implementation on compatible devices.

Fingerprint unlock available for Cryptonity phone apps

Automatic generation of a PDF with 2FA QR Code and Reset Key to be able to print them
MATCHING ENGINE

We aim at providing one of the most powerful matching engine on the market.
We will support the following three types of orders:
@ Market Orders

@ Limit Orders
@ Stop-Loss Orders

FIAT DEPOSITS & WITHDRAWALS

Users will be able to deposit and withdraw FIAT currencies through SEPA and International SWIFT
Bank Transfers, once their account is verified. This feature will be implemented as soon as possible,
once our negotiation with organisations to get the licence is done. Details will be communicated
on Cryptonity.

ANALYSIS & STRATEGY TOOLS

To help our users make analysis on their trades and build their strategies, we will implement
a “Portfolio” feature that will enable them to easily track their gains and losses for each trade,
configure price alerts, and many other options to be detailed on the platform.

FORKS & AIRDROPS

We plan to support forks but some forks/airdrops are doubtful or useless projects. We would
like to let the community help us choose the right projects.

In the future, we will implement an “Airdrop” feature to give our users the possibility to participate
to an Airdrop, to get credited directly on his/her Cryptonity Exchange account, and to trade the
coin or token directly on our exchange, when it will be listed.

PROOF-OF-STAKE WALLETS, STAKING & MASTERNODE

We aim at being one of the first exchanges to support staking rewards for our customers. We
believe that this is actually the best argument we have, to convince the crypto-community to use
Cryptonity Exchange rather than any other exchange.

If a user holds Proof-of-Stake coins on Cryptonity, we will credit his/her staking onto his/her wallet.
Proof-of-Stake Rewards feature is planned for Q3 2019.

We will also consider implementing Masternode feature in the future.

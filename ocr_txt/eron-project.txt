ERON WHITEPAPER

Posted: 03 August 2021

Last Updated: 03 August 2021

ERONPAPER

Until now, centralization has been a prerequisite for all official structures.
Political, educational and financial systems are, and have always been,
crafted in a way that does not equally and ethically distribute power to those

functioning within them.

While the term DeFi literally includes the word decentralized, this is in

reference to economic status as opposed to its internal hierarchy.

This whitepaper will outline the fundamentals and utility of the ERON
TOKEN and its added applications. Through this paper we will show the
entire network that we will be building around ERON TOKEN and how it will

become a transparent utility and charity community-centric token.

We will also identify our future goals and apps that will interconnect in order

to create the ERON ecosystem and blockchain.

PROJECT GOALS

The project has 2 main goals:
1. Creating a blockchain called ERON blockchain.

2. Using the ERON blockchain to make a difference in real life through

charities.

Terms and Organizational Components
A clear definition for the terms used to describe various actors, and actions,

inside the ERON network:

Users or Network Participants

Any party, individual, entity, enterprise, blockchain or network that uses,
develops, creates or interacts with any aspect of the ERON Network. Users
are identified by a unique account address (derived from their master

public-private key pair stored in a wallet).

Token Holders

Users that are holders of native ERON tokens, to be used on the ERON
Network to submit signed transactions for value transfers, smart contract

execution or to provide liquidity.

Developers

Users that develop smart contracts and/or applications that rely on smart
contracts to provide services. Developers need an account to deploy smart

contracts on the Network.

Consensus group

In order for a block to be proposed and committed, a specific number of
nodes (numNodesConsensus) are randomly selected from all eligible nodes
(eligible NodesPerShard) assigned to a shard to form the consensus group
during each round (blockTime). The consensus group has the responsibility
of committing blocks in that shard, during each round. At the beginning of

each round, a new consensus group is selected.

Nodes
Devices (computers or servers) running the software (the ERON client) and
relaying messages received from their peers. They can be either Validators
(actively participating in securing the network) or Observers (passive
members of the network that can act as a read & relay interface) and can
be either Full (have the entire history of the blockchain) or Light nodes (only

keep 2 epochs of blockchain history).

A node is on the eligible nodes list if several requirements are met:

- arating above a specific threshold

- won a node slot in the selection auction (when auction will be enabled)

Validators

Validators are nodes — computers on the ERON network that process
transactions and secure the network by participating in the consensus
mechanism, while earning rewards from the protocol and transaction fees.
In order to become part of the ERON network, a validator needs to commit
a collateral in the form of ERON tokens, which are staked to align the
incentives of the validators with the correct functioning of the network.
Validators stand to lose some, or all their stake if they deviate from the
protocol instructions, or otherwise collude to disrupt the network. In order
for a node to be able to become a validator it needs to be on the list of

eligible nodes.

Block proposer

The block proposer role is designated to the first selected (through an
unbiasedly, random process) validator node in the consensus group. The
block proposer is the validator who proposes the next block, which the rest

of the consensus group must verify and approve.
1. CREATING OUR ERON BLOCKCHAIN

OUR OWN NODES

Technology wise, the ERON PROJECT embodies the team’s wish to make
digital assets a component of real life by having real use in disadvantaged
areas and for people that cannot otherwise succeed in having the most

basic living standards.

The ERON PROJECT runs on its own nodes developed on the Ethereum &
Web3 blockchain, using the GO implementation of Ethereum, the GETH

platform.

This relies on a boot node that allows the connection of other nodes within
the blockchain. In time, more virtual machines can be connected to the boot
node in order to facilitate the validation mechanism for blockchain
transactions, but also to offer API to verify transaction hashes, transfers,

deployments of Smart Contracts, aso.

For the moment there is a published boot node on a AWS server and 18
nodes that will be connected to the boot node. All servers will run Linux and
will be protected by a datacentre firewall, as well as an operating system

firewall.

Currently the network is private and, in the future, the virtual machine can

be downloaded in order to start decentralising it.

As more and more nodes join the network through our MINING application,

will develop our ERON blockchain.

The chosen consensus model involves multiple communication rounds;
thus, the result is highly influenced by the network quality (speed, latency,

availability).
The process of designing distributed architectures on blockchain faces
several challenges, perhaps one of the most challenging being the struggle
to maintain operability under contextual pressure conditions. The main

components that determine the performance pressure are:

* complexity - the first element that limits the system performance, is the

consensus protocol.

* system size - expanding the number of nodes in existing validated
architectures forces a serious performance degradation and induces a

higher computational price that must be paid.

* transaction volume

DESIGN

The design behind the future ERON blockchain will have the following
principles:

1. Simplicity - the ERON protocol should be as simple as possible, even at

the cost of some data storage or time inefficiency.

2. Universality — a fundamental part of ERON’s design philosophy is that

ERON will not have “features”.

3. Modularity — the parts of the ERON protocol should be design to be as

modular and as separable as possible, while also being interconnectable.

4. Agility — the details of the ERON protocol will be created to be give the
highest agility possible.

5. Non-discrimination and non-censorship — the ERON protocol will not

attempt to actively restricts or prevent specific categories of usage.
The ERON network will have 2 types of accounts:

1. externally owned accounts, controlled by private keys
2. contract accounts, controlled by their contract code.

An externally owned account has no code, and one can send messages
from an externally owned account by creating and signing a transaction; in
a contract account, every time the contract account receives a message its
code activates, allowing it to read and write to internal storage and send

other messages or create contracts in turn.

APPLICATIONS:

There will be 3 types of applications on top of the ERON network in the
beginning:

Semi financial application:

ERON MARKET - future marketplace www.eronmarket.eu

Full financial applications:

ERON PAY - future payment processor www.eronpay.com

ERON WALLET - future cryptocurrency wallet www.eronwallet.com
Non-financial applications:

ERON MINER -— the mining application miner.eroncoin.com

BLUE MONITOR - the utility monitoring app that helps the charity goal of
the ERON PROJECT

ERON TOKEN

"ERON" is a utility token and the main internal crypto-fuel of ERON network
that is also used to pay transaction fees.

The launch of the ERON is on the following schedule:

PRIVATE SALE — 04.08.2021 — 04.09.2021
ETH PRE-SALE — 05.09.2021 - 20.09.2021

BNB PRE-SALE — 21.09.2021 - 16.10.2021 EXTENDED until 31.10.2021
AIRDROPS — 21.09.2021 — 25.10.2021

EXCHANGE LISTING — until December 31st, 2021

Despite the fact that it is a utility token, it will also be the engine behind the

charity component of this project.

The ERON smart contract is an upgradable Ethereum contract that has a

pause function, but lacks blacklist or additional mint options.

There is however a minimum and maximum limit for both buying / selling,

that acts like a anti-whale mechanism.
ETH PRE SALE LIMITS: 1000 USDT to 15.000 USDT
BSC PRE SALE LIMITS: 0.001 BNB to 20 BNB

LIMITS AFTER SWAP LISTING: 100 ERON TOKENS to 1.500.000 ERON
TOKENS

Tokenomics:

The economic aspects being implemented must take into consideration that,
regardless of the monetary value of a particular token, there are factors that

influence the wellbeing of the system, namely:

e the inflation should be small enough to not "tax" the token holders, but
large enough to cover their “hodling” costs in the initial stages of private

sale and pre sale

e the monetary supply being held should be large enough so that there are
enough distinct entities that collusion is unlikely, but small enough so that

money velocity is not affected (MV=PQ)

Total supply: 1.000.000.000.000
Charity wallet: 200.000.000.000

Team wallet: 150.000.000.000

Operational Wallet: 48.000.000.000
Marketing wallet:75.000.000.000

Exchange liquidity withheld: 250.000.000.000
Swap & Pre-Sale Liquidity: 277.000.000.000
Taxes / transaction (buy and/or sell):

1% redistribution tax (reflection)

1% tax to charity

1% burn tax
ERON FOR GAS FEES:

The ERON will serves the dual purpose of providing a primary liquidity layer

to allow for efficient exchange between various types of digital assets and,
more importantly, of providing a mechanism for paying transaction fees.

For convenience and to avoid future argument, the denominations will be

pre-labelled:
1: eban

10°: ban

The issuance model will be as follows:

ERON will be released in a private sale at the price of 4.000.000 ERONs
per ETH, a mechanism intended to fund the ERON organization and pay for
development that has been used with success by other platforms such as

Mastercoin and NXT.
Earlier buyers will benefit from larger discounts. The ETH received from the
sale will be used 49% to pay salaries and to fund the project and 51% will

be added to the liquidity pool of the ERON TOKEN.

ERON MARKET

ERONMARKET is the marketplace of the ERON project, through which
people can buy products with cryptocurrency. The main currency of the

platform will be ERON, but we will also have a stable coin.

Any company that wants to sign up and sell their products can do so, just

like any user can sign in using their wallet and buy.

The important thing is the app is 100% decentralised, thus there will be no

data saved on any server.

The users can easily log in the marketplace using their ERON WALLET or
other ERC-20 wallets and buy any good at any price as long as they have

enough tokens in their wallet and they specify the shipping address.

30% of the fees of the marketplace will go towards the capitalization of the
ERON TOKEN.

ERONPAY

ERONPAY is the upcoming payment processing application of the project

that will make it easy to buy, sell and trade any cryptocurrency.

This app acts as a binder between ERON WALLET, ERON MARKET and
ERON TOKEN.

Any person can download ERON WALLET, hit the buy button and use their
credit/debit card to buy ERONs or other cryptocurrency and have it added

to their wallet.
Any person can access ERON MARKET, hit the buy button and use their
credit/debit card to buy an item. ERONPAY will automatically convert any

FIAT into ERONs and pay for the item in the shopping cart.
The taxes for any transaction are as follows:

$0-$50 - $1.75

$50-$100 —- 1.1%

$100-$500 - 1%

$500-$1000 -0.9%

$1000-$2000 - 0.8

$2000-$5000 - 0.7%

$5000-$10000 — 0.6%

Above $10000 - 0.5%

ERONWALLET

ERONWALLET is the upcoming wallet that will be created in order to have
an easier access and use to all the project’s applications.

ERONWALLET will have a fixed gas fee that will be determined after the
start of the decentralisation of the project, through download of virtual

machines by users.

It will accept any currency for transactions into ERONs and will also have a
bridge in order to facilitate the exchange from different blockchains as BSC,

ROPSTER, ERC, TRON, aso.

In the ERON network, the state is made up of objects called "accounts",
with each account having a 20-byte address and state transitions being

direct transfers of value and information between accounts.
An ERON account account contains four fields:

1. the nonce, a counter used to make sure each transaction can only be

processed once
2. the account's current ERON balance
3. the account's contract code, if present

4. the account's storage (empty by default)

ERON MINER

ERON MINER is the mining application for ERON TOKEN where all users
can earn 0.5 ERON/hour and 20% of the current mining rate of every person

invited into their downline.

As the mining process will create tokens, there will be a 50% cut of the

mining rate at the following milestones:

75.000.000.000 — 50% cut from 1 ERON to 0.5 ERON
125.000.000.000 — 50% cut from 0.5 ERON to 0.25 ERON
150.000.000.000 — 50% cut from 0.25 ERON to 0.125 ERON
The total mining supply needed will be 175.000.000.000 ERONs.

Every 50% cut of the mining rate will also mean a 50% cut of the referral

commission of 20%:

75.000.000.000 — 50% cut from 0.2 ERON / referral to 0.1 ERON / referral
125.000.000.000 — 50% cut from 0.1 ERON / referral to 0.05 EROWN/ referral
150.000.000.000 — 50% cut from 0.05 ERON to 0.025 ERON / referral

Once the total needed supply will be complete the application will stop

mining.
All users will be able to see the mining balance in their account on the

application at any given moment.

The users will receive the mined balance once the total needed supply will
be accomplished. At the end of the process, once they receive their tokens,
they will have the option of putting all mined tokens into a staking pool,

where they will receive 10% interest/ month.

The main goal of this mining application is to supply liquidity for the

upcoming ERON MARKET and ERON PAY.

The users will be able to use their mined ERONs in the ERON MARKET in
order to buy products. The value of the mined ERON at any given moment
will be the same as the value of the ERON TOKEN that will be listed on the

exchange.

Technical overview of the mining process:

The current intent at ERON is to use a mining algorithm where miners are
required to fetch random data from the state, compute some randomly
selected transactions from the last N blocks in the blockchain, and return

the hash of the result. This has two important benefits.

First, ERON contracts can include any kind of computation, so an ERON
ASIC would essentially be an ASIC for general computation - ie. a better

CPU.

Second, mining requires access to the entire blockchain, forcing miners to
store the entire blockchain and at least be capable of verifying every
transaction. This removes the need for centralized mining pools; although
mining pools can still serve the legitimate role of evening out the
randomness of reward distribution, this function can be served equally well

by peer-to-peer pools with no central control.

BLUEMONITOR
Through the current BLUEMONITOR app that is already functional in
monitoring the gas/electric/water consumption, the users will be
recompensated with ERON tokens if they can acquire a stable consumption

rate in accordance to the same month of the previous year.

The users that will manage to decrease their consumption by 5% every year,
will be annually recompensated with tokens for their active involvement in

decreasing pollution.

2. CHARITY

The charity component of our project is to identify disadvantaged areas that
do not benefit from gas, electricity and water networks and to build those

networks or extensions to the current networks.

The build will be done through companies that are authorized and licensed

in these fields, in disadvantaged areas of Romania and abroad.

These new networks or extensions will be leased to local providers as per
the legal framework of every country country. 50% of every lease will be

reinvested into building future networks or extensions.

If the gas/electric/water provider will implement the digital asset ERON
TOKEN, then the provider will receive back 50% of the lease fee in ERONs.
These ERONSs can be used only as discounts for the future bills of the actual

beneficiaries of the gas/electric/water networks.

CONCLUSION:

As any project in the beginning, we are aware that we might not have all
our info in this whitepaper and that there will be hard times and obstacles

as well as successes. This is the reason why we will update our website
and whitepaper weekly in order to show our progress and to make everyone

understand what ERON is, where it is heading and how to use it.

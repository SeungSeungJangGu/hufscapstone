WHITE PAPER

(IP WIBIR
WINNERS &
LOSERS

common misconception with the heavy APY average is the

subjectivity of the impermanent loss from staking an LP (liquidity

provider) in a Farming reward generator. With the explosion of DeFi
we have seen too many new cryptocurrency prospectors get sucked into a
high APY LP-farming trap, Feeling hopeless as they are pushed out by earlier
buyers with higher staking rewards. We've all been there, seeing those shiny
6 digit Figures can be pretty damn tempting to jump in. However, almost
always the token suffers From the inevitable valuation bubble, which is then
Followed by the burst and the impending collapse of the price. This Is why we
have seen the mass adoption of static rewards, also Known as reflection, a
separate concept that seeks to eliminate the troubles caused by Farming
rewards. SAFEMOON seeks to build on that concept by introducing a Few
added Features that build on the existing models of static reward tokens to
drive the price to stratospheric all time highs.
SAFEMOON PROTOCOL

WAY STATIC?

Static rewards solve a host of problems. First, the reward amount is

conditional upon the volume of the token being traded. This mechanism aims
to alleviate some of the downward sell pressure put on the token caused by
earlier adopters selling their tokens after Farming crazy high APY’s. Second,
the reflect mechanism encourages holders to hang onto their tokens to
garner higher kick-backs which are based upon a percentages carried out
and dependant upon the total tokens held by the owner. In theory, with the
manual burn Function and a depreciating supply, even a small holder at the
beginning could potentially walk away with big money at the end of the

token’s lifespan.

Wanual Burns

Sometimes burns matter; sometimes they don’t. A continuous burn on any
one protocol can be nice in the early days, however,.this means the burn
cannot be finite or controlled in any way. Having burns controlled by the
team and promoted based on achievements helps to keep the community
rewarded and informed. The conditions of the manual burn and the amounts
can be advertised and tracked. SafeMoon aims to implement a burn strategy
that is beneficial and rewarding For those engaged For the long term.
Furthermore, the total number of SAFEMOON burned is featured on our
readout located on the website which allows for Further transparency in
identifying the current circulating supply at any given point of time.
SAFEMOON PROTOCOL

AUTOMATIC LP

Automatic LP is the secret sauce of SAFEMOON. Here we have a Function
that acts as a two-fold beneficial implementation For holders. First, the
contract sucks up tokens From sellers and buyers alike, and adds them to the
LP creating a solid price Floor. Second, the penalty acts as an arbitrage
resistant mechanism that secures the volume of SAFEMOON as a reward
for the holders. In theory, the added LP creates a stability From the supplied
LP by adding the tax to the overall liquidity of the token, thus increasing the
tokens overall LP and supporting the price Floor of the token. This is
different From the burn Function of other reflection tokens which is only
beneficial.in the short term From the granted reduction of supply. As the
SAFEMOON token LP increases, the price stability mirrors this Function with
the benefit of a solid price Floor and cushion for holders. The goal here is to
prevent the larger dips when whales decide to sell their tokens later in the
game, which keeps the price from Fluctuating as much as if there was no
automatic LP Function. All of this is an effort to alleviate some of the
troubles we have seen with the current DeFi reflection tokens. We are
confident that this model and protocol will prevail over the outdated

reflection tokens For these reasons.

SafeMoon Protocol

SafeMoon employs 3 simple Functions: Reflection + LP acquisition + Burn
In each trade, the transaction is taxed a 10% Fee, which is split 2 ways.

= 5% Fee = redistributed to all existing holders

= 5% Fee is split SO/SO half of which is sold by the contract into BNB, while
the other half of the SAFEMOON tokens are paired automatically with the
previously mentioned BNB and added as a liquidity pair on Pancake Swap.

Safecoin: The Decentralised Network Token

Nick Lambert, Qi Ma and David Irvine

January 2015

Abstract

There are many examples of tokens (coins) be-
ing an effective mechanism for incentivising be-
haviour. These cases demonstrate the benefits
of tokens in a wide variety of settings, but there
is evidence that they are effective within a com-
uter networking environment. This paper at-
empts to explain the reasoning behind safecoin,
he digital token of the SAFE Network, a decen-
ralised data and communications network. It is
anticipated that the introduction of safecoin will
incentivise behaviour that ensures the long term
health of the network for all its users.

1 Token Economies

tokens to incentivise behaviour is not
their use in multiple settings prove
their utility. For example, token economy sys-
tems have been used to influence and guide be-
haviour in animals, prison populations, the mil-
itary and education [12]. Doll et al. (2013) de-
scribe the nature of a token economy:

The use o
novel and

“Within a token economy, tokens
are most often a neutral stimulus in the
form of points or tangible items that
are awarded to economy participants
for target behaviours.”

In essence, tokens provide their holder with per-
ceived economic or social benefit as a reward for
acting out defined and desired actions. Bitcoin
represents an excellent example of stimulating
action (mining) through token reward. Its abil-
ity to eliminate double spending by harnessing

the power of a distributed consensus network has
given rise to a plethora of new digital currencies
and assets. At the time of writing, there are cur-
rently 571 currencies listed on the leading cryp-
tocurrency market capitalisation website [1].
However, it is the Bitcoin protocol and the
additional features created by so called Bitcoin
2.0 technologies that are particularly interesting.
The protocol enables additional features to be
incorporated into the block chain (Bitcoin’s im-
mutable public ledger). These features include
he ability for anyone to create digital assets or
okens that are cryptographically secured and in-
extricably tied to an ID on the network. These
okens can represent either ownership, or access
0 services.

The case for using tokens within a computer
network is further strengthened by technologies
hat were restricted from reaching their potential
in the absence of any incentivisation mechanism.
One such example is TOR, software that pro-
vides user anonymity by redirecting Internet
raffic through a series of relays run by volun-
eers, who contribute their own computing re-
sources to the TOR network. Current metrics
rom the network report that around 6500 re-
ays are in operation while there are in excess
of 2,000,000 directly connected users [3] [4]. In
order that the network continues to expand, the
roject recognises that the current volunteer ap-
roach is not sufficient and incentives to run re-
ays are required. One of the suggested solutions
is TorCoin, a incentivisation mechanism that at-
empts to compensate users running relays. It is
roposed that TorCoin will enable relays to mine
or TorCoins once they have successfully trans-

ferred a batch of data packets across the network
as a reward for providing bandwidth to the Tor
network [5].

1.1 The SAFE Network

The SAFE (Secure Access For Everyone) Net-
work, is a P2P decentralised data and commu-
nications network designed and built by Maid-
Safe.net and is currently in implementation
phase [6]. The network will compliment all
existing centralised web services and data cen-
tres with a secure and anonymous network com-
prised of the spare computing resources of its
users. It is anticipated that this new network
will provide a more secure and private experi-
ence, whilst achieving higher performance as the
network reaches critical mass.

2 Safecoin

The requirement of users to contribute is an un-
mistakable part of any P2P network and the
implementation of incentives is essential to en-
sure its health. The introduction of safecoin, the
cryptographic token of the SAFE Network, is an
approach designed to encourage a number of dif
ferent users and contributors to the network.

Safecoins can only exist on SAFE and it’s dis-
tribution is handled entirely by the network on
a per use basis. It is anticipated that 4.3 billion
coins will be produced during the life of the net-
work. Each safecoin has it’s own unique identity
and they are required to access services on the
Safe Network. The type of services that will be
available will depend on those being developed
by third party developers. It is worth noting
any type of web service currently possible
on the existing centralised Internet is possible on
the SAFE Network. The cost for these services

will be set by the service provider and it is an-
ticipated that as more and more competing apps
are developed that market forces will maintain

prices at. economic levels.

3 Obtaining Safecoin

Safecoin can be obtained through; farming, as-
sisting with the maintenance of the underly-
ing code, creating applications or by purchasing
them.

Farming is a process akin to bitcoin mining,
whereby users provide resource (storage space,
CPU and bandwidth) to the network. When
each user creates their credentials, they will set
up a safecoin wallet via their SAFE Network
client and this wallet identity will be crypto-
graphically linked to their account. As figure
1 demonstrates, the safecoin earning algorithm
is based on a Sigmoid curve, in that all vaults
earn, slowly at first and the rate increases as the
farmer stores up to the network average. The
earning rate also takes into account the rank of
the vault, a process whereby the network scores
the usefulness of each node from 0 (being the
worst) to 1 (the best). The safecoin farming rate
is ultimately the result of the network rate, a bal-
ance of the demand and supply on the network,
multiplied by the vault rank. The network rate
will start to level at 20% above average, thus
discouraging massive vaults which would bring
centralisation to the network’s farming process.
Safecoin is allocated to them by the network and
is paid to the successful node as data is retrieved
from it (GETS), as opposed to when it is stored
(PUTS).

Resource Provided

The network automatically increases farming
rewards as space is required and reduces them
as space becomes abundant. Data is evenly dis-
tributed on the network and therefore farmers
looking to maximise their earnings may do so
by running several average performance nodes
rather than one high specification node.

3.1 Proof of Resource

Utilising a process called Proof of Resource
(POR), the network is able to continually val-
idate who and what is providing resource to it in
a mathematically verifiable way. The networ
does this by attempting to store and retrieve
data chunks onto/from its nodes. The ability
for a node to carry out these actions will be de-
termined by a combination of its CPU speed,
bandwidth availability, unused storage capacity
and on-line time. The SAFE Network uses a
zero knowledge proof mechanism, where the net-
work does not require to know the content of any
data to be checked, but must know the data is in
fact held and held in a manner that is accurate.
Nodes that are either unreliable or are trying to
game the network, by removing previously pro-
vided resource, are de ranked by the network if
the node is unable to serve a chunk of data.

3.2 Core Development and Build-
ing Applications

It is also possible for core developers to earn safe-
coin by fixing bugs and developing new features
for the underlying network. At the time of writ-
ing, this process has not yet been finalised. It is
possible that code bounties will be raised by the
core development team in conjunction with the
SAFE project community. There are a number
of existing platforms that facilitate the advertise-
ment and management of code bounties, such as
Bountysource and Bountify [71 [8].

People or companies building applications on
the SAFE Network will also be able to earn safe-
coins. As they create and release new applica-
tions, they will code their SAFE wallet address
into their application. Based on how much the
application is used, the network will pay safe-

coins to the safecoin wallet address of the app
creator. This provides a built in revenue stream
for app developers, one that is directly propor-
tional to how successful their application is.

3.3. Decentralised Exchanges

It will also be possible to buy safecoin. It is an-
ticipated that these purchases will be made from
decentralised peer to peer exchanges that will be
built by third party developers. These exchanges
will serve as platforms, enabling a buyer and
seller to trade directly, potentially using multi
signature (3 or more private keys are associated
with an address, a majority must sign to make
the transaction valid) technology to manage the
transaction. It would also be possible to have
centralised exchanges.

Exchanges are essential to the liquidity of safe-
coin as they ensure that people unwilling or un-
able (as they are using a mobile device) can still
gain access to network services. Additionally, ex-
changes will also enable those earning safecoins
to convert them into cash or into other cryp-
tocurrencies.

4 The Price of Safecoin

As with other digital coins, the exchange or pur-
chase price of safecoin will be set. by the market.
This is a price established through the combi-
nation of supply and demand. As this paper
has already described, the number of safecoins
in circulation will increase based on network use.
Almost all early safecoin holders will be farmers
with this supply of resource creating both liquid-
ity and distribution of wealth. It is anticipated
that almost all users will possess at least a few
safecoins in their wallet. Users may trade their
safecoin for services on the network, or for cash
(or another digital currency) using an exchange.
The ratio of safecoin being saved (left in new
wallets) versus the ratio being issued to Farmers
will produce a price point. This point will be the
market value of safecoin.

It is anticipated that as the number of applica-
tions on the network grows, the utility of safecoin
will increase, helping to drive the price of the
coin overtime. This, coupled with the increase
supply of safecoin, will also potentially increase
the stability of the coin. Safecoins will not have
a finite quantity, as after the initial 4.3 billion
are produced, a small percentage (dependent on
usage) will be recycled in order to incentivise the
storage of new data.

The number of resources or services it is pos-
sible to buy will not be linked to the exchange
price. The amount of storage, for example, that
each safecoin buys over time will increase, oth-
erwise the network resources could become very
expensive if allowed to rise in line with the ex-
change price. This is highlighted in figure 2.

5 The Transaction Manager

Unlike Bitcoin, the SAFE Network does not use a
block chain to manage ownership of coins. Con-
versely, the SAFE Network’s Transaction Man-
agers are unchained, meaning that only the past
and current coin owner is known. It is helpful to
think of safecoin as digital cash in this respect,
providing safecoin users with more anonymity
than they experience with bitcoin.

The Transaction Manager is a persona or
role carried out by the SAFE Network’s vaults.
Vaults store data on a Farmer’s computer and
consist of a series of processes or roles that
vary from managing the storage of data, man-

aging other vaults and more importantly in this
case, managing the processing and completion of
transactions. The entire SAFE Network reaches
decisions based on consensus of close groups of 32
nodes and the transaction manager is the trusted
group closest to any given transaction identity.
These close groups are chosen by the network
based on the closeness of their IDs to the ID
of the safecoin. Closeness in this respect refers
to the XOR distance as opposed to geographical
closeness [9].

One of the major problems any virtual cur-

rency or
to avoid

coin must overcome is the ability
ouble spending. Within the SAFE
Network, transfer of data, safecoin included,
is atomic, using a cryptographic signature to
demonstrate that the last person who owned the
safecoin has signed the coin over to the curren
owner. When the current owner spends the coin,
they ask the network (their close group of 32) to
accept a signed message transferring ownership
to the new owner. This process is highlighte
in figure 3. The knowledge of coin ownership
(each has their own unique ID) is kept in several
close groups and each group must agree upon
and reach consensus (28 of 32) on the transfer
of ownership before the transaction is processe
and the ownership of the coin is transferred.

6 Minting safecoin

The transaction model, described in Section 5,
enables safecoin ownership to be transferred.
However, it will be possible, after the SAFE Net-
work is launched, to mint safecoin in a more
physical and anonymous way.
Minting safecoin can be achieved by the net-
work enabling the registration of a special trans-
action with the transaction managers, that fa-
cilitates transfer of the ownship of the coin to
any user that acknowledges the transaction. The
minting process effectively removes the require-
ment for the transaction validation step from
the Transaction Manager. When Alice wants to
mint safecoin, she sends a request to Transaction
Managers with a special request to transfer the
coin(s) to anyone. The Transaction Managers,
once they have confirmed by consensus that Al
ice is the current owner, will then generate the
ransaction. Once Alice receives the transaction
name from the network, she can store it on an
external storage device, such as a usb drive, to-
gether with a special validation signature which
has been used as a salt when generating the pre-
vious sent request] This salt is used to prevent
Transaction Managers themselves trying to ac-
nowledge the transaction to steal the coin.
When Bob receives the minted safecoin and
decides he would like to spend them, he reads the
ransaction name and the validation signature
rom the storage device and then sends an ac-
nowledgement to the network. Once the Trans-
action Managers receive the acknowledgement,
he pre-generated transaction will be updated,
hus completing the transfer of ownership of that
coin(s) from Alice to Bob.
The benefit of using safecoin in this way is a
reduction in the complexity of the transaction by
removing the acknowledgement procedure, mak-
ing minted safecoin similar to a cash note. It also
means that Alice, in this case, no longer needs
to worry about keeping her private key safe as

the transaction has been pre generated. Minted
safecoin is also more anonymous, eliminating the
need to store safecoins only in a digital wallet
that can be compromised should an adversory
obtain access to a users SAFE Network creden-
tials. However, there is risk that after the trans-
fer transaction has been registered, if the owner
loses the external storage device containing the
safecoin(s), anyone will be able to claim owner-
ship. However, this is no greater than the risk
anyone undertakes when withdrawing cash from
a bank, convenience comes at the price of secu-
rity.

7 The Economics of Safecoin

Unlike many cryptocurrencies, whose creation is
not backed by anything, the distribution of safe-
coin is backed by data. The generation of safe-
coin is entirely network led and they are only
created as the network is used and data retrieved
from network nodes. This activity is in contrast
to currencies like bitcoin, whose coin distribu-
tion is arbitrarily set to 10 minute blocks. This
means that if the SAFE Network is in great de-
mand a large volume of safecoins will be created,
while low demand will lead to minimal coins be-
ing generated. This demand generation cycle has
a desirable affect in that it should ensure no over
supply of safecoins, which may potentially lead
to a unit price decrease. This is not to say that
the price of safecoin will not be volatile, the com-
paratively small coin supply (Bitcoin’s market
capitalisation is currently $5.2 billion, whereas
the US Dollar has around $17 trillion (M4 defi-
nition - notes, coins and bank accounts) in circu-
lation) of cryptocurrencies makes this inevitable.
However, it may provide greater stability in the
long term [11].
In many respects, the underlying economics of
safecoin can be directly compared to Cap and
Trade Economics, a strategy utilised by gov-
ernments in an attempt to limit the amount
of greenhouse (GHG) emitted by private enter-
prises [16]. In the same way that the Cap and
Trade system limits the overall emissions, en-

Furthermore, current supply of traditional
FIAT currencies has become elastic, with cen-
tral banks of many nations engaging in quanti-
tative easing, effectively printing money to en-
sure greater supply. Unfortunately this can have
many negative consequences as printing money
does not solve the underlying economic problems
and can potentially lead to increases in inflation
[2]. These drawbacks have led some economists
o start calling for a return to the gold standard,
a situation where supply of money was linked to
he supply of gold, known to be valuable and
very difficult to counterfeit: [18].

With coin generation on the SAFE Network
eing directly linked to network use, the issuance
of safecoins will be linked to supply and demand
or data services. Data is valuable and is con-
sidered by some as becoming a commodity in its
own right. The World Economic Forum has es-
ablished data as an asset class [13]. The realisa-
ion of data having significant monetary value is
also born out by recent valuations in technology
companies, many of whom are not sustainable
[IZ]. Having a network generated digital cur
rency inextricably linked to a valuable commod-
ity, has the potential for a stable environment,
one that as the money supply increases, has the
potential to be more resistant to price fluctua
tions.

8 A Revenue Model for a
New Internet

In addition to incentivising user behaviour, safe-
coin may also provide an alternative revenue
source for the Internet, in the shape of micro
payments. It is possible to implement safecoin
without transaction costs (although these could
be added to aid security?) and high divisibility

? An adversory could process a large number of trans-
action requests to the network in an attempt to overload

(coins are valued at $0.05 at the time of writ-
ing (Jan 2015) and have the potential to be di-
vided up to 4.3 billion times) make them well
suited to very low value transactions. Further-
more, the SAFE Networks ability to enable an
unlimited number of transactions with confirma-
tions at network speed equips it well for micro
payments.
Micro payments are one of many ways to re-
place the current methods of funding today’s
centralised Internet, typically this is achieved
through advertising. Large Internet companies,
such as Google and Facebook, earn the vast ma-
jority of their revenue (91% and 89% respec-
tively) by selling adverts at their users [15] [14].
This model has been criticised as it not only pro-
motes increasing surveillance of user data, as ad-
vertisers require to know more and more about
us, but also removes the rewards away from con-
ent creators [10].
would be technically feasible, using safecoin
on the SAFE Network, to pay for films on a cost
er frame basis, with the user only paying for
what they watch. This amount would automati-
cally be deducted from the viewers safecoin wal-
et as they watch. A similar model could also be
utilised for music, or for bloggers, with individ-
ual articles paid for via a paywall or on a volun-
ary basis. The decision about how to structure
ayment for their work would reside with the
copyright owner. The SAFE Network enables
an optional watermarking feature that serves to
inform the user the identity of the content cre-
ator, however, this should not be confused with
a DRM mechanism.

gies that did not reach their full potential as their
incentives were poorly aligned. Tokens or coins
have been used in a wide vareity of settings, in-
cluding decentralised computer networks, to mo-

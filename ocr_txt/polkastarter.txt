Why Polkastarter

The adoption of DeFi (Decentralized Finance) solutions has finally arrived with hugely successful
projects like Uniswap and Compound bringing billions of trading volume to the cryptocurrency
market, while taking an increasing market share from the centralized exchanges.

This success comes with a number of great challenges, especially in terms of scalability, with
Ethereum network fees skyrocketing and slow platform performances, which leaves end-users
frustrated.

Users are demanding cheap transactions, secure ultra-fast swaps, user-friendly design and the
possibility to buy and move assets between blockchains. The future of decentralised finance won't
be tied to one chain and interoperability is already becoming the must-have feature of the DeFi
future.

Introducing Polkastarter

Polkastarter is a permissionless DEX built for cross-chain token
pools and auctions, enabling projects to raise capital on a
decentralized and interoperable environment based on Polkadot.

With Polkastarter, decentralized projects will be able to raise and
exchange capital cheap and fast. Users will be able to participate
in a secure and compliant environment and to use assets that go
way beyond the current ERC20 standard.

The future is decentralized. The future is interoperable. The future
is Polkastarter.

Detailed Roadmap 2020 & 2021

We are excited to release our initial technical
roadmap. Will also outline the Polkastarter
platform and our plans for the future.

The final version of Polkastarter will enable
Polkadot-based token pools so projects can
raise capital in a decentralized and
interoperable environment. However, to fully
reach our vision, since Polkadot is not ready for
the deployment of smart contracts,
Polkastarter’s roadmap will have two separate
phases.

Latest Pools

Detailed Roadmap 2020 & 2021

Phase 1 will start with the launch of a minimum viable product (MVP) on the Ethereum network. The goal of this phase is to test the
swap and token sale dynamics, gather user feedback, and prepare a robust infrastructure that can be migrated to Polkadot. With a
variety of EVM-compatible Polkadot projects competing to be parachains, we are confident that our work on Ethereum will enable us

to bootstrap development work on Polkadot.

Phase 2 will see the full launch of the working product on the Polkadot environment, enabling Polkadot projects to raise funds in DOT
or any other Polkadot-based tokens that the project chooses to raise in. Our vision is for Polkastarter to offer cross-chain pools and

token sales, by taking advantage of Polkadot's bridges such as BTC, ETH and USDT.

Polkastarter MVP Core Features

In the past few months, we've been actively developing the first version of Polkastarter on Ethereum.
The goal for the MVP is to be a fully working fixed swap platform for ERC20 token pools, creating a
marketplace that links pool creators and liquidity providers.

Pool creators will be able to create and launch fixed token swaps in a permissionless environment.
Liquidity providers will be able to earn and transact in these new tokens.

Community incentives such as liquidity mining will be live from day one to bootstrap network effects.

Our strong and growing Polkastarter community will be incentivized to improve the usability and
interface to optimize the platform experience before launching in Polkadot’s environment.

Polkastarter MVP Core Features

Fixed Swap Pools

From our homepage, users can explore and participate in
several token pools. These will be fixed swap pools, in which
two or more parties exchange a fixed amount of tokens for a
predetermined price.

In this initial prototype, pool creators will be able to enter pool =
details like token contract address, name of the pool, limit per
address, type of pool access (public, private, whitelist) and,
finally, token price.

unk oor

We are starting with fixed swap pools because they solve one
of the biggest problems in automated decentralized
exchanges like Uniswap. While these exchanges are great for
day-to-day spot trading, they don’t work that well for token
sales. It’s usually impossible to get the initial listed token price
because bots buy up all the initial liquidity. On the other hand,
Polkastarter Fixed Swaps will enable a stable, organized, and
fair token swap infrastructure.

Polkastarter MVP Core Features

Liquidity Mining

To incentivize participation in the daily token pools, we are launching a liquidity mining program
concurrent with MVP launch on Ethereum later this year. In the manner of great DeFi projects like
Synthetix and Balancer, this program will distribute a fixed amount of POLS tokens daily. All liquidity
providers will receive POLS from this as-yet-undetermined fixed amount on a pro-rata basis. For
example, if there is 1000 ETH in fixed swap volume for 24 hours, a user that contributed 100 ETH of that
volume will receive 10% of the total daily liquidity rewards.

Liquidity providers can claim their POLS token rewards after 24 hours and will have 7 days to claim
their reward tokens on the Polkastarter dashboard. Unclaimed tokens will be sent back to the rewards
pool for later distribution.

Staking for Pool Access

For high-demand pools, access can be limited to the top liquidity and network contributors. Password
protection and whitelisting are potential features that could provide additional limits. However, to
best align the interests of the entire Polkastarter community, the POLS token can be used as a
coordinating mechanism. For instance, if community members want access to certain token pools,
they must stake POLS tokens. Of course, token pool creators have full autonomy over this process. For
projects that use the Polkastarter platform, our goal is to craft diverse token holder communities loyal
to the project and invested in its long-term success.
Polkastarter MVP Core Features

Private Pools And Whitelisting (By Potose

One of the Polkastarter use cases is private fundraising and Nene
closed over the counter (OTC) deals. To enable these, we will
launch with features like password protected pools and address om
whitelisting for pool participation.

Permissionless Listings

True decentralization only works if we build a permissionless
environment. Though certain Polkastarter features may be
enhanced for POLS token holders, anyone will be able to use the
protocol in order to create and launch fixed swap token pools.
Counter-measures to prevent bot-based and malicious pools
will also be integrated.

Other Features

Anti-scam features preventing users from buying the wrong
token. These include smart contract verification, smart contract
information, token import alert and high slippage alerts. All of
these mechanisms work together to make users aware that they
might be buying at an unfair price. Finally, we would be remiss if
we didn’t mention that the platform can be viewed in either dark
or light mode.

Token Utility ($POLS)

Governance and Fees

projects get to be featured by Polkastarter. Transaction fees will be paid in POLS.

Token Utility ($POLS)

Staking for Pool Rewards

Token pools on Polkastarter will incur a fixed fee, paid by the pool creator. If a pool creator receives
1000 DOT worth of a token and the fee is fixed at 1%, 10 DOT will be deducted from his purchase and
added to the staking reward pool.

Staking rewards will also be distributed in 24-hour cycles. If a user holds 2% of the total staked POLS
during that 24-hour cycle, that user will get the equivalent of 2% of all the staking rewards for that
same period. If during that period Polkastarter generated 10,000 DOT, that user will get 200 DOT.

Polkastarter network users are only eligible for staking after providing liquidity to the Polkastarter
pools. Contributors can lose their staking status if they stop providing liquidity to the network.

Staking for Pool Access

For high-demand pools, access can be limited to the top liquidity and network contributors. Password
protection and whitelisting are potential features that could provide additional limits. However, to
best align the interests of the entire Polkastarter community, the POLS token can be used as a
coordinating mechanism.

For instance, if community members want access to certain token pools, they must stake POLS
tokens. Of course, token pool creators have full autonomy over this process. For projects that use the
Polkastarter platform, our goal is to craft diverse token holder communities loyal to the project and
invested in its long-term success.

Pool creators can activate POLS staking to limit pool access exclusively to POLS holders. The incentive
for this type of behavior from the pool creator is a reduced fee on the total swapped funds.

Token Utility ($POLS)

Staking for Governance

The Polkastarter governance framework aims to build a solid and sustainable protocol for
development and usage. POLS holders will be able to vote for ecosystem initiatives, new features
development, liquidity rewards distribution specs, and other applications.

POLS holders need to stake POLS in order to be able to vote and to submit proposals. Proposals will be
first discussed off-chain on the Polkastarter governance platform. The idea of this pre-voting
mechanism is to promote proposal discussion before on-chain submission.

Once the proposal is ready to be submitted, there will be an on-chain vote. Every winning proposal is
then reviewed and applied by the Polkastarter development and management team.

Token Utility ($POLS)

Liquidity Mining

To incentivize participation in the daily token pools, we are launching a liquidity mining program
concurrent with the minimum viable product (MVP) launch in Q4 2020. This program will distribute a
fixed amount of tokens daily.

The way this distribution will work is simple. Let’s look at the initial Ethereum-based MVP. Everyday X
tokens will be distributed for all liquidity providers on a pro-rata basis. If there is a 1000 ETH swap
volume for 24 hours, a user that contributed with 100 ETH in volume will receive 10% of the total daily
liquidity rewards.

Liquidity providers can claim their reward after 24 hours and will have 7 days to claim their reward
tokens on the Polkastarter dashboard. Unclaimed tokens will be sent back to the rewards pool for
later distribution.

Tokens for liquidity mining will be taken from the Liquidity Pool. We are minting a total of 100,000,000
POLS and 22,500,000 (22.5%) will be destined for liquidity. Liquidity includes liquidity providing for
secondary markets, but also the liquidity mining rewards. Total liquidity mining rewards are yet to be
determined.

The exact reward structure will be revealed prior to the MVP launch and it’s going to include higher
rewards in the beginning and a gradual decrease in the daily reward over time.

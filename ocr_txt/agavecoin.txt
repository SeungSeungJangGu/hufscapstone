Although the possibilities for Biotechnological innovation
products offered by the Agave are significant, the supply of this
plant is still far from sufficient due to the fast-increasing demand
of Spirits . In 2017, more than 75% of the Agave was used for
Tequila and Mezcal and only the sub-products results of
distillation are Material used for prototype preparation by
research institutes, universities, and private enterprises. Every
day, new companies start investigating how they could use
Agave compunds to innovate new products. “SAGARPA
Research says the Agave market will grow to 2,012,000 Million
of Tons in 2030, from its 956,000 million tons in 2017. Other
experts are even more enthusiastic and forecast the value of the
global Agave market at $ 2.7 Billions USD by 2030 (Global

CHALLENGES

1. AGAVE DEMAND IN INCREASE

The US tequila industry, estimated at $ 2,6 Billion, will currently
face a severe supply crisis that is related to the production of agave
due to the strong increase in demand by 2030.

To supply the high demand on the agave industry, a strong capital
investment is needed for the programming, and Agave fields
maintenance.

2. MONOPOLISTIC PRACTICES AND SPECULATION
PRICES

In the specific case of the Agave production of Tequilana Weber,
there is a volatile history in the variation of prices and availability of
agave. These periods of ups and downs cause farmers to produce
agave when prices are high. the results, then, are an excess supply
of the plant, reduced prices and a direct impact on the profitability
of the producers, a cycle that has continued during the last 25 years
continues. this is due to monopolistic practices of the large
transnational companies that centralize a strong capital as well as
most of the profits of the industry

3. AGAVE PRODUCTS IN INCREASE

The progress of globalization has changed the agave Industry
Market massively, both in positive ways. One of the positive
changes is international acceptation that increase demand of spirits
and other Agave based products.

SOLUTIONS

1. AGAVE FIELDS INVESTMENT

AGAVECOIN SAPI allocates the use of hectares to the capital
investment , as land that may be turned to our expertise in the
production of Agave. The company has an initial inventory of 1
to 2000 hectares of land, used to showcase our production
habilities. this represents an average of between 10 to 15% of
the total agave production industry.

2. DECENTRALIZED ECONOMY

Our vision is to create the AgaveCoin® tokens as
cryptocurrency for a decentralized blockchain world. We
envision an ecosystem where people from around the globe can
participate in Agave fields .

The contracts for the future delivery of products will stabilize the
agave market and agave based products, since these crops as
well as their products, are traded internationally, the AgaveCoin
token as exchange currency, has no borders, therefore, it will
make it simpler and Quick these commercial exchanges. Using
the blockchain technology, an agave farmer who does business
with a tequila producer can create a contract and accept the
AgaveCoin token as payment for future deliveries, with prices,
agreements and established conditions, an entry will be created
in the blockchain and all the Other participants in the market will
be able to access this information in real time, which allows
democratization to fix prices.

3. INVESTMENT , AND TEQUILA PRODUCERS

The AgaveCoin® project will actively invest in a starting point
with destiladora Mexicana and other assets , with the goal of
such investments being leveraging this Tequila Producer and
Single Barrel Spirits as importer / whosaler both ways within the
alcohol sales channel to gain acceptance of agavecoin as
medium of exchange . thereafter, as acceptance grows the coin
will gain independence and attain value set by the market.

AgaveCoin SAPI

AgaveCoin® SAPI. is a company incorporated under the laws of Mexico, with a primary focus on the agriculture
sector. AgaveCoin ® SAPI operations are based in IRAPUATO GUANAJUATO MEXICO.

AgaveCoin® SAPI produces Agave using special infrastructure, designed with the cost-effective production
srategies, that includes providing the necessary amount of nutrients through water dossage and not directly from the
soil; thus preventing excessive use of fertilizers.

Its business model is based on acquiring low cost marginal underdeveloped and/or overused land that has no other

agricultural use, and where high poverty rates are common. Our strategy involves taking care of the extended
biological zone in the boundaries of the directly useful Agave fields, and tending to the restoration of local
microenvironments not favorable for agave, that are however interlinked to the fitness of agave plants.

This strategy is in line with the Agenda 21 strategy by the UN, and shall use Agave as a valuable crop that can be
used to curtail the effects of land desertificationred to procure the generation of AgaveCoin® tokens as a franchise
model is a hands-on business .

AgaveCoin® SAPI allocates the use of hectares to investors , as land that may be turned to our expertise in the
production of Agave. The company has an initial inventory of 1 to 2000 hectares of land, used to showcase our
production habilities. The infrastructure requi ore intensive than could be anticipated. In the business model,
investors are required to execute the application of working capital, attain to the everyday business needs and
schedules, and maintain constant communication with AgaveCoin® SAPI The franchise model has important
challenges, the main one to overcome is related to the distance and time of response for determinant decision-
making strategies. Therefore, the land is sometimes unattended at some low-production points. Yields and
economies of scale have not been put in place correctly. Traditional cultivation practices involve planting large
extensions of single crops with excess of irrigation and overproduction via overfertilization. AgaveCoin® tokens
foresees an opportunity to turn unproductive and eroded land, which is highly undervalued into a productive asset
through the efficient use of technology, understanding of biology, and authomation. Setting a cryptocurrency based
on Agave is thus a flagship opportunity for a renewal of the agroindustrial sector

9 AgaveCoin - White Paper - 2018
AgaveCoine Vision

Our vision is to create the AGAVECOIN® TOKENS as cryptocurrency for a decentralized
blockchain world. We envision an ecosystem where people from around the globe can participate
in Agave fields and processing agave projects in Mexico without having the expertise, time and
knowledge in the field.

Participation in our initiative will have a social by product of interest for ethical investors, i.e. helping
to abate the effects of desertification, the restoration of ecosystems and the emergence of a new
ecology linked to financial interests. Through time and sheer determination we will become a
leading Agave Industry.

The production of Agave, as the making of spirits and many other products relies directly on the
quality of the raw ingredients and of artisanal and cultural traditions carefully tuned to perfection.
There is however a move towards merging traditional ways with modern infrastructure
developments. Our goal is to link from basic science (biophysics and biology), agriculture,
authomation, information technology and finance in a truly vissionary manner that is poised to yield
exceptional dividends.

This next wave in the way companies, technologies and people interact relative to one another is
likely to be more transformative than any previous industrial revolution we have seen so far. People
will be able to deploy resources to projects they believe in without the need to interact with
middlemen, government bureaucracy or corruption. We believe that by deploying these resources
effectively we can change the course of migration, social development and employment in these
much-needed rural towns.

AgaveCoins Objetives

AgaveCoin®

Presents a solution without intermediaries for trade, payment, and transaction for agricultural products and services used
in the production of alcoholic beverages.

We outline the difficulties International tequila and mezcal brands, and other agave products, owners face when
attempting to purchase alcohol from Mexican manufacturers, who often modify tequila prices based on both the supply
availability and price fluctuations of agave—the main agricultural product used in the production of tequila.

We outline the solution for this production issue with the use of “smart contracts”, whereby brand owners in the US and/or
their producers of tequila in Mexico, can set the price of the delivery of agave, using the AgaveCoin® token

We address the scalability issue through the power of AgaveCoin® , which will have a significant impact on this industry
due to the subcontracting-hub nature of tequila’s market transaction techniques. Indeed, much of the market is based on
one tequila producer’s paradigm in Mexico, who serves as a subcontractor for multiple US brands. (TEQUILA
SOLORZANO®, TEQUILA CANICAS® , TEQUILA COPITA® , TEQUILAACUMBARO® , MEZCAL TROSKY®, ) Thus,
the acquisition or adoption of AgaveCoin® Tokens by a single manufacturer can impact a significant portion of the market
and thus foster the control of multimillions of dollars in trade. Fourth, we outline a strategy of execution that will allow
AgaveCoin® to build confidence, acceptance, and value, in addition to providing social services through the purchase
and operation of assets within the industry.

we set forth our agenda for the token’s issuance, describing how AgaveCoin® will be dispersed in a manner that builds
valuation from the Simple Agreement for Future Token (SAFT) pre-sale to a free-trading medium of exchange where
pricing is decided by the marketplace. Lastly, we outline the AgaveCoin® community and summarize both what
AgaveCoin® has to offer investors and the potential of blockchain to power the Agave Industry and boost social -
economic development of third world communities in Mexico.

Agave Industry and the Blockchain Tech.

AgaveCoin® An entry on the blockchain would be created and all other market participants could access that information
in real time. This would establish a comprehensive network for price accuracy information and thus add an element of
efficiency to the agave market. A US brand owner who wishes to purchase tequila could, then, aptly factor in cost with a
planned round of production.

The brand owner could also create a smart contract directly with an agave farm to lock in given prices for future
deliveries. Futures contracts and pricing information can become tools for farm owners who want to factor in costs when
planning their planting activities and bring market stability to a region that has been fraught with price swings and
boom-and-bust periods—where the lack of information needed to conduct planning has led to inefficiencies in both
production and manufacturing. Indeed, producers and growers can optimize their relationships and increase wealth
distribution. For example, one producer could work with at least 10 or more brand owners.

The introduction of such efficiencies could translate into an industry-wide adoption of new and improved business
practices. In short, the alcohol industry, specifically tequila, is an area that will greatly benefit from such innovation and
leave an open field for greater efficiency, transparency, and price management that blockchain and other technologies
provide.

AgaveCoin® is a token created by the Ethereum ERC20 platform, designed to serve as a medium of exchange for
various agricultural futures contracts. Currently, its value is derived from shares of AGAVECOIN ® SAP] . and its assets.
As acceptance grows, however, the coin will gain independence and attain value set by the marketplace. AGAVECOIN
SAPI.’S ® goal, then, is to position itself as not just an owner, but an operator of various concerns within both the agave
growth segment and the tequila production industry. Owning our own agave fields will allow AgaveCoin® to become a
contract fulfillment foundation for futures trading operations, shore up confidence in the system, and ensure that any
parties who have not fulfilled their contractual obligations can rely upon AgaveCoin® to meet those needs. This position
will also allow AgaveCoin® to accelerate the usage and growth of its token as a medium of adaptable exchange. In
addition, the transparency of blockchain will position AgaveCoin® to have influence on the market, price information, and
business practices—all of which will assist the market in its ability to self-regulate and promote contracts that are less
volatile. This will also ensure that investors are diversified for long-term market sustainability. Thus, AgaveCoin® aims to
become a kind of default “market maker’ for prices of the underlying agricultural product, thereby assisting in providing
stability to an unpredictable marketplace.

1 ia AgaveCoin - White Paper - 2018
AgaveCoin® The above represents a system of providing a medium of exchange for transactions for tequila producers
and agave farmers. AgaveCoin creates a permanent transaction, by which a good—in this case, agave—can be
produced and delivered based upon a blockchain entry that the general public can assess. The market can utilize this
information to produce the following resolutions:

- International Tequila and Mezcal buyers can eliminate potential fears related to wire transactions or dealing with
Mexico's banking institutions.
-The buyer can be assured the producer will not attempt to renegotiate prices and terms, because smart contracts cannot
be changed and are accessible by the general public.
-The Mexico-based seller will have a measurable contract and an agreed-upon price for delivery.
-The seller will have a reliable form of payment, which is subject to scrutiny by the greater community.
-Other industry participants will have a basis to form contractual relationships in price terms.
-The practice of farmers entering into negotiations with multiple buyers, only to deliver to the highest bidder, will be
eliminated via transparency.

AGAVECOIN® SAPI. will acquire the necessary assets to become a supplier of agave, and with AgaveCoin token
meeting commitments of farmers who do not fulfill their contractual obligations, and provide a better system of conducting
business throughout the industry. Standards can only be established based upon common knowledge; the transparency
of blockchain empowers market participants with real-time information and data.

AGVC - These tokens constitute a digital asset, where the main use-case, and the reason for the contributors to buy
the tokens, is the possible anticipation of value appreciation. The AGVC token is an ERC-20, compliant token. ERC
stands for Ethereum Request for Comment and is a technical standard used for smart contracts on the Ethereum
blockchain for implementing tokens. These tokens are blockchain assets that can have value and can be sent and
received, like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, or any other cryptocurrency, like AGVC.

We will ensure price stability by encouraging token holders to temporarily lock up tokens. Our legal experts are in the
process of putting in place all compliance for Mexican and other international laws. The Whitepaper will be updated

AGVC Value Perspective The supply of AGVC tokens is limited, and as the Agave market is expected to increase from
1.5 billion dollars in 2017 to 2.7 billion dollars by 2025, we envision a significant growth in its value. Taking into
consideration that the average price per kilogram of Agave is now $1.2 USD, this price can will decrease or increase
while the value of AGVC token will increase over time due to our performance and possible diversification of usability,
meaning that the purchasing power of the AGVC holders will be multiplied compared to buyers paying in dollars. At this

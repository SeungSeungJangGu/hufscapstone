A NOTE FROM DANEEL'’S FOUNDER

First of all, thank you for your interest in Daneel. I hope that this

document will enlighten you about our vision and our project.

Daneel is born from the passion of its creators for Blockchain and
cryptocurrency, in a changing world, one in which the two technologies

have a real role to play.

Our role is to democratize cryptocurrency in order to make it more
accessible to mass market investors, by proposing a thoughtful and

innovative solution for them.

We are aware of the bad publicity linked to the notion of an ICO (Initial
Coin Offering) over previous months, mainly due to a lack of reliability
in certain projects. That’s why, even though the legislative framework is
still developing, we were determined to respect all basic responsibilities
in legislation, security and information. We hope that you will therefore
see this as guarantee of reliability, and that you will believe in us and in

Daneel.

We welcome your comments and suggestions at the email address
joseph @daneel.io.

Enjoy your reading and see you soon,

FosePh Bedmwynster

INTRODUCTION TO BLOCKCHAIN AND TO
CRYPTOCURRENCY

Blockchain: a revolution in the making

A real, innovative tool which is about to profoundly transform our societies as well
as the relationships between individuals, organizations and states, Blockchain
represents a chain of “blocks” (digital containers) where information of all sorts is

stored: transactions, contracts, title deeds, works of art...

This set of blocks form a database similar to the pages of a great accounts book,

known as a “register”, which is itself hosted by a group of network users.

Unlike the centralized system that currently governs our societies, Blockchain

primarily allows users to get away from a centralized body or a third party.

At the heart of this system, special users called “miners” have the role of ensuring
the validity of transactions by providing the entire network with the computing

power of their computers.

Once the algorithm has completed its validation exercise, all users of Blockchain
can simply verify that the exercise is correct; then, when a large majority of
Blockchain users have validated the computing operation, the block is added to

the chain and the transactions that it contains are considered valid.
Blockchain therefore includes the following advantageous characteristics:

¢ Security: The decentralized framework and the blocks’ codes guarantee the

absolute security of the information.

¢ Disintermediation: The concept of “consensus” replaces any of centralized

validation.

« Autonomy: The creation of cryptocurrency covers the costs of the

infrastructure involved.

WWW.DANEEL1|O 6

WHITEPAPER

By this revolutionary principle, Blockchain is on the brink of causing a profound

upheaval to all sectors of the economy, and many related projects have already

begun.

What is cryptocurrency?

+
M,

Each Blockchain is associated with a
cryptocurrency (also called a token). The
most well-known is the Bitcoin, a currency
invented by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008.

Today, there are several hundred

different digital currencies.

They all share the common trait of being
a virtual means of exchange, not based in
any single state, as opposed to the Dollar

or the Euro. They circulate via peer-to-

peer networks, based on cryptographic algorithms, and are not necessarily

intended as a payment system between users.

The number of units in circulation and the maximum money supply are defined in

advance and visible to all. Until proven otherwise, cryptocurrency cannot be

counterfeited or stolen.

It is possible today to define several separate families of cryptocurrency, which are

adapted to the objectives of the communities who use them:

= “Infrastructure” currency: the type of currency likely to bring about the

most profound changes, whose ambition goes far beyond being a simple

means of payment, and which has the objective of offering a real alternative

to the existing financial system.

Examples: Ethereum, NXT, Ripple...

WWW.DANEELIO | 7
daneel & WHITEPAPER

= “Social” currency: currency created to allow the easy exchange of small
financial amounts between web users (“social tipping”), on existing social

networks in particular.

«= Alternative currency: broadly inspired by Bitcoin, these currencies
attempt, via technical innovation, to function either more easily, more
securely or more rapidly, for example by reducing transaction verification

times.

o Examples: Litecoin, Digibyte...

= Anonymous currency: currency created solely to serve as a purely
anonymous means of payment, protecting both the user’s identity as well

as their transactions.

o Examples: Monero, Bytecoin...

Exchanging cryptocurrency; a speculative
investment

Cryptocurrencies are primarily an investment of potential
profitably.

These alternative digital currencies represent, in effect, a new
kind of investment intrinsically linked with our modern digital

economy.

While extremely volatile, they can demonstrate impressive
financial performances:

Bitcoin exceeded a rate of 6,000 USD in October 2017, despite being traded at a
rate of 434 USD in January 2016!

Indeed, it’s because of cryptocurrency’s speculative nature that it attracts
investors, who generally appreciate the risky characteristics of this kind of market.
Speculation is rampant in the universe of cryptocurrency, not only in regards to
rate variation against the dollar, but also regarding the financial operations that

cryptocurrencies finance.

WWW.DANEELIO | 8
daneel & WHITEPAPER

Many investors are also in search of an asset to provide diversification to their
portfolio, and thus invest a small proportion of their assets with a view towards a
long-term gain. Cryptocurrency can effectually provide for the needs of investors

seeking to diversify their risks by turning toward alternative investments.

Accessing reactive and reliable sources of
information; a strategic challenge for the
cryptocurrency investor

A major concern for every investor, having access to a comprehensive, reliable
and rapid source of information is a fundamental part of the decision-making

process in cryptocurrency investing.

With the development of the digital world and the increasing
“datafication” of our society, information is becoming more
and more immediately accessible to every individual, through
exchange platforms, social media, specialized print media,
television programs, groups of influencers, word of mouth and

more.
Not a day goes by without being flooded with information!

In the face of such an inundation of data, investors will inevitably encounter a

number of difficulties.

WWW.DANEELIO | 9
daneel & WHITEPAPER

Cross-referencing sources and analysing content to access reliable

information

Rumours and conflicting or manipulated information can significantly influence the

purchase and sale of cryptocurrency for numerous investors.

In fact, for many years digital and interactive means have bit by bit taken over all
classic forms of communication media and non-media, and the Internet has come

to be completely integrated in corporate marketing campaigns.

Furthermore, the development of social networks
favouring interaction between web users in an often
anonymous manner has led each individual to post more
and more often, unavoidably leading to an increase in

«misinformation». The Internet has thus become social,

movable and participative... and today one tweet from an
influential individual may have more of an impact on cryptocurrency rates than the

actions of institutions themselves!

So, to what extent can information concerning cryptocurrency be biased? How can
reliability be ensured, so that the plethora of online information a user encounters

does not jeopardize every one of their investments?

Capturing the right information at the right time, amongst all

available data

As an investor, the search for reliable information often resembles a complex
quest: how can we identify the limited number of good resources? How can we
sort them out? How can we interpret this information in order to make informed

decisions?

WWW.DANEELIO | 10
daneel & WHITEPAPER

In addition, while certain investors may benefit from a lack of information, others
feel «overwhelmed» by the flow of available data and will inevitably find

themselves exposed to an overabundance of information.

This phenomenon of overexposure will result in an alteration in decision-making

and a decline in investment performance.

Information encountered about investments needs to be sufficient without

becoming overwhelming, as well as easy and practical to use.

Capturing the emotions of the market

The sheer amount of information available renders each investor more vulnerable

to emotion when investing.

« Fear of Missing Out » (FOMO), « Panic sell », « Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt »
(FUD), are several examples of the phenomena that can negatively influence the

ability of investors to manage their emotions while making decisions.

This poor emotional management then leads to ill-thought-out short-term actions,
including sudden changes in trading and investment strategies, and the following

of unfounded trends... often at the expense of invested capital.

Benefiting from an appropriate level of knowledge and

comprehension around cryptocurrency

Understanding the details of Blockchain and cryptocurrency, learning to trade,
mastering the fundamentals... these are some of the many topics that each

investor should know and understand. But where can this information be found?

WWW.DANEELIO } 11
daneel & WHITEPAPER

The various tutorials available on the Internet come with a relatively high price
tag, and are often not sufficiently adapted to an individual’s personal level.

The difficulty in managing multiple cryptocurrency
portfolios

Investors in cryptocurrency generally invest through exchange platforms chosen
based on:

¢ The number of cryptocurrencies listed

¢ The volume of exchanges present

¢« The fees charged by the platform

¢ The level of security and reliability

¢ The design and ergonomics

Therefore, it often happens that an investor is obliged to use several platforms to
buy and sell the currencies they are interested in.

Managing these different platforms often involves multiple restrictions for the
investor: difficulty in following investment performances, using different
currencies, slowness of services, two-step connections to platforms, managing
multiple sets of login details, risking error during transfers between platforms... as
many situations within this sector require a high level of responsiveness, this set

up may prove dire for the investor.

Our objective

7 i

To design the first intelligent personal assistant who

can accompany you in the daily management of

cryptocurrency.

WWW.DANEELIO | 13
daneel & WHITEPAPER

Limits of existing personal assistant services

Assistants (or “bots”) currently available on the market have many notable

functional and technological limitations.

The present solutions are effectively confined to supplying information (the rate of
a cryptocurrency, information on the launch of an ICO, newspaper articles...)
through different channels of communication like Facebook and its “Messenger”

application, through “Slack” or even through “Telegram”.

Their use is also rarely user-friendly, as they often necessitate using predefined
commands to carry out simple requests, based around the recognition of set key
words (« What is the price of BTC? »).

These solutions respond only to a basic need, using primitive artificial intelligence

systems that are not able to:
= Understand and interpret natural human language
= Analyse and select the most reliable information available

= Interact in a relevant way, in order to communicate the right trend at the

right time

WWW.DANEELIO |} 14
daneet WHITEPAPER
Our solution

As we are fully aware of the limitations of these previous solutions, we’d like to
suggest an assistant of a new kind: a personal assistant based on Watson, one of
the most efficient artificial intelligences in the market, who will be responsible for

providing daily assistance in the world of cryptocurrency.
Through this, you will have ready access to an intelligent counsellor able to:
= Understand and interact with you

= Keep you informed in real time, with quality information that he gathered and

analysed himself
= Identify and capture the different emotions of the market
= Alert you as soon as one of your investments is in jeopardy

= Facilitate easy portfolio follow-up and management, as well as ease of sales

and purchases.
= Provide daily advice on your investments and on market trends

= Provide personally-tailored indicators

This is the objective we have set for ourselves, and you can help us to develop it.

What type of investor is Daneel suited for?
Daneel is not intended to address professional investors, particularly those already
involved in trading rooms. Indeed, these investors often rely on specialized and

costly technologies, often developed and jealously guarded by banks.

On the contrary, we want to democratize access to artificial intelligence for

investors by offering our technology to non-professionals.

WWW.DANEELIO | 15
daneel & WHITEPAPER

To do this, we have identified three mass-market investor profiles: beginner,

intermediate and advanced users.

WWW.DANEELIO | 16
daneel & WHITEPAPER

TECHNOLOGICAL ASPECTS

The main technological stakes

In order for Daneel to meet all the objectives that we have set, we will have to

address several factors on a daily basis.

Make full use of the power of « Natural Language Understanding »

Daneel will need to be able to understand your queries
every time you turn to him, regardless of spelling or

sentence structure.

We will have to be confident of the ability of the system to
analyse and understand the meaning of human language,

to perceive emotions and to correctly perform the relevant

actions.

Guarantee the reliability of the information analysed and proposed

by Daneel

How can we, in a world with a huge amount of sources of information (online
newspapers, forums, social networks, expert networks, exchange platforms...)
determine which sources are reliable, so that information used is sure to be

trustworthy and free from manipulation?

We currently make use of the superior skills of the Blockchain sector, of specialized

journalists, and of specialized counsellors to bring together different informational

WWW.DANEELIO | 17
daneel & WHITEPAPER

references. The goal is to categorize these, and then to determine reliability, as

well as which the method to employ for each source.

To gather together the mass of information within a sector
is the first step, but to analyse it is another one entirely. To
provide the requisite intelligence to the service, it will be
necessary to perfect the algorithm developed during the

prototype design, in order to consider all flows of

information, and give only the most suitable and reliable

information to the user.

Offer personalized advice, adapted to the needs of each non-
professional investor profile

As a personal assistant, we want to make Daneel as personalised as possible for
each user. We would like to make each experience unique, and aim to place Daneel
in a position to provide the best possible advice to the user. Our primary objective
is user satisfaction. That’s why we have created the profiles of «novice user»,
«intermediate user» and of «experienced user». Every user will therefore be able
to take advantage of all the features they require, while receiving an experience

tailored to their level, and to their expectations regarding information and control.

Ensure the security of all data

How can we ensure the safety of your information? How can we limit the risk of

hacking attempts by outside third parties?

Important safety measures should be established between the user and the Daneel
ecosystem. The mobile application, as well as the web platform, will have to
address important safety constraints and will therefore be frequently audited by

external services and partners.

As for the architecture, it must be hosted and secured by the world’s leading

specialists in the cloud and IT security.

WWW.DANEELIO | 18
daneel & WHITEPAPER

Our teams will endeavour to monitor the functioning of all services, as well as
questions asked and answers delivered, in order to ensure the reliability of

exchanges with the API of our ecosystem, and those of our partners.

Relying on best practice in terms of ergonomics and design

We attach great importance to offering the best user experience throughout the

use of the Daneel service.

To do this, we’d like to refer to the best practices used in ergonomics and design

during the development of each both the web and mobile interfaces, and commit

to an approach centred completely on the user.

Presentation of Daneel's features

STAY INFORMED

Gather, aggregate and analyse information

The concept of curating is at the heart of Daneel.

To begin, Daneel searches, browses, collects and analyses
different sources of information available from various online
channels: news feeds, general media, specialized media and

social networks.

Once the information is collected, he sorts and categorizes all relevant data in

order to only offer information deemed to be highly reliable.
You will then see in real time a summary of all necessary information concerning:

= The current rates of all your specified cryptocurrencies
= Cryptocurrency news sorted by theme (technological, legal, partnerships...).

= Different « Initial Coin Offering » operations available

Analyse the Emotions of the Market
In addition to analysing and summarizing information, we wish to allow Daneel to
analyse the emotions of the market using a « Social Emotion Indicator » function.

Our artificial intelligence collects messages posted on social networks, then
analyses them and conveys to the user the predominant online sentiments

surrounding the cryptocurrency of their choice.

In this way, you can more easily detect <pump» or growing doubt surrounding a

cryptocurrency, and be up-to-date for every decision you make.

WWW.DANEELIO | 20

Feelings analysis

Thanks to ¥ IBM Watson, Daneel is able to analyze all the feeds (news, twitter, reddit, ...),
and determine the general sentiment of the market about a currency.

In addition, you can also benefit from indicators which identify which currencies
are the most cited in news sources and on social networks, as well as those most

searched on Google.

Define a Cryptocurrency Confidence Score

Our artificial intelligence will use a specially developed
algorithm to calculate a « Confidence score »., by analysing
currency rates, recent events, and the perceived emotions of

users on social networks.

This score, given out of 10, will reflect the reliability of a

currency at a given moment.

It will give investors a good idea of the risk involved in an investment.

After the ICO, we will burn 60% of all the unsold tokens and redistribute
40% of them proportionally to all our investors.

Unsold tokens : What are the advantages of this distribution model?

1. As you might already know, the burning process allows a diminution of the total
supply on the market and potentially contribute to an appreciation of the token price

2. This new distribution model allows our community to continue dominating the market
with 56% of the Tokens holders.

3. This new distribution model guarantee the liquidity on the market and the scalability
of the project as our token will be the only way to subscribe and use Daneel’s service.

" 7.5% of tokens, that is 7 500 OOO, will be preserved in reserve by the
company.

These tokens could be sold in the future, by lots, in the case of the company

needing supplementary funds to cover expenditure linked to service

development. Tokens will be held in Multisignature wallet. Their sale, as well

as the underlying objective, will be announced in advance on the Company's

official website.

= 20% of tokens, that is 20 OOO OOO, will be distributed to stakeholders

(global team, counsellors, community) that have contributed actively to the
success of the operation.

These tokens will be stored in a Multisignature wallet. If a member of the

team wants to sell its tokens, the transactions will require the signatures of

multiple team members before the funds can be _ transferred.

This process will allow the team to control the impacts on the token price.

OVERVIEW

The MINDOL project aims to revitalize

Japanese subculture worldwide

Japanese government recently has raised a reconstruction strategy, a
promotion of the “COOL Japan strategy," as one of the major strategy to
reconstruct Japanese economy.

Japan's subculture is commonly referred to as "geek culture" or “otaku
culture.” It is now well-known throughout the whole world with the spread of
the Internet, and it became a powerful content of “cool Japan” . According
to Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry survey, the market size of the
content industry such as Japanese movies, animation, TV programs, music,
games etc. is said to be about 12 trillion yen. However, this is only for the
domestic market. It is also said that the scale of the market spreading on a
global scale is tens of times that.

For example, more than 230,000 visitors from all over the Europe come to
"Japan Expo," a festival of Japanese culture which is held every year in
France and other countries as well. Japanese subculture is now becoming
famous every year that even Stephen Spielberg, who came to Japan this
year excitedly mentioned that the "Japan's pop culture is my favorite, the
best |"

Based on such global trends, the MINDOL Project will be creating new
contents in the fields of “Cool Japant” - subculture and pop culture such as
animation, movies, games, cartoons, and music. In addition, we will manage

and operate the project safely and securely, using blockchain technology.

MINDOL is the new currency for the world of “subculture market” .

BLOCKCHAIN

In this project, in order to realize eMINDOL, we adopt blockchain technology that

can secure high transparency and reliability on the Internet.

Blockchain technology is a distributed ledger technology built on the network and
is a secure and highly transparent technology for recording service records that
can be applied besides settlement of virtual currency.

Since it is more robust, persistent, transparent, and dispersive than management
by conventional databases, it is attracting attention in recent years as a record
book that guarantees and certifies the authenticity of transactions and contents.

"Data tampering Difficult data recording technology ".

In the blockchain, records of transactions occurring in the network are stored in
chunks of records called "blocks". In addition to recording the transaction, each
block stores information called a hash value indicating the contents of the block
generated immediately before. It is a data structure in which the generated blocks
connect like chains along the time series. If you try to tamper somewhere in the
block generated in the past, you will have to change the hash value of all
subsequent blocks, so you can not change in practice. For this reason, the
eMINDOL platform using the block chain has a very excellent data structure for
tamper resistance, so it will be a platform that will gain trust from not only users

but also creators and related companies.

In addition, there are other benefits of using blockchain technology with eMINDOL.
By using blockchains, since there are many distributed ledgers, there is no fear of
server down and hacking is impossible, so the need for server maintenance and
security measures can be reduced. Furthermore, the transaction cost and time
can also be done smoothly worldwide compared with the conventional approval
system. Transactions are verified under the public view, so that it is possible to
transfer money quickly and safely without the existence of a trusted third party

and to reduce transaction costs and time.

On the eMINDOL platform, settlement and donation by MINDOL token,
participation type voting function, digital ticket management after purchasing
event tickets, copyright management are carried out using such blockchain
technology.

The development application program of this project is panned to be shared on
Github.

White paper v2.5.1 | © 2019 Tap N Go limited | All rights reserved
Abstract

Tap is the one stop shop for
anyone involved, or looking
to get involved, with Crypto.

Predominantly, Tap is an exchange app
which will let you trade on major crypto
exchanges within the Tap app. With one
KYC (Know Your Customer) process you
can trade any supported crypto asset
on any major exchange. Complete any
trade with a touch of a button and, due
to the unique way Tap provides liquidity,
your trade is executed and fulfilled
instantaneously. Tap provides a seamless
link with modern banking facilities and
major crypto exchanges. New customers
can come on-board for free with fiat or
cryptocurrencies.

The Tap app comes with a free Tap
Prepaid Mastercard linked to your
account. Choose any crypto asset that
you hold in Tap to fund any card purchase
with your Tap Prepaid Mastercard. The Tap
token can be used for discounted fees

or staked for better card and user terms.
With monthly Tap token burns (see page
20), Tap token holders will benefit from
increased token exclusivity.

Development of the Tap app and
infrastructure has been underway for
around 2 years. We aim to launch the app
at the end of the token sale around the
same time as the TGE. Our aim is to have
a fully functioning product with XTP token
utility inside the app in 2nd quarter of 2019.
Laid out in this whitepaper is how we will
deliver an app and token with this much
functionality.

Whois
Tap for?

With an intuitive user interface
and broad access to crypto
exchanges, the Tap app will
make buying and trading
cryptocurrencies far more
accessible than previously
possible.

In time, Tap will become the familiar
solution for the entire sector as it will
provide unrivalled broad access to
tradable cryptocurrencies, whilst
simultaneously making them spendable
through the Tap card.

Taps proprietary middleware does all the
hard work for the Tap user. Constantly
scanning the prices of crypto trading
pairs across major exchanges as well as
crypto-to-fiat pairs, it will find the best
price available with any combination.
The middleware can do this across major
exchanges and supported currencies,
meaning that as Taps user base
increases, inefficiencies in the market will
be eliminated.

Yet, for the Tap user, they will just
experience being shown the best price
for their trade. Tap believe in one trusted,
instinctive and all-encompassing portal
where anyone can store, manage and
spend any fiat or crypto asset.

White paper v2.5.1 | © 2019 Tap N Go limited | All rights reserved

=

1Transaction limits will be dictated by our card issuer.

2 Tap will start with three crypto currencies and three fiat
currencies, however, the aim is to quickly add more and
even further down the road be able to support all fiat
currencies and all major exchanges.

Additionally, we deliver all this with a Tap
Prepaid Mastercard for your convenience,
allowing users to use any asset to pay for
anything, be it a coffee or a holiday. Tap
aims to breakdown financial borders and
allow any user to send any fiat or crypto
asset to anyone, anywhere in the world for
free (subject to terms and conditions’),
and to have that asset instantly available
to spend.

We believe our vision is vital to mass

adoption of blockchain currencies and is
what the crypto sector is crying out for.

1.1

Who Is tap for?
The new investor

Anyone who has introduced
a friend to crypto knows what
an alien process it can be on
their first time.

They go to a site to buy BTC (for a high
commission), then if they want to buy any
other currency, they need to set up an
exchange account and become familiar
with the process immediately.

They need to understand wallets, how

to make a transfer, place an order (and
ensure the order is fulfilled). Often, the
new investor also needs a separate wallet
as some exchanges co not let you hold
funds. Each stage of the process attracts
fees, transaction costs and commissions
(including hidden costs such as spreads).

Costs compared to Coinbase when
instantly buying $1000 of BTC.

Coinbase TAP

1.5%

3.99%

For the new investor there is no process
as simple and transparent as Tap.

White paper v2.5.1 | © 2019 Tap N Go limited | All rights reserved

With TAP, after a simple registration
and KYC process, a new investor can
fund their account with a bank transfer
(as they are provided with a sort code,
account number, IBAN and reference)

or debit card payment for free. Once
funded, they can buy any supported
cryptocurrency at a spot rate fora
maximum fee of 1.5% through the app
at a touch of a button and hold crypto
in their balance.

1.2
Who Is tap for?

The familiar investor

Even investors who are familiar
with the buying process still face
frustrations when managing
their crypto assets.

They suffer the same problems and
costs as the new investor, with additional
problems when they want to move from
an alternative currency (ALT1) to another
alternative currency (ALT2). Currently,

the investor needs to sell ALT] into BTC

(or ETH) before buying ALT2 with the
acquired BTC (or ETH). They may also
need to move funds from one exchange
to another to complete the trade. Fees
and commissions are charged on each
transaction and, depending on the selling
strategy, can take time to fill and require
close management.

With Tap, a customer can complete AND
fulfil any trade in under three seconds.
Even when this trade is performed across
exchanges! Any supported currency (fiat
or crypto) can be used to purchase any
other supported currency at a spot rate
and fulfilment is instant’.

White paper v2.5.1 | © 2019 Tap N Go limited | All rights reserved

The investor can continue his day
without closely managing two trades.
There is currently no exchange that
offers instant ALT to ALT fulfilment
combined with cross exchange/
currency arbitrage‘ to ensure the best
possible price.

3 Instant fulfilment. Tap will hold sufficient liquidity pools
in every crypto and fiat currency that supports all the
major exchanges. This means that if someone wanted to
make a trade across exchanges (e.g. sell ALT on Exchange
1to buy ALT2 on Exchange 2), Tap will use its liquidity pool
to complete both sides of the trade on each exchange.
This will leave the liquidity pool temporarily imbalanced
until a backend reconciliation is complete, whereby funds
are moved out of the user's cold storage and back to the
relevant exchanges. The middleware also reads the order
books of all exchanges so that when it delivers the price
to the customer, it is specified that the trade will complete
instantly (as those orders are waiting to be filled).

4 The middleware will search every combination to
complete a trade. Therefore, when performing an Alt 1to
Alt 2 trade, all possible combinations of fiat and crypto
pairings will be calculated, essentially searching for
inefficiencies in the market that would benefit our users in
terms of getting them a better price.

This raises two concerns for the crypto
adopter. The first is security. When much
of your wealth is digital, you need to
know it is secure. Tap eliminates security
concerns by storing all customer assets
in multi-signatory cold/offline storage,
widely considered the highest level of
protection (for more on security, see
section on page XX).

The second concern is day-to-day utility
of crypto assets for spending. Currently, if
the adopter wants to free up crypto assets
for purchases or bills, you need to sell your
asset into BTC, then sell BTC to fund your
bank account.

Getting the best commission rates
requires minimum transaction sizes, which
may mean selling more of your crypto
asset than you wish and missing out on
possible gains if your crypto asset value
increases. Additionally, each transaction
incurs costs.

Who Is tap for?
The international traveller

Whether a regular traveler or
not, we all suffer from punitive
exchange rates and/or bank fees.

Some traveler cards are available, but
none have the versatility of Tap and offer
such favorable terms.

Tap currently supports three fiat
currencies with more to be added shortly.
Any traveler can now convert fiat, or any
supported crypto asset, into their desired
currency at the touch of a button. With fiat
to fiat conversions, any Tap customer can
do this for free, up to a minimum of £1000°
(depending on card level) a month and is
only charged 0.5% after that®.

Take your Tap card abroad and avoid
banking charges and unfavorable

commission spreads. (Please note: Tap
card is topped for you by Tap, so there is
no need to manually top up your card).

5 The allowances are based on which TAP card level.
There are three possible levels which give allowances of
£1000, £3000 or unlimited free currency transfers. More
information on cards can be found on page xx.

6 The Tap card is a Prepaid Mastercard, however, when
keeping assets in your wallet or a fiat balance, this is

not loaded onto the card. Therefore, you can take your
prepaid card abroad. When you use your card, Tap has
already prepaid it and will only approve transactions after
checking your balance, when using your TAP card abroad.

How tap works

Any seasoned crypto investor
is familiar with the laborious
KYC processes when setting up
multiple exchange accounts.

Soon, that will become a thing of the
past as every major crypto exchange
can be accessed through a single app.

This brings several advantages to the
crypto investor:

3.1

Exchange any alternative
cryptocurrency without
having to move funds from
one exchange to another.

Find the best market price
instantly on your phone.

All your crypto assets are

kept in one safe place that
you can view anytime.

Taps proprietary middleware
makes this possible

Tap will hold accounts with every
exchange and scan their order books

to find the best price. It then delivers the
best price through the Tap app. With just
one click youll be able to exchange any
crypto asset from one exchange to any
crypto asset on any other exchange,
completely eliminating the need to
move assets across exchanges.

Access to the order books of major crypto
exchanges ensures customers receive the
best possible price. Similarly, through Taps
FX provider, the same process takes place
when using fiat currency. As Tap will link

all exchanges and have an FX provider,
the middleware will perform arbitrage
across currencies or exchanges on behalf
of the customer. The user can see the rate
charged and, if happy, can proceed via
the app.*

*Sometimes, the same asset can have a different price depending on the exchange. This is caused by liquidity issues or general
market inefficiencies. Exchange/currency arbitrage is when every possible variation of a trade, be it through different crypto
assets or fiat currencies, is calculated to provide the best price for the customer.

www.tap.global
3.2

Taps hot wallets
and liquidity pool

TAP holds balances with exchanges and with our electronic money
issuer Transact Payments to facilitate instant fulfilment. This allows the
middleware to execute any trades instantly without having to wait for
funds to be moved. Now, any trade can be completed and fulfilled in
less than 3 seconds and card purchases are possible with converted
crypto assets.

3.3

Taps cold storage of
customer assets

Tap keeps all customer assets in offline/cold storage behind a multi-
signature wallet with the highest grade security. This gives customers
peace of mind that their assets are secure. Transactions are run through
the hot wallets/liquidity pool, with funds adjusted in the customer's

cold storage account to return funds to the liquidity pool. With our
partnership with BitGo, we have our cold storage insured for up to $IOOM

Using ETH to pay for

The process:

Robert checks his GBP balance on his TAP App and
sees that he does not have enough GBP for the
transaction

Robert decides to exchange some of his ETH to
pay for the jacket

The middleware searches all exchanges to find
the best GBP/ETH price for the customer’.

Robert presents his card at the vendors terminal
and the transaction is authorised against the
balance in his Card Wallet

The ETH/GBP trade exchange rate is presented to
Robert and once accepted is executed and the
backend reconciliation process will take place.
GBP will be taken from the exchange to replenish
the GBP taken from Tap’s liquidity pool (held with
the card provider). ETH is returned to the exchange
from Taps liquidity pool, returning the exchange
balance to its original state.

ETH is taken from the customer's account in cold
storage and returned to the central liquidity pool
so that all of Taps liquidity pools are returned to
their original state, leaving only the customer's
cold storage account in debit.

A notification is sent to Robert as a receipt, letting
him know the final cost of his jacket in GBP’.

White paper v2.5.1 | © 2019 Tap N Go limited | All rights reserved

As Tap’s liquidity pool
holds multiple fiat
currencies, Robert could
have done this same
transactionin any fiat
currency. Meaning that
it would have been just
as easy to buy the jacket
abroad in the skiing
resort. In time, Tap token
investors and holders will
benefit from additional
economies of scale.

As volumes grow, Tap
will have the ability to

execute both sides of the

transaction — especially
in popular pairings. This
will avoid the need to pay
exchange fees, thereby
increasing margins
which can be passed on
to the user. There will be
no visible difference to
the Tap user.

7 Robert can check the ETH spot price
just before he makes the purchase.
The price quoted to him at that time
will be the price that can be executed.
However, this price might not be the
exact price that the transaction is
settled at, due to the market moving
up or down between checking the
price and presenting the card. The
customer accepts the changes in
price, however, as the transactions
are performed instantly, any change
in price will be minimal.

By way of backend reconciliation, the FX provider

in return sends EUR back to the liquidity pool, thus
returning the balance held with the FX provider
back to its original state.

GBP are taken from Robert's cold storage

How tap
earns fees

One of the key drivers of user
growth will be that fiat banking
and card services are free of
charge with Tap.

Tap generates fees when
cryptocurrencies are bought or sold,
including when using

a crypto asset to fund a fiat card
purchase.

The fee for any crypto transaction will be
between 0.5% and 1.5% depending on the
type of transaction, the more popular
the exchange pairing the lower the
transaction fee. Users can opt to pay the
fee in Tap tokens, which as we'll explain ; ;
a little later, gives the user a 25% discount Acustomer will be charged a fee if they

on the transaction fee. perform any of the following tasks:
. . Buy a crypto asset with fiat from

A fee of 0.5% is generated when converting their account

fiat to fiat, if the customer exceeds

normal monthly use (see TAP card section Buy a crypto asset with another

for normal monthly use). This remains crypto asset

significantly below standard banking
charges, and lower still if this

fee is paid with the Tap token (as users
gain a 25% discount on fees if they pay
with the Tap token). Additionally, Tap
also earns interchange fee on all card
transactions.

Make a purchase on their card
where a crypto asset is used to fund
the purchase.

The interchange fee is the fee charged
to the vendor and is shared between the
vendors bank, the card provider and Tap.
Tap will realistically expect an average of
0.2% of the total transaction amount.

The tap
token

At Tap, we feel it is important that the value
of the token is securely anchored to the

success of the project. We believe investors
can take confidence from these 4 features:

1.

Tap token can be used to pay transaction/exchange fees
and receive a 25% discount. This will encourage users to
hold Tap tokens in their wallet, thereby benefiting from the
reduced fees. When the value of the Tap token increases,
in line with wider adoption and increased usage, the user
will see the fiat value of their Tap token holding increase.
This may encourage them to increase their holding of
Tap tokens. Customers buying, holding and using Tap will
bolster the value of the Tap token. As the project expands
and gains more customers, it is expected that Tap holdings
will increase.

Stake Tap tokens for higher card level and better user
terms. Staking is when you freeze tokens for a set amount
of time. During this time, those tokens can't be used or
withdrawn until the staking period is complete. A user can
stake certain amounts of Tap tokens to receive a higher
card level and enjoy better user terms. The amount staked
for each card can be seen in the following section. Staked
tokens encourages upward pressure on the token value.

Monthly Tap token burning. Each month, 10% of the profits

method has been employed by Binance, and their coin (BNB)

Supported
currencies

On launch, Tap will support three
cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, LTC)
and three fiat currencies (USD,
EUR, GBP).

Shortly after launch, TAP will expand

these supported currencies to any
cryptocurrency with a daily traded
volume of $lm+ and the top 14 fiat
currencies supported by the card scheme.

If an external project has a token that they
would like Tap to support, they can do so
by supplying Tap the liquidity to support
the currency (an amount in fiat and their
own tokens) and commit to sending Tap
a number of users. As Tap will support
the currency before the users are sent,

a deposit will need to be paid by the
external project which will be refunded
once the registered user agreement has
been reached.

This will benefit both the external projects
(as new buyers can easily buy their
tokens) and Tap (as it will have increased
the number of supported tokens and gain
more members by doing so).

Competitive
landscape

The market has proven that it also
recognizes the value of such projects
with two competitors reaching peak
token market caps of $550m and $250m,
and one business valuation of $1.4bn.
We consider these projects to be either
incomplete or inferior to Tap.

After analyzing all competitors in the
market (including Monaco, Metalpay, Tenx,
STK token, Revolut, Tokencard and WireX),
we believe that a genuine competitor to
Tap must have the following features to
achieve mass market adoption:

White paper v2.5.1 | © 2019 Tap N Go limited | All rights reserved

This leaves just Monaco and Revolut

as real competitors to Tap. As only one
project is functional right now, we have
gathered information about them
through their website and whitepapers
(information gathered to the best of our
knowledge at the time of going to press,
their terms may have changed).

One project worth mentioning here is
Tenx. At their peak, their token market

the competitive table as there is no easy
onboarding with fiat for the purchase of
cryptocurrencies.

However, investors can take
encouragement from their peak market
cap (which has dropped considerably
since their Visa cards were revoked).

Analysis of key
competitors

Revolut is probably the most well-known
competitor to Tap (certainly in Europe) and
has recently seen their value go up five
fold in one year, to a company valuation
of $1.4fon1. Whilst Revolut made its name
as a travel app, they now offer the option
of buying and exchanging crypto assets.
However, there are limitations as Revolut
does not support external transfers of
crypto. This means that you are unable to
onboard with crypto or send your crypto
outside the Revolut ecosystem.

This essentially means that if you already
have crypto, Revolut is not your solution.
We believe these limitations will lessen
Revolut’s appeal to the 24 million people
who currently use cryptol2. TAP’s other
main advantage over Revolut is the lack
of subscription costs (Revolut charges
£6.99 to unlock crypto utility). Tap offers all
the services Revolut offers but with higher
utility, more features and less cost to the
end user.

Monaco provides more features to the
crypto user than Revolut and offers many
of the same features as Tap. However, we
are yet to see evidence that Monaco will
be able to provide instant exchange at
point of sale with the card. Perhaps the
main advantage of Tap against Monaco
is the fiat-to-crypto fee charged. At the
time of publication, Monaco charge 4.5%
commission for fiat-to-crypto exchange
which in our opinion would make them
uncompetitive when trying to capture
the 815,000 new crypto adopters each
month’.

White paper v2.5.1 | © 2019 Tap N Go limited | All rights reserved

Investors should seek a strong direct link
between the project success and the
token value, meaning project owners only
benefit at the same time as investors

and proportionately. Investors who stake
a minimum amount of Monaco receive
additional benefits, however we believe
that there is a weak correlation between
project success and token value.

There is currently no investment
onboarding for Revolut as there is no
token attached. We believe that much
of the increase in market cap of tokens
attached to similar projects to Tap has
been speculative and exposes investors
to greater levels of risk than Tap. What
makes Tap so exciting to an investor is
the stronger direct link between project
success and token value (as seen in Tap
Token section on page xx).

Risks t
the investor
& mitigations

White paper v2.5.1 | © 2019 Tap N Go limited | All rights reserved
10.1
Competition

We have addressed Taps current competitors, but we
acknowledge the potential for future market entrants.

Taps proprietary middleware, market-leading customer
offer and ability to seamlessly move between alternative
and fiat currencies provides a service that crypto users
and frequent travelers alike are demanding. This will drive
adoption from both groups and gives Tap a key “first-
mover’ advantage over future competitors.

The systems to provide these services are difficult to
replicate, yet Tap will continue innovating. Along with
additional features and user benefits as Tap scales,

the resultant cost efficiencies will be shared with

users. When you combine this with stringent ongoing
quality assurance procedures, we believe any serious
competitor would find it more favorable to purchase the
Tap project rather than to build a competing product.

10.2

Project owners rest on their
laurels following initial raise

There are numerous examples of projects generating significant interest at launch
and failing to build on their foundations, or certainly at a reasonable rate. This raises
concerns about the motivation of a project once they have their raised money.

The Tap project is different. The public raise will only happen once we have a
minimum viable product ready. Therefore, the team and owners of Tap can only be
compensated for their efforts when the service is ready. For more information about
the raise, please see token generation event on page xx.

White paper v2.5.1 | © 2019 Tap N Go limited | All rights reserved www.tap.global
10.3

Payment card
services being
revoked

Followers of projects like TenX and Wirex have seen
card services revoked, even after issue. This is because
Wavecrest, their card issuer, issued cards outside of their
jurisdiction in the convention of guidelines specified

by Visa. For Wirex, who had already performed $1.5b6n

in transaction volume, this proved disastrous for their

1.5 million users (N.B. WireX was not featured in our
competitive analysis as their customers can only hold
BTC and would need to convert into fiat manually to
make a payment. We do however take encouragement
from their user numbers and transaction volumes).

Visa and Mastercard have subsequently issued strict
guidelines for crypto projects to follow, whereas
previously there werent any, which led to confusion in
the market. Better guidelines from Visa & Mastercard and
our choice of card issuer Transact Payments (with an
excellent record of guideline compliance) mean that we
believe we have mitigated this key risk.

10.4
Fraud and data theft

Any company offering money services and accepting debit card deposits may find
itself targeted for fraud or data theft.

Tap has taken every measure possible to protect against this risk. These measures
include the highest-level KYC registration (provided by industry leader W2 Global Data),
the highest level of PCI DSS compliance from all Tap’s partners and making sure no
sensitive customer data is stored by Tap. On top of this, Tap will only accept debit card
deposits from 3D secure cards meaning that if the transaction is fraudulent, Tap is not
responsible for reimbursement.

State of the

crypto market

The crypto market suffered a
large correction in early 2018
which raised questions about the
long-term health of the market
and whether this will affect Tap.

Our team believes the correction was a
necessary (and temporary) response to
an over-paced expansion in the second
half of 2017. It is, however, important

to see how Tap would benefit during
any market cycle. User trends point to
increases in new crypto investors during
rising markets. Therefore, our marketing
will focus on new investors and existing
investors keen to increase their holdings
during bull runs. Tap is especially well
placed to service these users.

Tap offers by far the easiest and most
transparent onboarding process, together
with the lowest fiat-to-crypto transaction
fees. More experienced investors will look
for a place where they can seamlessly
navigate between multiple currencies

to benefit from more dynamic market
conditions. Taps unique one touch Alt to
Alt exchange is the obvious choice for
more seasoned and sophisticated crypto
investors.

White paper v2.5.1 | © 2019 Tap N Go limited | All rights reserved

During periods of prolonged market
stagnation, spending of crypto assets

has lower opportunity cost which will
encourage d rise in crypto-to-fiat card
transactions. In falling markets, Tap allows
customers to move straight from crypto-
to-fiat at the touch of a button with instant
fulfilment and the lowest transaction costs.

Investors can then choose to invest fiat

in other assets or maintain liquidity in
anticipation of buying opportunities that
present themselves. Therefore, no matter
the market conditions, Tap provides the
easiest, most cost efficient and seamless
service to the market. Tap generates
exchange fees in all market conditions.
With a dynamic and adaptive marketing
strategy for every market condition we can
gain market share and boost usage which
will help bolster the price of Tap token.

Taps Regulatory Licenses

Tap chose Gibraltar as a domicile because
it offers what we believe to be the best
developed regulatory framework for
businesses providing services in the
sectors Tap wishes to operate in.

Gibraltar is a British Overseas Territory
and a member of the EU by virtue of its
association with the United Kingdom. The
DLT regulatory framework in Gibraltar
provides Tap the opportunity to apply for
a DLT Provider licence which would enable
Tap to operate its DLT business within a
regulated environment. Such a regulatory
framework, designed specifically for DLT
business, is currently not available in most
jurisdictions.

To the extent possible, Tap endeavours

to obtain authorisation from the relevant
regulatory body for every aspect of its
services. Tap has chosen partners that
already have a long standing record of
regulatory compliance in their respective
business areas. Tap has instructed
Hassans International Law Firm to advise
and assist with the DLT licence application
process with the Gibraltar Financial Service
Commission.

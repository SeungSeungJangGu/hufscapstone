<1 JOINTER

Background

Jointer is a decentralized financial (DeFi) and property technology (PropTech)
company established in 2017 in Silicon Valley,CA and expanded to include Tel Aviv,
Israel. The company is funded by-its founders and private investors. Jointer has
invested talent, resources, and funds to build-an alternative to Commercial Real Estate
syndication, scaling the:connection between investors and owners in a complete

end-to-end blockchain-syndication and investment-solution,

Where most solutions cfowdfund<or tokenize individual assets. which presents
scalability issués, limited liquidity, and unnecessary, risks for investors, Jointer
democratizes Commercial Real Estate investments by making thesprocess safe and
simple for all. With a single check, Jointer creates a Joint Venture partnership with
property owners as the Master LP-investor, which\removes the-need for syndication.
On the other side, Jointer allows the general public to become sub LP investors by

buying Jointer assets that are pegged with leverage to. the Global All REIT Index.

Commercial Real Estate syndication’ is limited/to~accredited and sophisticated
investors with a lot of barriers and a lack of liquidity. Public syndication such REITs, do
not solve these problems because they provide low returns due to leverage regulation
limitations. Jointer ventures and crowdfunding do not solve the liquidity issue and

require a high level of knowledge and underwriting for investors.

Jointer is a new blockchain based syndication model that provides solutions to these

issues, giving investors a high return with the low risks of a REIT.
Vision — A Safe and Profitable Alternative
for All

Jointer strives to digitize and simplify the Commercial Real Estate industry so that every investor,
even one with zero knowledge or experience, will have the opportunity to enjoy lucrative asset
returns along with low risk investing and high liquidity. Jointer is an alternative to REITs that pays

double the returns of a REIT.

“Jointer’s new tokenization approach presents
a better solution that has the potential to
disrupt the real estate industry.”

@) _ David weild Iv
Py The former Vice Chairman of the NASDAQ and Father of the US JOBS Act

In building the Jointer syndication model, the team engaged over 500 Commercial Real Estate
industry experts both from an ownership and investment perspective. The insight the experts

provided lends itself to a Jointer solution that fulfills a major need in a revolutionary way.

Historic Commercial Real Estate
Investment Vehicles

Most Commercial Real Estate investment takes place by formation of private funds! through a
Joint Venture partnership (JV) or through public funds like a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT).
The differences between these two strategies highlights investors needs and where Jointer adds

value.

REITs are diversified with many assets and provide liquidity on exchanges such as the NASDAQ
or NYSE, while Joint Ventures are designed for property owners that take a loan from lenders and
need capital for a down payment. Usually, owners syndicate the funds from multiple individual
accredited investors, taking time, resources, and providing limited liquidity, since the principal is

tied up in the property for a few years? creating exposure based on a single property.

1 Joint Ventures can also include public syndication crowdfunding and more recently, tokenization.
2 In theory, security token exchanges were created to increase this liquidity. Although in practice, the market has shown these exchanges
do not provide liquidity or increased consumer options.
Moreover, Joint Ventures are able to outperform REITs because they leverage properties with
debt loans while REITs tend to avoid debt? to focus on increasing cash flow which determines

their valuation.

Although JVs can provide higher returns, retail investors will continue to invest in REITs over JVs
because JVs are unable to welcome non-accredited* investors. Further, institutional investors
which qualify for JV investments will continue to choose REITs as well because they need to
diversify their investments. Moreover, it is impractical for institutional investors to analyze and
oversee the many properties necessary to outperform an index. Further, the same barriers for
institutions lead to excluding the general public as high amounts of knowledge and due

diligence become necessary to ensure a profitable exit.

Solving the CRE Syndication Problem with a New Approach

For acentury, regulation limited retail investors from investing directly with private funds such as
joint ventures, and institutional investors have not found a solution for partnering with property
owners directly without increasing the risk they have with REITs. Therefore, both parties struggle
to invest in the lucrative Commercial Real Estate asset class via a JV partnership. On the other
hand, when property owners need to raise the down payment to purchase new properties or to
re-cap exciting properties, they currently rely on a time-consuming syndication process

requiring them to source checks from many individual accredited investors.®

Jointer acts as Master LP on one side, solving the liquidity issue and more, by providing property
owners one check to buy the available equity or to cover the needed down payment for a new
property. On the other side, Jointer allows retail and institutional investors diversification
through the purchase of JNTR/ETN assets which are backed by cross-collateral and pegged to 2X

leverage on the Dow Jones Select Global REIT Index.

Current JV and Crowdfunding Solutions

When developing Jointer, current tokenization solutions were investigated to determine their
viability and benefits, yet highlight where they fall short and how Jointer brings true solutions to

very old and painful problems.

There is a public misconception that tokenization as a concept can help syndicate funds to
purchase new assets or unlock equity by selling a fraction of ownership or an income stream to
the crowd. Even though many tokenization companies have raised tens of millions of dollars,
none are feasible syndication solutions for properties not currently owned by the issuer.
Regulation restricts future owners from offering equity in an asset they do not yet own’? (unless
the future owner is also acting as a licensed Broker-Dealer offering other people's security). This
means current tokenization solutions cannot solve syndication problem like Jointer does and

therefore, do not constitute direct competition to Jointer.

Jointer could end up partnering with JV's down the road, offering its solution to a broader range

of investment opportunities.

In spite of all these shortcomings, JV solutions can allow existing owners to tokenize existing
equity or income streams, yet sourcing investment through syndication still falls solely on the
owner. To syndicate a property using current JV models, the same costly practice of marketing
and soliciting to many investors must occur in addition to any fees due to the tokenization

company.®

The Jointer model offers existing owners a true solution, providing an end-to-end service for free,

with one check and minimal effort.

Commercial Real Estate
Investors

Overview

While Commercial Real Estate investing is proven to be a lucrative
method of creating wealth?, the opportunity for investors to become

successful in this industry presents three challenges.

The first challenge is to minimize risk? which typically requires
investors to be sophisticated and experienced or alternatively, investors

can hedge their risk through diversifying their portfolio.

Second, to ensure there is an exit strategy for investment liquidity.
Without liquidity, investors are left vulnerable to high capital costs and

low secondary market prices due to the high costs of due diligence??.

And third, investors need to weigh returns against their principal

capital investment to see if they can produce a high ROI?2.

Traditional Solutions: Joint Venture
vs REITS

Joint Venture - Private fund

Diversification

Joint Venture investments are a private fund created through O O

a partnership with a specific property owner (also referred to

as sponsors or principles). To obtain a diversified portfolio, Oo
investors have to perform due diligence on each property and O O

source multiple opportunities just to find a few to invest in.

Liquidity

A liquidity event takes place on average 3-7 years after

purchase.

Returns

JV returns can be high and average ~20% a year over a 5 year ~20%

holding period.

REIT - Public Fund

Diversification O
REITs source multiple properties to hedge risk. An investment { \
in a REIT is investing in the asset portfolio of the issuer so the [] /\
diversification is usually considered stronger than a private

fund.

13
Liquidity

REITs improve upon the limited or non-existent liquidity that

direct investors receive by trading on exchanges such as the
NASDAQ and NYSE, so their liquidity is considered high.

Returns

REITs have unused debt leverage?? so the average returns are

usually in the range of 8%-12% a year which is 50% lower than

average JV fund investment returns. Evenso, institutional

investors cannot invest through JV partnerships!* thus

preferring REITs, with a goal to outperform the S&P 500, not JV

returns.

Modern Solutions: Crowdfunding and
Tokenization

As mentioned above, regulation restricts future owners from offering equity in an asset they do
not yet own. The only way the future owner can do this is by also acting as a Broker-Dealer

offering other people security tokens.

In spite of all these shortcomings, tokenization solutions can allow existing owners to tokenize
existing equity or income streams, while sourcing investment through syndication still falls solely

on the owner. This means to syndicate a property using current tokenization models, the same

costly practice of marketing and soliciting to many investors must occur in addition to any fees

due to the tokenization company.

Furthermore, Jointer believes there is no logic for existing property owners to use tokenization as
a syndication solution for re-cap investment because when owners see the risks and costs

associated with tokenization they may lose incentive to participate.

Also Jointer believes that current tokenization solutions expose investors to risk of fraud and loss

of funds. Here are examples of weak spots that current tokenization models cannot overcome:

Vulnerable to scams

Owners may scam investors by offering equity for properties they do not own.
= False claims

Owners of properties may make false claims about property's financial status

and/or value.

Over-leveraged

GS

Owners may scam investors by selling them tokens for properties with no equity

available.

2 Limited transparency
Owners could take advantage of unsophisticated investors!S who are unaware of

how to properly underwrite a property. An example of this would be if an owner
misrepresented a property by selling tokens representing a $1OMM value when the

property is only worth $5MM.

15 Cohen, J. (2016). A study on the history and functionality of real estate crowdfunding.

15
»p 6 @ &

Must trust dividend distribution
Owners may not honor dividend distributions, a situation which leaves investors

with no recourse.

No Principal
Owners may sell 100% of their equity in the property and leave it without any

principal in place.

Risk disclosure
Investors could be misled through non-disclosure of the risks of a distressed or

completely vacant property, which is also a property not generating income.

Conflict of interest
Owners naturally have a conflict of interest with investors and may benefit from

misleading them.

Limited liquidity
Investors may have an issue with liquidity because there is no guarantee that
secondary marketplace exchanges will welcome every token. For example, they

may only support tokens with high daily trading volumes.

Restrictive selling

One of the biggest hindrances for owners who wish to tokenize their properties is
the inability to sell a percentage to more than 100 investors (or shareholders)
unless: 1) they are qualified purchasers; or, 2) the owners turn their property into a
public company; or 3) the company is registered with the SEC under a Reg At+

exemption. All these factors are necessary to address, as well as costly and

time-intensive.

Until these issues are addressed, the Commercial Real Estate industry cannot scale using

tokenization solutions and investors risk exposure to fraud and scams.

After taking into account all of the serious issues associated with current tokenization solutions,

Jointer's approach provides a true alternative to Commercial Real Estate syndication, even for

re-cap investment?®. Jointer provides property owners one check to buy available equity or to

cover the needed down payment. On the other side, Jointer allows investors to minimize their

risk by receiving cross-collateral and returns based on 2X leverage pegged to the proven Dow
Jones Select All REIT Index.

Jointer’s Approach for Investors

The Jointer Tokenization approach levels the playing field in the Commercial Real Estate
industry by offering investors from all walks of life the opportunity to participate in the
commercial market without the barriers or risks associated with the current tokenization models

and traditional solutions, mentioned above.

Jointer presents investors instant diversification while improving their returns and minimizing
risk. Investors who invest through JNTR/ETN assets benefit from an investment vehicle that is
pegged to the diversified Global Select REIT Index with 2X the leverage and are backed by

cross-collateral.

Jointer's diversification means zero exposure to any one specific property risk. Investment
distributions and returns are managed by a smart contract, which ensures full transparency and
trustless process. Income and investment streams serve as cross collateral and the index

performance is based on fully-disclosed public information.

Furthermore, JNTR/ETN is an intangible asset, carrying capital gains tax benefits. This means
unlike with REITs, INTR/ETN investors do no need to pay income tax on their profits. Investors will
only pay capital gains taxes based on the country they associate with. In some countries,

investor's JNTR/ETN underlying profits may end up with zero taxes.

17
In addition, Jointer acts as a market maker with a buyback program as JNTR/ETN assets are
redeemable to Jointer for a fixed value of $1 per asset plus the percentage increase of 2X leverage
on the Dow Jones Clobal Select All REIT Index. The Jointer solution offers investors the liquidity,
security, and transparency that Jointer believes no other model can offer in the Commercial Real

Estate marketplace.

Historical Data

The Dow Jones Global Select REIT Index is designed to measure the performance of publicly
traded REITs and REIT-like securities and is a subindex of the Dow Jones Global Select Real
Estate Securities Index (RESI), which seeks to measure equity real estate investment trusts
(REITs) traded globally. The index is designed to serve as a proxy for direct real estate investment
in part by excluding companies whose performance may be driven by factors other than the

value of real estate.

Current Issues

f Syndication Barrier
Commercial Real Estate sponsors need funds for down payments to purchase new

properties or to re-cap their existing properties.

(2) Lucrative Deals Lost
Commercial Real Estate deals move quickly and most are closed off market, so

when buyers have to spend extra time to syndicate funds, deals can be lost.

‘ Investor Limits
Assuming that the property title will be held by an LLC, the number of
shareholders will be limited to no more than 100, per Reg D, making the

out-of-pocket per investor significant, limiting the pool of potential investors.

= Compliance

Maintaining compliance requires legal preparations such as preparing a PPM
(Private Placement Memorandum), risk disclosure, and SEC _ registration.
Furthermore, solicitation is limited to investors who have a_ pre-existing

relationships with the issuer.

Jointer’s Solution for Owners

With the Jointer tokenization model, owners fundraise from just one source - Jointer - and
receive one check, entirely eliminating the traditional method of syndication or the need for
current tokenization market solutions. In addition to the instant fundraising via one check to
purchase a new property and unlock existing equity for free with zero regulatory exposure,

Jointer offers owners 50% promote/carry, double the industry standard of 20%.

21
Why Owners will Prefer Jointer

Free Fundraising

By removing the need for syndication, Jointer is able to offer
no-cost funding to experienced owners with qualifying

properties.

Instant Funding

Once Jointer's due diligence is complete and the property is
cleared for investment, Jointer can perform within 24 hours.

Performance means providing the owner a check for their

equity.

End-to-End Solution
First, by removing the need for syndication, all other complex
issues and high costs associated with the process are removed.

Further, Jointer’s funding process does not change owner's
closing habits and will take place using regular title companies
and fiat currency such as the US Dollar.

Skin in the Game

The industry standard for sponsor contribution is 10% of the
down payment (considered “the skin in the game’”.) Jointer is
not changing the industry standard so in cases of purchasing a
new property or re-cap an existing property, Jointer will

purchase 50% - 90% of the equity available.

Sponsors’ Promote (also know as a carry)

The industry standard for a sponsor's carry is to receive on

average, a 20% carry from the properties profits, usually after

investors (LP) receive preferred returns (5%-12%). Jointer offers

sponsors better terms with a 50% carry after the preferred

returns. On average, using Jointer over traditional syndication

will net sponsors 175%.increased ROI. 22

Identifying and Sourcing Opportunities

Jointer has passive and active sourcing development methods to
identify properties. The passive method is to let new buyers and
existing owners that want to benefit from Jointer'’s instant
funding to apply. The active method includes partnering with
loan brokers and real estate agents that can refer Jointer to new

buyers and existing owners.

Deep Underwriting

Jointer underwrites opportunities by checking the owner's track
record as well as the property and the market. Every property
goes through six levels of underwriting, including the sharing
economy model with analysts, Al analysis, and obtaining an

independent appraisal report.

REPORTS

Jointer's goal is to identify the best real estate opportunities with both low risk and high ROI. To
do this, Jointer will analyze an enormous number of properties, something individual investors

would do on every property they invest in.

This technology allows Jointer to select and quickly analyze the best opportunities and
investments just like professional real estate investors do manually. Jointer has spent the last
three years developing a highly effective advanced machine learning system. This system can

complete a comprehensive analysis of properties in less than five seconds.

Quick initial analysis allows Jointer to quickly and cost effectively qualify properties for further
due diligence. In order to analyze and predict a property's future valuation that includes risk and
potential ROI! performance, the algorithm requires NOTHING more than the property's street

address.

Jointer Syndication
Economy

Overview

The Jointer Syndication economy is powered by 3 different and unique

asset classes, JNTR/NOTE, JNTR/ETN, and JNTR/STOCK. The goal of the

three asset classes is to meet all investor needs for continuous liquidity,

improved risk distribution, and high returns.

JNTR/NOTE
DIGITAL LIQUIDITY NOTE

JNTR/ETN a JNTR/STOCK
DIGITAL EXCHAN' a DIG! ERRED STOCK

The secured assets are managed on a distributed ledger, such as the Ethereum blockchain,

which allows for instant distribution and 24/7 liquidity.

Jointer's Syndication economy focuses on short term and long term value for investors. The
decision to create a Syndication economy that is attractive to all fits within Jointer’s mission to
make Commercial Real Estate available to everyone. To accomplish this, Jointer issues three

assets to fit the needs of every investor:

INTR/NOTE
Is a liquidity asset that serves as a bridge to transfer
of value between JINTR/ETN, JNTR/STOCK, and

currency markets.

INTR/ETN
Is akin to an Exchange-traded Note (ETN) that is
pegged with 2X leverage on the Global Select REIT

Index aiming to provide ~20% returns a year.

IJNTR/STOCK

Is preferred shares in Jointer, gaining value as the

JNTR/STOCK
Ines : . company grows and the number of properties

i Ncreases.grows.

27
JNTR NOTE

INTR/NOTE isa liquidity asset designed as a bridge
to transfer value between JNTR/ETN, JNTR/STOCK,
and currency markets, similar to Ox protocol which i JNTR/NOTE
transfers value between assets on the Ethereum te PS TTALL QUID NOTE
blockchain. JNTR/NOTE will first act as a bridge for

the Ethereum blockchain network and then

potentially explore more blockchain networks.

INTR/NOTE's value is based on the liquidity reserve reducing fluctuations that plague
Ethereum or Bitcoin. In addition to the liquidity reserve driving the value, the difference
between JNTR/NOTE and cryptocurrency is that the utility of INTR/NOTE is fueled by ongoing
demand to access JNTR/ETN or JNTR/STOCK. JNTR/NOTE is the only way of payment to buy
and sell JNTR/ETN or for INTR/STOCK redemption, placing JNTR/NOTE at the center of the

Jointer Syndication economy.

Types of JNTR/NOTE Bridges

The first JNTR/NOTE bridge is with Ethereum. The JNTR/NOTE-ETH bridge allows investors to
convert ETH to JNTR/NOTE and from there convert it to JNTR/ETN or JNTR/STOCK. Future
developments will include support for other blockchains such as JNTR/NOTE-BTC,
JNTR/NOTE-BNB, JNTR/NOTE-EOS, and JNTR/NOTE-TRON.

INTR/NOTE’s Utility Functionality rather than ETH or BTC

REITs own approximately $3 trillion in gross real estate assets, with more than $2 trillion of that
total from publically listed and non-listed REITs and the remainder from privately held REITs.27
By offering traditional REIT investors 2X leverage on the proven Global Select All REITs Index,

the JNTR/ETN asset possess intrinsic demand amongst these investors.

Now, if Jointer allowed trading for JNTR/ETN DIRECTLY against ETH or BTC, the entire
ecosystem would not have the ability to provide continuous liquidity for investors or would

reduce the amount of funds Jointer could invest in commercial real estate.

Furthermore, JNTR/ETN is built on the Ethereum blockchain, therefore it needs cross-chain
(two or more blockchain) capabilities to allow investors to contribute using Bitcoin, Tron, or
Binance directly. JNTR/NOTE provides the cross-chain capabilities for investors. In the future, if
a better blockchain than Ethereum arises, JNTR/NOTE and JNTR/ETN will switch as needed.

28
Buyback for JNTR/ETN and JNTR/STOCK

The JNTR/NOTE asset creates better liquidity for JNTR/ETN and JNTR/STOCK because a
buyback program is not possible without it. Using ETH or BTC instead of the JNTR/NOTE,
Jointer would have to restrict the flow of funds invested in commercial real estate. If Jointer
had to liquidate funds by selling properties everytime people redeem, the company would
not have the freedom to execute lucrative commercial real estate deals. INTR/NOTE presents
the liquid bridge between Jointer’s real estate holdings, investor's index returns, and

cryptocurrency.

Overall Ecosystem Support

Using JNTR/NOTE as a bridge increases the interoperability of the Jointer token ecosystem.
With the ongoing Jointer Auction bringing in funds for a reserve, INTR/NOTE can support
liquidity to Ethereum or Ethereum based stablecoins for all JNTR/ETN and JNTR/STOCK

holders.

Demand for JNTR/NOTE

Even though JNTR/NOTE does not have exposure to commercial real estate, equity or any kind
of returns, it still benefits from the strength of the CRE industry. JNTR/NOTE, similar to OX
protocol, acts as a bridge between assets, in JNTR/NOTE's case this is a $14 trillion addressable

market.18 These investments are far greater than cryptocurrency asset values.

Use of Funds

The use of funds received during the Auction are setup to power a robust and thriving ecosystem
to benefit Jointer investors. Jointer invests 100% of the fundraising amount in commercial real

estate and through liquidity reserve.

The following is a breakdown of the use of funds:

90% Commercial Real Estate

standard.

JINTR/NOTE Value

IJNTR/NOTE will start with price of $0.01 USD. Once the Auction begins, the price of INTR/NOTE

is dynamic based on the market.

During the ongoing daily Auction, INTR/NOTE's smart contract contributes 10% of all funds
raised to buyback from the reserve JNTR/NOTE assets that have been redeemed by the public.
This act will increase the liquidity reserve and will also keep the JNTR/NOTE value strong

against redemption.
To avoid high slippage rates, INTR/NOTE will split the 10% contributions over 24 hours

IJNTR/NOTE Minting

Jointer will pre mint $15M worth of INTR/NOTE assets that will be distributed between Jointer's
early investors, Jointer’s providers, Advisors, and Jointer's team. Ongoing minting is based on

daily Auction supply.

Mint based on Auction supply

The Auction minting is based the ongoing daily auction results. For Day 1 of the Auction,

Jointer's mint of INTR/NOTE is determined by the success of the previous day.

If the previous day's fundraising amount is equal to or higher than the day before, Jointer will
mint 1% more the following day. If the previous day’s fundraising amount is less than the day
before, Jointer will reduce the amount of tokens offered on the following day with the ratio

between the fundraising amounts.

Further, JNTR/NOTE is minted in accordance with the group and individual bonuses

mentioned in the Auction section of this document.

Mint based on JNTR/STOCK distribution

Every time the smart contract generates a new JNTR/STOCK, the smart contract will also
generate JNTR/NOTE assets at the same face value of the JNTR/STOCK. The JNTR/NOTE assets
are locked on the smart contract and used to buyback JNTR/STOCK when redemption takes

place.

Purchasing JNTR/NOTE

Investors have the ability to purchase JNTR/NOTE assets in four ways:

ta) Auction

Secondary Market Exchange

SmartSwap

Jointer Reserve liquidity program on Bancor Network

32
Auction

Jointer’s auction allows participants to purchase JNTR/NOTE assets on a daily basis based on a
set supply which is determined by the previous days fundraising. Participants are able to
contribute any amount they desire and the daily asset allocation (supply) will be split pro rata
amongst participants. (See the Jointer Auction Section for more information on participating in

the Jointer auction).

Example Distribution
Starting point: 100,000 Daily Supply

Investor Investment Value INTR/NOTE Distributed

c $250 13,157.8947368
D $100 5,263.1578947
E $50 2,631.5789474

Secondary Market Exchange

Investors can purchase JNTR/NOTE assets via secondary market exchanges licensed as
Alternative Trading Systems (ATS) such as tZERO or Open Finance, Over-the-Counter (OTC) or

regular cryptocurrency exchanges (LIMITED to non-US investors).

Investors that buy JNTR/NOTE assets are required to go through KYC and AML based on Reg S
while investors from US and regulated countries investors will need to also conduct full

accreditation checks based on Reg D 506 (c).

Secondary market exchanges will be able to offer to investors trading within 90 days after the
first JNTR/NOTE is sold.

33
Bancor Network - The Jointer Reserve

Jointer will establish the reserve on Day 1 with Bancor. The initial setup is a 1:1 value ratio of INTR
and BNT. As apart of the buyback program, Jointer will take 10% of the daily contributions to
increase liquidity by purchasing JNTR from the reserve. The contributions will be distributed in

increments within 24 hours automatically.

To understand how the Bancor reserve works visit:

https://blog.bancor.network/how-bancor-relays-work-c712a374374f

Authorized Bancor Interaction

While implementing the Jointer reserve, it became clear that redemptions would be based on a
first in, first out basis. To encourage fair redemption amongst all token holders, Jointer created a
mechanism that provides redemption on a pro-rata basis, ensuring everyone is able to enjoy for

the reserve's liquidity.

To achieve pro-rata distribution, Jointer will issue a smart contract to hold the orders and then
limit which smart contracts can interact with the reserve. By implementing a smart contract that

receives redemption requests, we are able to distribute reserve funds fairly and evenly.

Jointer Reserve Circuit Breakers

Circuit breakers are useful tools employed by stock markets, banks, and other investment
entities to protect against a run on the bank scenario and protect the asset's value. Jointer

utilizes a circuit breaker on reserve redemptions.

Jointer's circuit breaker has an automatic trigger built into the same smart contract that Jointer
uses to provide pro-rata reserve distribution. This trigger, allows 90% of the previous days reserve

contributions to be distributed.

Example:
Jointer’s Auction raises $10,000 for the reserve

The next day, up to $9,000 will be allocated for pro-rata redemption distribution

34
No Reserve Contribution Trigger

Jointer tested thousands of outcomes through game-theory action simulations in order to
prepare for as much as possible. In order to maintain liquidity during a bear market, Jointer set
up ano reserve contribution liquidity trigger. This trigger provides reserve liquidity even with

zero contributions going to the reserve from the daily auction.

Through an automated process, Jointer will sell 10% of the rally tokens.* Next, Jointer will take the
proceeds and push the capital to the reserve similar to quantitative easing but with increased

redemptions instead of easier lending.

By pushing capital to the reserve, redemptions will remain ongoing even though the reserve did

not receive any funds.

Example:

Jointer has $100,000 worth of relay tokens

Jointer's Auction raises $0 for the reserve

The $0 contributions triggers a sale of 10% of the relay tokens for $10,000
The $10,000 is placed in the reserve

4 Selling relay tokens reduces the numerator and denominator of total tokens equally by 10% without changing the
token value or token ratio. Learn more about Bancor rally tokens:

35
SmartSwap

JNTR/STOCK
DIGITAL PREFERRED STOCK

JNTR/STOCK
DIGITAL PREFERRED STOCK

Jointer will allow users to swap JNTR/NOTE assets through SmartSwap, which is powered by
ElementZero. (Jointer's subsidiary company) Element Zero SmartSwap provides investors a
decentralized trading options providing a Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Community trading
technology built on Ethereum. The trustless SmartSwap provides a way to exchange assets and
currencies without using a hot wallet, without signup, all while guaranteeing an exact face value

match. SmartSwap's asset-to-asset swaps are precise, low risk, and 100% fee-free.

In addition, investors are able to trade JNTR/NOTE assets using other P2P and P2C exchanges,
such as Atomic Swaps. Such trades are limited between whitelisted wallet holders that have
been cleared by Jointer for KYC and AML regulatory requirements and subject to other
regulations on a country-by-country basis. The transaction will fail if the receiving wallet is not on
the whitelist.

SmartSwap P2P

SmartSwap Peer-2-Peer allows users to generate a transaction ID that can be sent directly to a
specific person they want to swap with. Once the transaction ID is created and the users send
their coins to that transaction ID, the swap will be available only to the party that knows about
the transaction ID address. Once the swap takes place, the SmartSwap will swap the same face

value and if there is any delta, it will be returned to whom it belongs

Example:

Bob wants to swap $1,000 JNTR/NOTE with $1,000 ETH.
Bob sends his order to the SmartSwap and generates the transaction ID for the P2P swap.
Bob shares that transaction ID with his friend Lisa.

Since Lisa only sent $500 ETH against Bob's JNTR, the SmartSwap will execute the order of
$500 JNTR/NOTE against $500 ETH.

The $500 JNTR/NOTE delta SmartSwap will return back to Bob's wallet.

36
SmartSwap P2C

SmartSwap Peer-2-Community allows users to swap coins without the need to identify or know
who the other party or parties are. SmartSwap will search one or more other parties to swap with
as one transaction if possible or many if needed. In case one transaction is not enough to cover
the face value of the swap, the SmartSwap will perform a partial swap first and then keep the rest
of the funds pending until more potential swaps are identified. Users with pending funds are
allowed to cancel the outstanding portion of the trade and receive back the funds to the same

wallet it was sent from.

Example:

Bob wants to swap $1,000 JNTR/NOTE with $1,000 ETH.

Bob sends his order to SmartSwap and SmartSwap immediately identifies one person that
wants to swap $500 ETH against JNTR/NOTE.

In this case, Bob will get the first $500 ETH and the rest of the $500 JNTR will stay pending
until the SmartSwap will identify more users that want to swap ETH with JNTR/NOTE.

Selling JNTR/NOTE

Jointer provides investors with multiple options for selling their JNTR/NOTE assets. Although
there is an initial lock-up period of 90 days, that clock starts from when the first JNTR/NOTE is
sold. Within this period, investors can redeem JNTR/NOTE through the Jointer Reserve liquidity

program which is powered by Bancor Network.

Secondary Market Exchange

JINTR/NOTE tokens require 90 day holding periods before investors can trade their tokens on
exchanges. In addition, the ability to sell the tokens after the holding period is over is limited to

other investors that are cleared on the Jointer whitelist.

The 90 days begins after the first JNTR/NOTE asset is sold. Once the 90 day resale exemption
period ends, investors can go through Jointer's exchange partners to purchase JNTR/NOTE

assets from other investors at the market rate.

37
Redemption

JINTR/NOTE assets will be redeemable through Jointer’s Reserve Buyback program which is
powered by Bancor. Users will be able to redeem for all major cryptocurrencies and stablecoins
(dependent upon Bancor supporting the token). The reserve is powered by 10% of the daily

fundraising amount.

Target Investors

INTR/NOTE is attractive to investors due to its utility function within the Jointer syndication
ecosystem as well as the volatility that exists with the assets. These investors focus on a price

driven by strong demand and a strong reserve to ensure liquidity.

Regulation

JINTR/NOTE from a regulatory perspective is a security debt note with 10 years due date.

Investors that buy JNTR/NOTE are required to go through KYC and AML based on Reg S while
investors from US and regulated countries investors will need to also conduct full accreditation
checks based on Reg D 506 (c).

Management Fee

Jointer charges a management fee by minting every day 2% JNTR/NOTE tokens above the daily

supply (read more about management fee below).

Example:
If the daily supply on Day 1 to investors is 100,000, Jointer will mint extra JNTR (102,040.81) The
split is 2,040.81 JNTR to Jointer and 100,000 to investors.

INTR/NOTE Quick Facts

(@) INTR/NOTE serves as a transfer of value between JNTR/ETN, JNTR/STOCK and the
currency market.

(@) INTR/NOTE asset value is determined by the market demand.

(@) IJNTR/NOTE assets can be purchased or redeemed every day using Jointer’s

Auction, exchanges, SmartSwap or through Jointer’s reserve .

(@) INTR/NOTE assets can be converted to JNTR/ETN or JNTR/STOCK at any time.

39
JNTR/ETN

JNTR/ETN assets are pegged with 2X leverage on
he proven Global Select All REIT Index without
exposure to the crypto market volatility. The token Bs JNTR/ETN

has a 10 year maturity date, in which Jointer $ PRGTTAL EXCHANGE/TRADEQNGTE
automatically converts JNTR/ETN tokens with
JNTR/STOCK assets (preferred stock in Jointer) if
he JNTR/ETN has not been redeemed before that
date.

check Global Select All REIT Index performance

here)

JINTR/ETN Value

The JNTR/ETN initial price will be $1 USD and the value will change at a rate of 2X leverage on the
Global Select All REIT Index on a daily basis. Jointer will update the JNTR/ETN face value which is
determined by the daily reporting data provided by the NASDAQ or Dow Jones. The new value
IJNTR/ETN provides investors coincides with the percentage change of the Index multiplied by
the 2X leverage.

Example:

Bob invests $100 on January 1, to purchase 100 JNTR/ETN, each day the token increases or
decreases based on the index performance . After one year of holding the token, the index
generates an average return of 10%. Since JNTR/ETN offers 2X leverage the JNTR/ETN face value
is calculated as follows $100 X 110% X 2 = $120

*N.B. Jointer still needs to deduct 10% a carry from Bob index profits therefore the $120 in the

example above is not net profit for Bob [read more about Jointer's Carry].

40
JNTR/ETN Minting

INTR/ETN will not be pre-mined and is created when investors purchase the token using
INTR/NOTE.

Example:

At the time Bob converts JNTR tokens at market value of $100, Jointer mints JNTR/x tokens at
face value of $100.

JNTR/ETN Burning

Similar to how JNTR/ETN is minted, JNTR/ETN is burned each time an investor redeems the
INTR/ETN for JNTR/NOTE.

Example:

If Bob converts his 100 JNTR/ETN with a face value of $120 to INTR/NOTE assets with $120 face
value, then Jointer burns the 100 JNTR/ETN assets.

Purchasing JNTR/ETN

Investors have the ability to purchase JNTR/ETN assets in two ways:

1) Secondary Market Exchange

[2 ) SmartSwap

Secondary Market Exchange

Investors can purchase JNTR/ETN via secondary market exchanges licensed as Alternative
Trading Systems (ATS) such as tZERO or Open Finance, Over-the-Counter (OTC), or regular

cryptocurrency exchanges (LIMITED to non-US investors).

41
Investors that buy JNTR/ETN are required to go through KYC and AML based on Reg §S while
investors from US and regulated countries investors will need to also conduct full accreditation
checks based on Reg D 506 (c).

Secondary market exchanges will be able to offer to investors trading within 90 days after the
first INTR/ETN sold.

Disclosure: Jointer will respect JNTR/ETN based on fix face value of $1 USD plus the changes due
to the 2X leverage index, which means even if investors sell JNTR/ETN to each other on secondary
market above or below that pace value, Jointer still respects INTR/ETN at $1 USD plus the

changes due to the 2X leverage index.

Arbitration opportunity

Even if investors use a secondary market exchange to purchase their JNTR/ETN above or below
it's respected index calculated price, Jointer still will value the JNTR/ETN equally. Therefore,
investors will have the opportunity for arbitrage buying and selling between exchanges and the
value Jointer redeems the INTR/ETN.

Instant Swap with JNTR/NOTE

IJNTR/ETN assets are easily purchased by converting it with JNTR/NOTE assets (see above for
purchasing JNTR/NOTE assets). JNTR/ETN assets are available for purchase starting on Day 1, so

investors will begin seeing the returns take effect immediately.

Jointer has developed SmartSwap swap tool powered by Element Zero that allows users, at any
time, to convert JNTR/NOTE instantly to JNTR/ETN by keeping the same face value. The
IJNTR/ETN tokens are sent immediately to the investors wallet so they can maintain custody of

their tokens at all times.

42
Swap

Jointer will allow users to swap their JNTR/ETN through SmartSwap which is powered by
ElementZero. (Jointer's subsidiary company) The SmartSwap is a decentralized swap solution
providing Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Community technology built on Ethereum. The trustless
SmartSwap provides a way to swap cryptocurrencies without using a hot wallet while
guaranteeing an exact face value match. SmartSwap's crypto-to-crypto swaps are precise, low
risk, and 100% fee-free.

In addition, investors are able to trade JNTR/ETN assets using other P2P and P2C exchanges,
such as Atomic Swaps. Such trades are limited between JNTR/ETN to INTR/NOTE and limited to
whitelisted wallet holders that have been cleared by Jointer for KYC and AML regulatory
requirements and subject to other regulations on a country-by-country basis. The transaction

will fail if the receiving wallet is not on the whitelist.

P2P and P2C trading also falls under the 90 day resale exemption set out by the SEC. The locked
period will end after 90 days.

SmartSwap P2P

SmartSwap Peer-2-Peer allows users to generate a transaction ID that can be sent directly to a
specific person they want to swap with. Once the transaction ID is created and the users send
their coins to that transaction ID, the swap will be available only to the party that knows about
the transaction ID address. Once the swap takes place, the SmartSwap will swap the same face

value and if there is any delta, it will be returned to whom it belongs.

Example:

Bob wants to swap $1,000 JNTR/ETN with $1,000 JNTR/NOTE
Bob sends his order to the SmartSwap and generates the transaction ID for the P2P swap.
Bob shares that transaction ID with his friend Lisa.

Since Lisa only sent $500 JNTR/NOTE against Bob's JNTR/ETN, the SmartSwap will execute
the order of $500 JNTR/ETN against $500 JNTR/NOTE.

The $500 JNTR/ETN delta SmartSwap will return back to Bob's wallet.

43
SmartSwap P2C

SmartSwap Peer-2-Community allows users to swap tokens without the need to identify or know
who the other party or parties are. SmartSwap will search one or more other parties to swap with
as one transaction if possible or many if needed. In case one transaction is not enough to cover
the face value of the swap, the SmartSwap will perform a partial swap first and then keep the rest
of the funds pending until more potential swaps are identified. Users with pending funds are
allowed to cancel the outstanding portion of the trade and receive back the funds to the same
wallet it was sent from. In the case that Jointer has the JNTR/NOTE assets available, Jointer will

automatically step forward and swap the JNTR/NOTE with the pending JNTR/EIN.

Bob wants to swap $1,000 JNTR/ETN with $1,000 JNTR/NOTE.

Bob sends his order to SmartSwap and SmartSwap immediately identifies one person that
wants to swap $500 JNTR against JNTR/ETN.

In this case, Bob will get the first $500 ETH and the rest of the $500 JNTR/ETN will stay
pending until the SmartSwap will identify more users that want to swap JNTR/NOTE with
INTR/ETN.

If Jointer has enough JNTR/NOTE tokens available, the SmartSwap will automatically swap
the rest of the $500 JNTR/ETN assets with Jointer’s JNTR/NOTE assets.

Selling JNTR/ETN

Ensuring investors have liquidity is at the forefront of Jointer’s focus. Keeping with that focus,
Jointer will allow investors to redeem their JNTR/ETN via SmartSwap or through secondary

exchange market partners.

SmartSwap

Investors are able to redeem their JNTR/ETN at anytime for INTR/NOTE. The redemption price is
calculated based on the current JNTR/ETN face value. The value starts at $1 and is multiplied by

the percentage change of the Global Select All REITs Index with 2X leverage.

44
Example:

Bob invests $100 on January 1 to purchase 100 JNTR/ETN, each day the JNTR/NOTE token

increases or decreases based on the index performance.
After one year of holding the token, the index generates an average return of 10%.

Since JNTR/ETN offers 2X leverage, the JNTR/ETN face value is calculated as follows: $100 X
110% X 2 = $120.

Bob pays Jointer’s Carry on those returns, [read more about Jointer’s Carry] and is able to

redeem the rest through Jointer’s platform.

Secondary Market Exchange

Investors can sell JNTR/ETN via Alternative Trading Systems (ATS) such as tZERO or Open
Finance, Over-the-Counter (OTC), or regular cryptocurrency exchanges (LIMITED to non-US

investors).

Investors that buy JNTR/ETN are required to go through KYC and AML based on Reg §S while
investors from US and regulated countries will need to also conduct full accreditation checks
based on Reg D 506 (c).

Secondary market exchanges will be able to offer to investors trading within 90 days after the
first INTR/ETN sold.

Security tokens such as JNTR/ETN require certain holding periods per SEC regulation which
locks the liquidity investors prefer to see in their investments. There is a 90 day resale exemption
period. The resale exemption for sales to accredited investors, among other conditions, requires
that the class have been in existence for 90 days. Therefore, the 90 day resale exemption period
meaning there will be no orders to purchase within this period. The 90 days begins after the first
IJNTR/ETN asset is minted. Once the 90 day resale exemption period ends, investors can go
through Jointer's exchange partners to purchase JNTR/ETN from other investors at the market

rate.

45
Due Date

JNTR/ETN is similar to an ETN with a 5-year due date. This means Jointer must buyback the
outstanding JNTR/ETN value on or before 5-years, otherwise, the INTR/ETN asset holder will have
a claim for equity in Jointer (via JNTR/STOCK). The claim is at the valuation of their INTR/ETN
assets. Therefore, it is in Jointer’s best interest to repay the digital ETN (JNTR/ETN) before the due
date.

Jointer has the right, at any time before the due date, to call the note and payback investors the
outstanding value of the JNTR/ETN.

JINTR/ETN Conversions

JNTR/ETN tokens have conversion relationships to both INTR/NOTE and JNTR/STOCK.

46
How does Jointer ensure JNTR/ETN
payback?

In the case that users convert their JNTR/NOTE to JNTR/ETN and the JNTR/NOTE
value over time is stays EQUAL to JNTR/ETN, Jointer should have enough funds
available to payoff the outstanding JNTR/ETN.

In the case that users convert their JNTR/NOTE to JNTR/ETN and the JNTR/NOTE
value over time becomes GREATER than JNTR/ETN, Jointer should have enough
funds available to payoff the outstanding JNTR/ETN.

In the case that users convert their JNTR/NOTE to JNTR/ETN and the JNTR/NOTE
value over time becomes LESS than JNTR/ETN, Jointer will have to use the
properties’ profits and other available funds as a source of liquidity to buy more
INTR/NOTE from the market. Jointer has a 10 year window (until the due date) to
pay off the outstanding JNTR/ETN value, before Jointer is obligated to convert the
INTR/ETN to JNTR/STOCK (equity). Once the JNTR/ETN is converted to JNTR/STOCK
the JNTR/ETN holder will have a piece from Jointer’s real estate and income streams

by holding shares of Jointer.

Regulation

From a regulatory perspective, JNTR/ETN is akin to an ETN. Therefore, KYC and AML will be

performed on all token holders which will place their wallet on the whitelist. Once on the

whitelist. Once on the whitelist, they can buy and sell INTR/ETN. Jointer will periodically check

AML through partner API's to ensure all regulatory needs are met.

Taxation

INTR/ETN is an intangible asset, therefore, persons holding citizenship and residence outside of

the United States are only subject to capital gains taxes in their own countries.

47
Target Investors

cross-collateral and receive returns calculated by providing 2X leverage on the proven Global
Select All REIT Index. Those seeking safe exposure to the commercial real estate market, as well
as conservative Hedge Funds, Institutional Banks, etc. may see JNTR/ETN best fits their needs

from the Jointer Economy.

JNTR/ETN Quick Facts

INTR/ETN’s face value changes daily.

INTR/ETN can be purchased or redeemed at any time for JNTR/NOTE assets.

INTR/ETN has 10 years due date which is to be paid off by Jointer or converted to
INTR/STOCK.

QO ODODE

Jointer can payback the JNTR/ETN at any given time before the due date at the

token’s face value.

Jointer. JINTR/STOCK changes value based on

Jointer's valuation as a company. Jointer has INTR/STOCK
. . . . _ DIGITAL PREFERRED STOCK
multiple profit sources which are publicly visible ‘Value Based on Company Valtiation

and verifiable on the blockchain.

49
How Jointer Earns Value

Jointer as a company has a few ways of sourcing income.

Management fee

Jointer receives 2% of JNTR assets as a Management fee on top of the ongoing daily token

supply.

Example:
If day X has supply of 10,000,000 JNTR/NOTE the smart contract will mint total of 10,204,081
JINTR/NOTE assets, 10,000,000 will go to contributors and 204,081 JNTR/NOTE will go to Jointer.

* Since Jointer invests 100% of the daily contribution in commercial real estate, the management
fee is needed to maintain the day to day operational costs. Jointer maintains the right to adjust
to management fee if needed. Jointer will be transparent with the community about this

change if it will take place.

Carry

Jointer earns a carry by subtracting 10% from Investor's index returns.

Example:
If the index performs at 10% a year after 2x leverage, the investor would make 20% and minus

Jointer's 10% carry, the net profit for investors is 18%

Property Investment

Jointer earns dual profits on the property appreciation plus retains the down payment
investment (the principal). On top of appreciation, Jointer will also benefit monthly from the
income streams those properties generate. Income streams from properties will be converted to

stablecoins.

IJNTR/NOTE Asset Purchase

Jointer uses 10% from the daily contribution to purchase JNTR/NOTE assets from the reserve
buyback program. When JNTR/NOTE's face value increases it will empower Jointer's value as

well.
50
JNTR/STOCK Minting

Jointer will pre-mine 1,000,000 JNTR/STOCK tokens.
Ongoing minting occurs when investors purchase the token using JNTR/NOTE.
Example:

At the time Bob converts JNTR/NOTE tokens at market value of $100, Jointer mints INTR/STOCK

assets at the face value of $100.

JNTR/STOCK Burning

INTR/STOCK is burned when Jointer buybacks JNTR/STOCK from investors.

Example:
At the time Barbara converts JNTR/STOCK assets at market value of $100, Jointer burns
INTR/STOCK assets at the face value of $100.

Purchasing JNTR/STOCK

Investors have the ability to purchase JNTR/STOCK assets in two ways:

1) Secondary Market Exchange

[2 ) SmartSwap

Secondary Market Exchange

Jointer is in the process of finding suitable exchanges to host the JNTR/STOCK assets. Jointer will
provide fully transparent information to allow the public to set the fair JNTR/STOCK market value

on exchanges based on Jointer assets and performance.

Investors that buy JNTR/STOCK from Secondary Market Exchanges are required to go through
KYC and AML based on Reg S while investors from US and regulated countries investors will

need to also conduct full accreditation checks based on Reg D 506 (c).

51
Secondary market exchanges will be able to offer to investors trading within 90 days after the
first INTR/STOCK sold.

Disclosure: Jointer will respect the market price for INTR/STOCK first. The fixed floor is based on

the value of Jointer’s assets which will be verifiable on the blockchain.

Arbitration opportunity

Even if investors use a secondary market exchange to purchase their JNTR/STOCK above or
below it’s respected index calculated price, Jointer still will value the JNTR/STOCK equally.
Therefore, investors will have the opportunity for arbitrage buying and selling between

exchanges and the value Jointer redeems the JNTR/STOCK.

SmartSwap

Jointer will allow users to swap their JNTR/STOCK through SmartSwap which is powered by
ElementZero. (Jointer's subsidiary company) SmartSwap allows users to swap their INTR/STOCK
assets with other same face value assets such as ETH, fiat backed stablecoins and more. The
SmartSwap is a decentralized swap solution based on _ Peer-to-Peer and
Peer-to-Communitybuilt on Ethereum. The trustless SmartSwap provides a way to swap
cryptocurrencies without using a hot wallet while guaranteeing an exact face value match.

SmartSwap's crypto-to-crypto swaps are precise, low risk, and 100% fee-free.

Swap trading also falls under the 90 day resale exemption set out by the SEC. The locked period
will end after 90 days.

SmartSwap P2P

SmartSwap Peer-2-Peer allows users to generate a transaction ID that can be sent directly to a
specific person they want to swap with. Once the transaction ID is created and the users send
their coins to that transaction ID, the swap will be available only to the party that know about the
transaction ID address. After the swap take place, the SmartSwap will swap the same face value

and if any delta, it will be returned to whom it belongs

52
Example:

Bob wants to swap $1,000 JNTR/STOCK with $1,000 ETH.
Bob sends his order to the SmartSwap and generates the transaction ID for the P2P swap.
Bob shares that transaction ID with his friend Lisa.

Since Lisa only sent $500 ETH against Bob's JNTR/STOCK, the SmartSwap will execute the
order of $500 JNTR/e against $500 ETH.

The $500 JNTR/STOCK delta SmartSwap will return back to Bob's wallet.

SmartSwap P2C

SmartSwap Peer-2-Community allows users to swap coins without the need to identify or know
who the other party or parties are. SmartSwap will search one or more other parties to swap with
as one transaction if possible or many if needed. In case one transaction is not enough to cover
the face value of the swap, the SmartSwap will perform a partial swap first and then keep the rest
of the funds pending until more potential swaps are identified. Users with pending funds are
allowed to cancel the outstanding portion of the trade and receive back the funds to the same

wallet it was sent from.

Example:

Bob wants to swap $1,000 JNTR/STOCK with $1,000 ETH.

Bob sends his order to SmartSwap and SmartSwap immediately identifies one person that
wants to swap $500 ETH against JNTR/STOCK.

In this case, Bob will get the first $500 ETH and the rest of the $500 JNTR/STOCK will stay
pending until the SmartSwap will identify more users that want to swap ETH with
INTR/STOCK.

Selling JNTR/STOCK

Secondary Market Exchange

Jointer is in the process of finding suitable exchanges to host the JNTR/STOCK assets. Jointer will
provide fully transparent information to allow the public to set the fair INTR/STOCK market value

based on Jointer assets and performance.

Secondary market exchanges will be able to offer to investors trading within 90 days after the
first INTR/STOCK is sold.

53
Yearly Buyback

As long as Jointer is a private company (complying with Regulation D), the company must
implement a yearly buyback to clear the CAP table for JNTR/STOCK shareholders. Every year
before December 31, a buyback may be initiated to comply with the 2,000 investors limit set out

in U.S. Regulations.

At the end of the year, Jointer will initiate a swap of all JNTR/STOCK assets in exchange for
INTR/NOTE. At this point, investors have the right to redeem the JNTR/NOTE assets for other
types of value through the reserve (such as crypto or stablecoin), sell on a secondary exchange,
and during the beginning of January, after a short holding period, Jointer may hold an event for
all users to convert back from JNTR/NOTE to JNTR/STOCK based on the JNTR/NOTE market

value at that time.

Jointer keeps the right to initiate the swap on a select number of INTR/STOCK holders. In such a
case, Jointer will allow the 2,000 biggest JNTR/STOCK holders to maintain their position if they so

choose.

Regulation

From a regulatory perspective, INTR/STOCK is Preferred Stock. Therefore, KYC and AML will be
performed on all token holders which will place their wallet on the whitelist. Once on the
whitelist, they can buy and sell INTR/STOCK. Jointer will periodically check AML through partners

to ensure all regulatory needs are met.

Target Investors

Jointer designed JNTR/STOCK for investors that are seeking an upside in Jointer as a startup.

sale

Jointer Auction

The Jointer Auction is an open-ended fund used to invest in real estate and provide liquidity to
the reserve. The auction will run daily on a continuous basis. During each day investors can

contribute to the fund and earn JNTR/NOTE assets individually and as a group.

Each day, contributors have the opportunity to invest as much or as little as they desire while

still benefiting from the purchasing power of the whole group.

The date the auction begins is known as the “commencement date.” Jointer's

commencement date is yet to be determined but will be announced by the company when

known.

The Auction is ongoing fundraising under US Regulation D 506(c) and Reg S for investors
outside of the United States.

55
Use of Funds

The proceeds that are received during the Jointer Auction set up a robust ecosystem to
benefit Jointer investors. Jointer puts 100% of the invested dollars to work through

Commercial Real Estate investment and the liquidity reserve.

56
Reserve Governance and Redemption

Jointer's Liquidity Reserve is powered by smart contracts and executed through the well-
established Bancor relay protocol. As funds are received from investors, 10% is used to support

the reserve.

Establishing the Liquidity Reserve

To establish Jointer’s Bancor Reserve, Jointer will purchase BNT and distribute JNTR/NOTE assets
to the reserve. This action will be done at a 1:1 face value ratio. Redemption from the reserve will

start on Day 1 of the Auction.

Ongoing Distribution

10% from funds Jointer receives during the auction will be allocated to purchase JNTR/NOTE

assets from the reserve automatically using a smart contract.

This action will remove from the reserve JNTR/NOTE assets that have been redeemed by users
and asa result of that, liquidity will increase and keeping the JNTR/NOTE asset's face value strong

against redemption.

Redemption from the Liquidity Reserve

Redemption from Jointer’s Reserve follows the Bancor Relay protocol to help provide more
liquidity for investors. Investors are able to redeem through the JNTR web-page instantly without

needing to trade.

Jointer Auction

Establishing and Setting Goals

The goal of each Auction day is based on the total amount of funds raised on the day before. The
amount raised becomes the goal. This process repeats itself daily, always setting the goal based

on the previous day's fundraising amount at the conclusion of the auction.

Establish the First Goal Setting Daily Goals
DAY » DAY

3 $4,900,000 $10,000,000
4 $10,000,000 $12,000,000

The goal on Auction Day 1 will be set by Jointer, and after Day 1, daily goals are set by the market,

not Jointer.

Minting

If the auction meets the daily goal amount, the token supply minted the following day will
increase by 1%. By increasing the daily-allotted auction supply mint, Jointer is ensuring the
strength of fund and token. If an auction does not meet the previous days goals, the minted
supply will decrease by the % amount short of the goal. So if investors fell 10% short of the goal,
the following days allotted auction supply mint will decrease from 100,000 JNTR/NOTE by 10% to
90,000 JNTR/NOTE.

December 31 - Super Auction

On December 31, Jointer will celebrate our holders with a Super Auction. We will buyback
JINTR/STOCK and JNTR/ETN tokens, converting with JNTR/NOTE. After such time, we will host a

large community bonus event to allow all JNTR/NOTE holders to increase their holdings.

Further details about the December 31 Super Auction will be released some time prior to the
date.

Initial Qualifications

Jointer's fundraising takes place under US Regulation D 506(c). Therefore, certain qualifications
must be met and processes must be followed in order to participate. Prior to submitting any bid

in the Jointer Auction, the contributors must be qualified by meeting the following conditions:

e = Allcontributors will complete any on-boarding procedures established by Jointer or Jointer’s

partners, including AML/KYC review.

@ Contributors that belong the regulated countries such as the US will need to comply with

Rule S506(c) of Regulation D of the Securities Act.

@ Contributors will use their own Ethereum wallet (at the moment we support MetaMask) to
contribute ETH or EZO (beta) stablecoin. INTR/NOTE will be sent back to the same wallet

contributions have been accepted from.

@ Jointer will allow contributors also the option to transfer the desired amount of funds they
wish to contribute (whether it is Bitcoin, Ether, or fiat) to a designated escrow account estab-

lished by the escrow agents engaged by the company.

Social Impact

Jointer realizes social impact reaches beyond access to instill positive change. Blockchain has the
potential to empower the furthest reaches of the world and provide opportunity where little has
existed. Like Satoshi Nakomoto’s selfless gift to the world with Bitcoin, grand innovations carry a
large responsibility to execute for the people. Jointer has followed this creed since Day One and
is out of a need for a decentralized coin, created its own, Element Zero, and made it a

not-for-profit to ensure long-term decentralized success.

Overview —-— Jude’s WHY

Jointer’s founder, Jude G. Regev, grew up in Israel in a middle-class family where no matter how hard his
parents worked, they seemed to barely survive their financial responsibilities. For decades, they woke up
every morning to yet another day of survival, paying their taxes, following the rules, and trying to stay

optimistic about the future. They continually had hope that something would change for them.

But life moved on so fast that without noticing it, they became old and the optimism they had in their youth
disappeared. They had to face a cold reality that much of the rest of the world already knew, that even with
all their hard work a middle-class family they could never keep up with the increasing costs of living,

especially when their entire savings was held in the bank with a return less than the rate of inflation

And the ability to find a job or keep working faded until it completely disappeared. From that point on, they
feared the last thing every decent person would want, they became dependent on government programs

and, even harder, dependent on their own kids to survive.

Jude saw this unfold and will never forget how his parents refused financial support from their kids,
although he and his siblings wanted to help. They were determined and believed that after all their years of
work, at least some support from the government would arrive, keeping them independent and proud. But
time and again, the optimism they had in the system was crushed. Forced to beg for government's help,
the system turned hard on them and treated them like insurance companies treat their clients when they

submit a claim, hoping they will give up first due to the misery of bureaucracy.

These events broke his parents’ spirits, and it did not take long until their bodies responded with high stress
and health issues. Jude and his siblings still support his parents today, but no matter how much money they
give them, nothing can give them back their self-respect or their shattered optimism. On reflection, for
Jude’s parents, as a non-sophisticated middle-class family, it was always a lost cause, a race against time
losing to the inevitability of inflation while all the financial vehicles to generate fortunes are limited to rich,
sophisticated, and well connected investors like the banks that leverage Jude's parents savings for their

own benefit, turning the world into an unfair race.

This is the same race many other families around the world are losing to every day. When Jointer was
created, not only that it was clear to Jude that Jointer needed to be available to any person, even those
without knowledge or fortune, also since Jointer needed a truly decentralized stablecoin as a way of
payment. After searching for a solution, Jointer was unable to find an answer so it created, the Element Zero
stability protocol. After Jude realized there is a high chance Element Zero stablecoins may become a
powerful worldwide currency, he immediately understood that no matter how much Element Zero could
be worth, it can never be controlled by a small group of rich people or few governments. It must be a
not-for-profit organization and it must belong to the citizens of the world, all in the hope that it will help

reduce the financial stress for other families and individuals while helping those in need by channeling net

profits to non-profit organizations dedicated to social good.

67
Regulations

Rule 506(c) of Regulation D, Section 201(a) of the JOBS Act

Section 201(a) of the JOBS Act requires the SEC to eliminate the prohibition on using general
solicitation under Rule 506. This rule indicates that where all purchasers of the securities must be
accredited investors and the issuer will take reasonable steps to verify that purchasers are

accredited investors.

To implement Section 201(a), the SEC adopted paragraph (c) of Rule 506. Under Rule 506(c),

issuers can offer securities through means of general solicitation, provided that:

All purchasers in the offering are accredited investors; the issuer takes reasonable steps to verify

their accredited investor status and that certain other conditions in Regulation D are satisfied.

Non-Accredited Investors

In regulated countries such as the US, there are two options for non-accredited investors to buy

Jointer tokens:

J. Purchase them from an accredited investor via a security exchange in the secondary
market. In this situation, accredited investors are subject to holding their securities for 12

months before they can sell them to non-accredited investors.

2. Once Jointer completes the registration of its public offering of securities, and those
securities are registered with the SEC and the SO states, anyone will be able to buy and sell

the registered securities.

Note: Non-accredited investors from non-regulated countries can freely purchase Jointer's
tokens without restriction. To check if your country has regulations consult with your local legal

representative.

68
Risk Factors

e Aswith any digital/cryptocurrency, purchasing Jointer tokens involves a high degree of risk.

Those who cannot risk losing their entire purchase should not buy these tokens.

e@ The ability to transfer the coins is subject to a secondary market for digital securities
functioning. If there is no secondary market in which to sell the coins, investors could be left

holding them in perpetuity.
e@ The tokens have no voting rights or ability to direct the company or its actions.

@ Government changes to the current regulations or tax code changes could impact our
results. It’s also possible that regulators from the jurisdictions in which a purchaser of Jointer
tokens reside may—after the purchase of the coins—conduct investigations and take
regulatory action. Additionally, it could become prohibited for the secondary market to sell

or purchase Jointer tokens.

@ Residents of certain jurisdictions may not be permitted to purchase cryptocurrencies or
digital tokens. In some cases, even participating in a purchase may be illegal in certain
jurisdictions. New or revised legislation, regulations, guidelines, and directives may be

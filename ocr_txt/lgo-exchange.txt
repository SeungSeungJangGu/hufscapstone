Abstract

The crypto community has been plagued by opaque and unprincipled exchanges.
Improving and strengthening these fundamental links within the community must be front
and center.

With cryptocurrencies emerging as a legitimate asset class, financial institutions are
working on entering this growing market, but they currently lack the tools to make large
investments that remain in line with their security and transparency needs.

Within this context, Legolas Exchange is committed to creating a trustworthy,
demonstrably fair and bank-backed premium protocol where traders and investors, small
and large, can transact without doubting the integrity and robustness of the platform or its
order management system.

Legolas Exchange’s protocol incorporates a decentralized ledger within its proprietary
centralized platform in order to neutralize front-running, guarantee the inalterability,
temporality and transparency of the order book, and ensure a fair trading environment.
Led by an experienced team of financiers and successful entrepreneurs, Legolas Exchange
has partnered with global brokerage firm Makor Capital. Makor operates a broker dealer
business trading under 2 brand names, Makor Securities London Limited, regulated by the

FCA, and Oscar Gruss and Son Inc, regulated by FINRA and the NFA. Makor will

provide Legolas Exchange customers with custody of their deposits at major banks, and

access to hundreds of financial institutions already onboarded.

Legolas Exchange aspires to become the reference in terms of security and compliance for

all crypto exchanges.
t. Shortfalls of Existing Exchanges

Existing crypto exchanges present numerous important flaws and limitations.

With no alternatives, the community is forced to accept opacity, capped or slow
transactions, and the risk of catastrophic losses.

Institutional investors who cannot overlook these concerns are locked out of the market

and the trillions of dollars it represents.

1.1 Lack of Security

iit Bitcoin Theft

Millions of bitcoins have been stolen from crypto exchanges since Bitcoin’s creation.
Lacking guarantees and insurance, hacked crypto exchanges decline responsibility for
stolen bitcoins. An example of this is the Mt. Gox case in which the company said it had
lost almost 750,000 of its customers’ bitcoins and around 100,000 of its own bitcoins,
totaling around 7% of all bitcoins, worth around $473 million at the time. Mt. Gox released
a statement stating that, "the company believes there is a high possibility that the bitcoins
were stolen,” blamed hackers, and began a search for the missing bitcoins. Chief Executive
Karpelés said technical issues left an opening for fraudulent withdrawals. After he was
interrogated, Japanese prosecutors accused him of misappropriating Y315m ($2.6m) in
bitcoins deposited into trading accounts by investors at Mt. Gox and moving it into an
account he controlled approximately six months before Mt. Gox failed in early 2014.

This case is only one of the most well documented, and there have been numerous other
situations where crypto assets deposited at exchanges were lost or stolen. A significant risk
still exists today, and it is widely agreed that due to complacency and a lack of better
alternatives all major exchanges currently lack the proper security to adequately protect

customers’ deposits.

1.1.2 Weak Authentication

Existing exchanges operate in a login/password paradigm. Even though some “verified
account” solutions exist, many traders have faced locked accounts, credential problems and
even incorrect balances on their account. Furthermore, most financial institutions are set
up in such a way that money managers serve as investment advisors to their investors and

are required to follow dual signature rules whereby administrator are signatory to all
outside transactions. Existing 2 factor authorization policies are a step in the right

direction but do not satisfy institutional compliance and security needs.

1.1.3 No Deposit Security or Recourse

An obvious drawback to most existing exchanges is that they create their own rules and
require a large degree of trust from investors and traders.

Running contrary to many principles of “trust-less” applications, traders who deposit
cryptocurrencies and digital assets on exchanges may have no recourse should the
exchanges choose to change the rules, keep some bitcoins locked for one reason or another,
or even disappear altogether.

Additionally, communicating and resolving disputes with exchanges when the residence of

the holding company is in an unreachable tax haven can be unnecessarily difficult.

1.4 Large Fiat Transactions Are Laborious

There are only a handful of crypto exchanges in the world that accept real fiat deposits and
withdrawals, and all of them have some or all of the following attributes: lengthy
onboarding process, high fees, and delays of up to a week for buying bitcoins with fiat (in
conjunction with an unknown and sometimes evidently unfair execution price). Fiat
transactions are also constrained to a certain amount, ranging from a few thousands to a
few tens of thousands of dollars, per 24-hour period.

In addition to these problems, withdrawing fiats to a bank account from a crypto exchange
is also challenging with most banks and financial institution questioning the wires, often

rejecting them and even Cc osing customers’ bank accounts.

These limits are an obstac eto many large investors and traders who are looking to move

hundreds of thousands or millions in a short amount of time.
1.2 Price Manipulation

1.2.1 What is Front Running?

Front running is the unethical practice of a broker trading an equity in his personal
account based on advanced knowledge of pending orders from the brokerage firm or from
clients, thus allowing him to profit from the knowledge. In other words, front running is a
practice that consists in placing orders before someone else does based on advanced
knowledge of their transaction.

FINRA (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority) regulates front running within the

6
traditional financial market but such regulations remain insufficient when it comes to
protecting holders. The concept of “no evil seen, no evil done” hinders any possibility of
action. Moreover these rules and regulations are difficult to keep up to date with the fast
paced, constantly evolving technology. FINRA’s latest 5270 tule, which addresses
front-running block transactions, took 4 years to implement.

The 2016 HSBC scandal, among others, is only the tip of the iceberg and proves that the
only efficient means of prevention lies in technologies making such practices impossible.

Legolas Exchange’s protocol provides the technological means to combat front-running of

block transactions. It is absolutely necessary and is the optimal way to achieve
transparency in cryptocurrency trading and, on a larger scale, the whole financial

ecosystem.

1.2.2 Crypto Exchanges and Front Running

Crypto exchanges are best positioned to profit from front-running practices: they can
insert their own buy order before a trader’s large buy order and sell the bought asset right
after the trader's order is executed.

The trader winds up paying more for his purchase and the exchange has pocketed a
substantial profit piggybacking off the trader. Large order dark pools, like the one
proposed by Kraken Exchange, are particularly exposed to front running.

Forums like Reddit, Bitcointalk and Steemit show hundreds of instances of users of crypto
exchanges complaining about suspected front running. Even though the allegations are
impossible to prove because of the complete opaqueness of the order book, the mere

possibility isa large deterrent for large and sophisticated investors.

1.2.3 No Transparent Price Formation

The issues mentioned above are major obstacles to transparent price evaluation and,
consequently, to the creation of financial products like ETE.

On March 10, 2017, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission denied a request to list
what would have been the first U.S. exchange-traded fund built to track Bitcoin. In its
statement, the SEC stated, "the Commission is disapproving this proposed rule change
because it does not find the proposal to be consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange
Act, which requires, among other things, that the rules of a national securities exchange be
designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to protect
investors and the public interest." In other words, the commission found that the proposed

fund was too susceptible to fraud.
In their report on virtual currencies, the EBA (European Banking Authority) listed a
detailed number of possible regulatory responses to the challenges posed by virtual
currencies. One of the main proposals is: “Transparent price formation and requirements
against market abuse. To avoid market manipulation and insider trading, intermediaries
must comply with existing regulation against such practices in the financial sector.”

It is crucial for modern exchanges to unquestionably prove that they cannot

practice market manipulation. With its hybrid protocol, Legolas Exchange provides an

elegant solution to this important issue.

1.3 Lack of Transparency

Most crypto exchanges don't provide any reports and are never audited by independent
authorities. Moreover, the financial audit process has traditionally been opaque, operating
in a black box environment with only a pass or fail judgement rendered by the auditor on
an annual basis. A number of initiatives are underway internationally aiming to increase
transparency of the audit process. However, Legolas Exchange believes that the only
efficient means of reporting rests with technologies making every exchanges operation

traceable in a public blockchain.

1.4 Latency Problem

Differences in connection quality can also make trading unfair in existing exchanges: trader
bots with good connections can see order books more quickly and can, therefore, react
appropriately more quickly. In doing so, they gain an unfair edge over most exchange
users. The problem is particularly acute during rallies when exchange throughput limits are
reached. As a result of the uneven playing field created by low latency traders, institutional
investors may choose or be forced to avoid investing in certain parts of the market because
they cannot receive the guarantees they need for fair and transparent price discovery and

execution.

2. Legolas Exchange’s Solution

Legolas’s mission is to create a fair and ideal environment for institutional investors and
other large investors to manage and invest in cryptocurrencies and digital assets. To this
end, Legolas Exchange uses novel blockchain-based technology to guarantee fairness and
transparency of the order book. The security, as well as auditing, reporting and analytical

needs are met in the safest and most efficient Way.
Additionally, thanks to its partnership with the regulated firm Makor Securities, Legolas

will be able to offer fiat custody solutions for clients at major banks.

2.1 Security measures

2.1.1 Theft Proof Wallets and Features

Legolas will leverage its partnerships with Makor Securities, Oscar Gruss and Ledger to
provide the following security features:

Custody of clients’ fiat deposits: A regulated broker, Makor has existing custodian
relationships with most global banks such as Merrill Lynch. Legolas and Makor will
custody Legolas Exchange clients at a major global bank.

Advanced multisig and secure terminals: Optional features based on multi-signature will
be available to control active and cold storage. We will work with several Hardware Wallets
and hardware manufacturers to offer optional secure terminals/displays to validate orders.
Segregated custody of cryptocurrencies: Dedicated HSM storage will be available as an
optional service for clients.

Authentication: Simple login+password access type will not be allowed on Legolas. Legolas
will enforce secure 2FA protection with FIDO U2F’ support or client certificates’. By
default, weak 2FA like OTP/Google Authenticator/Authy/SMS won't be authorized or will
be only temporarily tolerated, since these methods are vulnerable to phishing attacks’.
Active storage and cold storage: These are guaranteed by different certified HSM
(Hardware Security Module), thanks to our partnership with Ledger’.

Legolas Exchange clients will be given a key ona2 of 3 multisig wallet, along with Legolas
Exchange and a Trusted Third Party. The key given to the third party will be stored in a
Ledger cold wallet, itself stored in a bank safe. Should the client lose her key, the stored key
will be retrieved from the bank, ensuring complete security of the funds.

Tailor-made solutions: For customers with special requirements imposed by law or by
pre-existing processes, Legolas will build dedicated access control.

Secure Web services: Highly available, redundant, customized DDoS shielded hosting
solution with network and application levels firewalls. Legolas will use secure HTTP

headers like HSTS to enforce TLS encryption, CSP & X-XSS-P to avoid/mitigate XSS

Secure company policies: Strict role-based and attributes-based access control rules. No
all-in-one-person privileged accounts. No direct access to assets (private keys are securely
stored in HSM inside securely guarded and distributed hosting provider facilities).
Security audits and certifications: Unbiased zero-knowledge orders encryption is done
through keys provided by CertEurope® PKI-on-blockchain services. We are planning to

pass regular external audits and to obtain security certifications delivered by ANSSI’.

2.1.2 Large Fiat, Crypto Deposits and Withdrawals

Legolas Exchange's clients will be able to deposit and withdraw both fiat currencies and

cryptocurrencies. Legolas Exchange and Makor will create a reliable, scalable and secure

deposit and withdrawal system.

quantities will be a game changer for the community anda gateway to unleashing vast new

inflows.
2.2 Blockchain Technology on top of the Centralized Exchange

2.2.1 Front-running Proof

Legolas Exchange’s protocol uses blockchain properties to determine the position ofa given
order in the order queue. To achieve this, a user’s order is first encrypted and then sent to
the blockchain. Once a block is confirmed, the order sequence is engraved into the
blockchain. At this point, it becomes impossible to insert an order into the order queue,
and the private key corresponding to the public key used to encrypt the order is published

in the blockchain. Thus, temporality of the orders is strictly respected and the possibility of

front running is neutralized. Legolas Exchange is the first demonstrably fair exchange and

is wholly in compliance with financial standards regarding transparency.

2.2.2 Traceability and Auditability
In addition, all operations done on Legolas Exchange - orders, transactions, withdrawals
and deposits - are engraved in the blockchain. Cryptocurrency deposits and withdrawals

are recorded in their respective blockchain. Thanks to our privileged partnership with

Makor, all fiat deposits and wit hdrawals are communicated to and from Makor using the

Legolas Exchange’s platform is designed to be completely auditable by regulators and can

provide proof of reserve and audit reports in real time.

2.2.3 Latency: A Level Playing Field for All Market Participants

The very short delay necessary for validating a block can be perceived, at first, as a
limitation when in fact it adds fairness to the trading process. Indeed, a block behaves like
a pool, randomly ordering all transactions done during the validation time. Therefore,
traders using a fast internet connection or those who are closer to the exchange data center
don’t have an advantage over traders with slower connections or who are located farther
away. The race against the clock is mainly used to practice front running. It becomes less
relevant on Legolas Exchange, where it is neutralized. However Legolas Exchange’s
platform is blockchain agnostic and, beyond classic networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum, it
can be plugged into the latest blockchains, reaching several hundred thousand transactions

per seconds (block.one, Assembly...).

3.1 Protocol

The Legolas Protocol is a semi decentralized order matching protocol.

Incoming orders and transactions are encrypted, timestamped and stored in a blockchain,
while order matching is made off-chain.

The decentralization of orders and transactions information allows for transparent price
formation, transaction auditability, and zero front-running. Centralization of order

pooling and order matching leads to efficiency and scalability, bypassing current

blockchain limitations.

Order Pool

1) Ineach batch, the independent and certified PKI publishes a public key anda

private key in the blockchain. The public key can be used by anyone to encrypt and

publish data in the next batch. The private key can be used by anyone to decrypt

the data published in the previous batch.

2) Trader retrieves the public key for the next batch from the blockchain.

3) Trader encrypts his order and a random number with public key and sends the

encrypted order to the Order Pool. Orders in the Order Pool are encrypted and are

ordered by timestamp, which makes front running impossible as price and volume

information are not made available to the Exchange.

4) All encrypted orders in the Order Pool are hashed and published in the blockchain.

Once a block is confirmed:

5) Order Queue Engine retrieves the private key for the previous batch from the

blockchain.

6) Order Queue Engine asks the Order Pool for all encrypted orders corresponding to

the hash published in the blockchain in step 4.

%
7) Order Queue Engine randomly sorts encrypted orders in the following manner:
each encrypted order is concatenated with the block’s hash and hashed. The
resulting hashes are sorted alphabetically. Once orders are sequenced, Order Queue
Engine decrypts them and sends them to Matching Engine and Backend.

8) Matching Engine sends completed trades to Backend. In addition, trade logs are
sent to the Blockchain where they are safely stored.

9) User Interface communicates with Backend to display order books, latest trades,

and all other relevant information.

3.1.3 High Throughput

Each block on a blockchain is able to contain a limited amount of information, which
currently creates limitations and bottlenecks as soon as the activity on the platform grows
beyond network capacity. Blockchain’s low throughput is therefore a major obstacle for
trading because delaying a client’s order due to technological limitations is unacceptable.
Legolas Exchange solves this problem via an Order Pool system: instead of sending orders

to the blockchain one ata time, the Order Pool sends a hash of all encrypted orders to the

blockchain. This way a single hash code is sent to every block, and an unlimited number of

orders per block can be achieved. It is important to stress that the orders being pooled are

encrypted, their timestamp and their hash being the only information visible to the pool.
This scaling method can be compared to what the Bitcoin Community is developing

through the Lightning Network.
3.2 The Exchange

3.2.1 User Interface
A fast and responsive trading user interface using the latest Javascript technology.
NodeJS will be used for the backend and ReactJS for the frontend. This stack has already

proven its robustness and ability to support a large number of simultaneous connections. A

vibrant community and ecosystem ensures the sustainability of this powerful stack.

3.2.2 Matching engine

The first version of the matching engine will support the following types of orders:
- — limit orders
- market orders

- stop-loss orders

4
and the following matching algorithms:
- FIFO
-  Pro-rata
- Market Maker Allocation
The part allocated to each algorithm will be decided after consultation with the LGO
holders.
The ratio allocated to market makers will ensure fair trading without penalizing market

makers.

3.2.3 Blockchain

The Legolas Exchange platform is designed to be ledger agnostic: it can easily be plugged
into any blockchain. The beta version of Legolas Exchange will use the Ethereum network
but as soon as Legolas goes live with its current production system, the best blockchains
will be used. Moreover, Legolas Exchange’s development team is currently studying the use

of a much faster public ledger: the Byzantine Fault Tolerant.

3.2.4 REST and Websocket APIs

The Legolas Exchange platform will provide a RESTFull API to consult the order book and

make orders. A Websocket API will provide the latest trades and orders in real time.
3.4 Full Stack Tools and Functionalities

3.4.1 Custom Reports

One of the most crucial tools that Legolas Exchange will provide is a full track record of
past investments and trades and how they performed, enabling customers to sort and
filter their data using various metrics, both visual and analytical. These reporting tools and
visuals are commonly available on prime stock broker portals, and Legolas Exchange will
replicate many of the same functionalities. Legolas Exchange’s reports will be available via
CSV and an API and will meet the requirements and needs of all customers, from day
traders to long term holders to large financial institutions. The data will be stored in both

a centralized server and on the blockchain.

3.4.2 Portfolio Analysis Tools

With Legolas Exchange, customers will have access to custom made analysis tools, such as

profit & loss per trades, time period, type of digital asset, and volume. A full visual of the

15
portfolio value will also be available using sorting options by digital asset, market
capitalization, balances, realized and unrealized gains. The Legolas Exchange team plans to
develop additional tools over time, with the goal of providing customers with valuable
analysis and analytics enabling them to improve their trading strategies and optimize their

investment returns.

3.4.3 ICO Participation Functionalities

Sophisticated crypto investors may be interested in participating in an ICO. Legolas
Exchange will allow its customers to benefit from a wide spectrum of investment options,
including in-depth analysis of upcoming ICOs and exclusive large-volume discounts on
investments made during pre-ICO phases. Furthermore, there is no minimum investment
amount required, Legolas Exchanges values each investor, independently of the investment

size.

3.4.4 Tax Documents and Audit Log

For institutional clients and others who request it, Legolas Exchange will have an opt-in
functionality that lets clients keep a detailed log of all transactions in order to
automatically create tax documents. It will also generate a Capital Gains Report in a
format that is already prepared for accountants and tax offices.

In addition, Legolas Exchange’s platform is designed to be able to provide proof of reserve
and audit reports to institutional customers who may request them for their own auditing

needs.
4. Legolas Exchange Value Proposition

4.1 Current Exchange Landscape

4.1.1 Centralized Exchange

A centralized exchange isa platform that facilitates transactions between cryptocurrencies
and maybe fiat currencies. Transactions between the exchange’s customers are recorded in
the exchange’s internal ledger. Transactions are typically not recorded on a blockchain or
on any outside ledger. There is no transparency and neither the account balance nor the
transaction history can be viewed. The majority of existing crypto exchanges are

centralized exchanges.

16
4.1.2 Decentralized Exchange

A decentralized exchange is a marketplace that matches buyers and sellers on its platform
and facilitates their transaction on a decentralized ledger or blockchain. Trades occur
directly between users (peer to peer) through an automated process facilitated by the
exchange. This system can be achieved, among other solutions that are currently being
developed, by creating proxy tokens (crypto assets that represent a certain fiat or crypto
currency) or assets (that can represent shares in a company for example) or through a
decentralized multi-signatures escrow system.

Fully decentralized exc anges have existed since 2013 with MasterCoin and Counterparty.
Aside from latency issues, one substantial limitation with these existing systems and those
being developed is that transactions cannot occur between different blockchains. As of
now, pairs like ETH/BTC, LTC/BTC, XRP/BTC or BTC/USD are not tradable on a fully

decentralized system since there is no vector to transfer information from one blockchain

to another on a fully decentralized system.

Finally, decentralized exchange projects currently being developed don’t focus on fiat
deposit. We believe that fiat deposit and withdrawal are important functionalities that
must not be overlooked when trying to capture market shares. According to
Coinmarketcap.com, the volume of intra-chain trading represents less than 2% of all

transactions per day.

4.1.3 Legolas Exchange: A Hybrid Model

At Legolas Exchange we have long believed in decentralized ledgers and applications, but
at the same time we also believe not all functionalities should be decentralized.
Decentralized computing wastes energy and can be replaced by centralized computing
combined with decentralized ordered hash storage. Centralization, for its part, isn’t
intrinsically bad and offers some irreplaceable features for real life applications, namely
privacy, speed, simplicity and authority. Legolas Exchange therefore proposes a hybrid
exchange that incorporates features of both centralized and decentralized systems. We are

convinced that a decentralized blockchain can make centralized systems transparent, fair

and, most im portantly, trustworthy.

Fiat: Fiat currencies can be deposited into and withdrawn from the exchange. A fiat
currency is a currency that a government has declared to be legal tender, but which is not
backed by a physical commodity.

External blockchain token: Ability to trade a token for a token in another blockchain.

4.2 Legolas Exchange's Business Model

4.2.1 LGO Token
LGO will be created as an ERC20 compatible token on the Ethereum blockchain. LGO
tokens will be required for any and all Legolas functionalities, deposits, withdrawals,

transactions and analyses.

18
4.2.2 Transaction Fees

Legolas Exchange will not charge any bitcoin or cryptocurrency transaction fee,
commission, or apply extra bid/offer to any order on its platform. Instead, all transactions

will require LGO tokens to be used as fees or fuel to place orders on Legolas Exchange.

4.2.3 Additional Paying Analytical Functionalities

In addition to regular trading, deposit and withdrawal exchange functionalities, Legolas
Exchange will provide customers with opt-in paying analytical functionalities such as, for
example, research, analysis, statistical calculations, recommendations, etc. These

functionalities will be payable in LGO.

4.2.4 LGO Destruction

As Legolas Exchange will charge all fees in LGO, it will accumulate LGOs over time. In

order to reduce the LGO reserve that Legolas Exchange will hold relative to the overall

supply of LGOs, Legolas Exchange will implement a transparent and verified mechanism
that destroys on each trade 25% of all LGO paid to Legolas Exchange as a transaction fee.
As a result, the supply of LGO will decrease over time as the activity on Legolas Exchange

increases, and the demand for each LGO will increase accordingly. LGO will be

subdivisible and fees will be adjusted to always reflect the (balanced) equilibrium sup ply of

LGO.

4.2.5 LGO Liquidity Providers Pool

In order to attract market makers to Legolas Exchange and maximize liquidity for users,
Legolas Exchange will implement a transparent and verified mechanism that transfers 25%
of LGO paid to Legolas Exchange into an LGO Liquidity Providers Pool.

The LGO Liquidity Providers Pool will be redistributed to all market makers and users
who add liquidity to Legolas Exchange order books. Legolas Exchange will charge negative
LGO commission rates to users who add liquidity and adjust those credits over time in
order to keep the LGO Liquidity Providers Pool close to empty at the end of every month.
Overall, 50% of all LGO paid to Legolas Exchange will be either destroyed (25%) or
transferred to the LGO Liquidity Providers Pool.

5. LGO Token Creation

5.1 Pre-sale Information

LGO tokens will be offered in a private, invitation only pre-sale restricted to a selected

group of financial and crypto professionals. A second phase will open the sale to sponsored

5.2 ICO Method

Legolas has made the decision to accept only bitcoins for its ICO. Each buyer has her own
multisig address. Addresses are pre-generated offline using the BIP32 algorithm. This

design Was chosen for the following reasons:

1. Security: Bitcoin multisig is more robust than an Ethereum contract for storing
large amounts.

2. Simplicity: Buyers can send BTC from any address even exchanges like Kraken or
Poloniex.

3. Fairness: Given the volatility of cryptocurrencies, accepting multiple currencies
raises issues of pricing and exchange rates. Buyers using different currencies would

end up paying different prices for the token.

To redeem ICO funds, the signature of a minimum of 2 funders is required.

The server used for the ICO holds no private or public keys, only addresses.

5.3 Round o

Minimum 20% of LGO tokens are reserved for advisors, partners and financial and

cryptocurrency professionals. This ensures that LGO holders are dedicated and involved

21
and not simply speculating. The exact price in Round 0 will be known only at the end of

Rounds I and 2 but will certainly be advantageous. Regardless, at least 20% of the tokens

will be distributed during Round o. To achieve this goal we are using a formula inspired by

convertible notes:

Percentage of total supply sold during the pre-sale:

LGO_SOLD = 68%

Minimum percentage of total supply sold to Round 0 buyers:
J y

MINIMUM_ROUND_@_ PERCENTAGE = 20%

Bonus for Round o buyers:

BONUS_ROUND_@ = 20%

Amount sold during Round o:

CAP_ROUND_@ BEFORE_DISCOUNT = 10@@ BTC

Amount used to calculate the final price:

CAP_ROUND_@ = CAP_ROUND_@ BEFORE_DISCOUNT + BONUS_ROUND_@ = 1200

BTC

Total amount sold during the whole pre-sale:

TOTAL_CAP = CAP_ROUND_@ + CAP_ROUND_1 + CAP_ROUND_2

Percentage distributed to Round o buyers calculated pro rata with the TOTAL_CAP:
ROUND_@_PERCENTAGE_CAP = (CAP_ROUND_@ / TOTAL_CAP) * LGO_SOLD

The final percentage distributed to Round o buyers is the maximum of
ROUND_@_PERCENTAGE_CAP and MINIMUM_ROUND_@ PERCENTAGE:
ROUND_@_PERCENTAGE = MAX(ROUND_@_PERCENTAGE_CAP -
MINIMUM_ROUND_@_ PERCENTAGE )

This algorithm ensures that the price of LGO for Round o buyers will decrease

proportionally to the success of Rounds I and 2

Conversely, it also ensures that the total percentage held by Round o buyers will increase

proportionally to any shortfalls in Rounds I and 2:

5-4 LGO 2-Year Holding Bonus

5% of the initial issuance will be issued each 6 months over 2 years (20% in total). Each time,
the tokens will be distributed to LGO holders who have not sold any LGOs held at the
address where they initially received the tokens. The token will be prorated between LGO
holders who have respected this rule.

This feature is meant as an incentive for participant in the initial LGO token sale to hold

their tokens for at least two years.

5.5 Use of Proceeds

Funding raised through the pre-sale will be used to accelerate the construction of the
Legolas platform. The distribution of funds will, in priority, go towards development,
infrastructure and key hires such as senior developers, system administrators and financial

experts.

ANNEX

1. Financial Institutions Are Embracing Crypto

This year has seen vast capital inflows into crypto currencies. Nevertheless, the amount
pales in comparison to the substantially larger investments that will come from
institutional investors and financial advisors in the months and years ahead. Up to now,
large and professional investors have been missing the security and many of the tools they
need to enter the crypto market. Legolas Exchange is embracing this future inflow and is
offering to build these functionalities to benefit both existing and incoming investors and

traders alike.

t.1 Alternative Investment Is in Vogue

Over the last to years, institutional money managers have been steadily increasing their
holdings in alternative investments in order to diversify their portfolios and increase
expected risk adjusted long term returns. According to PricewaterhouseCooper, by 2020
global assets in alternative investments will grow to US$18.1 trillion, from $10 trillion
today.

This large and growing allocation means that institutional investors such as wealth
managers, endowments, investment funds and sovereign wealth funds are constantly
looking for new asset classes and products that present positive growth expectations.
Crypto currencies and digital tokens are perfectly positioned to be one of the leading

investment class and receive a large proportion of those 18 trillion dollars.

1.2 Cryptocurrencies Are Outperforming Majors Assets by Far

One of the most telling metrics supporting the thesis that financial institution will invest
heavily in crypto currencies is that the performance of cryptocurrencies has lowered the
returns seen by equity benchmarks over the last few years. Bitcoin return has outperformed
the S&P 500 by a factor of 35 since Aptil 2013. Even when using the Sortino ratio, a
measure of risk-adjusted return, Bitcoin has largely outperformed all asset classes over the

last seven years .

29
Bitcoin vs S&P 500 % return,

= Cumulative return BTC += Cumulative return S&P 500

1/2014 1/2015 1/2016 1/2017

1.3 A Near-uncorrelated Asset

Ina globalized world where markets are becoming more interconnected , building a stable
portfolio made of diversified investments is increasingly difficult. Finding uncorrelated
investments is both challenging and incredibly rewarding for an institutional investor
looking to create a diversified portfolio with stable long-term returns.

In this context, one can calculate that the correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500
over the last 5 years is almost o (3% to be exact). This incredibly low correlation is attractive

to large investors as a way of reducing their portfolio risk.

Bitcoin Correlation with S&P 500 - average of only 3%

2013 2014 2015 2016 2017

-1% 1.67% 13.02% -9.20% 6.79%

In fact, Bitcoin can even serve as a hedge against harmful geopolitical events due to its
decentralized nature. There is a growing body of empirical evidence supporting this thesis
with, for example, bitcoin price spiking in response to both Brexit and the election of
Donald Trump.

This calculation can be extended to other financial asset classes such as bonds,
commodities, real estate and currencies with similar results: cryptocurrencies present a
unique combination of positive expected growth and no correlation to established

investment opportunities.

30
u.4 A Growing Demand for Crypto Assets

Digital currencies have found favor among individual investors, but remain a niche
phenomenon among the wider investment community.

The growing demand by all types of investors for digital currencies has had a positive effect
on the financial industry, leading them to view cryptocurrencies and digital assets as a
major new market opportunity for their investors and clients.

One of the best illustrations of this attempt by financial professionals to enter the crypto
market are the many attempts, both successful and unsuccessful, to create indices and
securities that would track the price of Bitcoin or ICO performance. While ETFs
(Exchange Traded Fund) have not been approved in any country yet, several financial
institutions are currently petitioning regulators in North America, the United Kingdom
and continental Europe. Sweden already has an ETN (Exchange Traded Note) tracking the
price of Bitcoin listed on the Stockholm stock exchange with a market capitalization of
$90M.

Seven global banks (BNP Paribas, Societe Generale, CitiBank, Barclays, Goldman Sachs,
Banco Santander, Standard Chartered) have announced plans to integrate future use of
cryptocurrencies.

These evolutions will continue to mature and accelerate in the coming months and years,
opening a flood of investments intro cryptocurrencies and digital assets.

Saxo Bank analyst Kay Van-Petersen estimates that cryptocurrencies will account for 10%
of the average daily volume of fiat currency trades within 10 years, with Bitcoin alone

accounting for $175 billion a day.

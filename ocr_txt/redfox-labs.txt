BUILDING THE DIGITAL ECONOMY

Blackpaper v2.0
October 2020

ABSTRACT

RedFOX Labs is an emerging tech venture builder based in Southeast Asia, that
identifies and replicates successful pure-play business models for the local markets.
RedFOX Labs works to build, launch, and scale high growth ventures in Southeast
Asia. Its focus is to unlock the true market potential of the digital economy for high
consumer demand services such as e-commerce, e-media (includes
esports/gaming), e-travel, and ride-hailing/logistics.

RedFOxX Labs is incorporated as a joint-stock company in Vietnam which makes it
eligible to apply for government tenders and contracts and provide blockchain
solutions to government entities and corporations in Vietnam.

RedFOX Labs deploys a DBOT (Design, Build, Operate, and Transfer) model using
emerging technologies with a particular focus on esports, Blockchain, Al, AR/VR and
Cloud Computing.

Using a proprietary 9-point funnel system developed in-house, we process business
ideas and concepts in a structured way that focuses heavily on data and removes
any individual bias.

In order to be competitive in our selected verticals, we require largely language
agnostic, interoperable solutions that can scale rapidly without issues of congestion
or security. The platforms we build on allow us to be competitive in a market that
currently caters to less than 50% of its population and has 104 million residents in the
25 and 34 age range, which make up the majority of our core audience.

RedFOxX Labs is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, a Joint Stock Company in

Vietnam, and will have multiple companies in Singapore to ensure a presence in the
region's business capital.

RedFOX Labs was founded in July of 2018 with the intent to be Southeast Asia's first
blockchain venture builder and to help with the mass adoption of blockchain and
other emerging technologies.

Previously holding the position of GM of Komodo between 2017-18, Ben Fairbank and
co-founder Glen Pearce, identified that the gap between the core protocol layer of
blockchain technology and the ability for the end consumer to interact, meant mass
adoption was still some time away, yet the solutions it presented were too good not
to capitalise on.

Having been C-Level executives for companies such as Virgin Mobile, ChinaHR and
Grab, means the team is well versed in running successful companies in the region
and almost 2 decades of experience with multi-nationals such as Viva and Cell-C
through Silah Gulf and Ooredoo. The team is also well versed in start-ups, recently
aiding the Ooredoo Myanmar start-up and working for Southeast Asia’s largest
unicorn, Grab.

Through an advanced ecosystem of internet companies for the digital economy,
RedFOX Labs will take steps to become a super dApp in Southeast Asia.

More than 50% of the population in Southeast Asia don’t have access to the internet
economy. Many of the problems restricting access relate to not having bank
accounts, credit cards, high transaction fees, or are simply the result of a lack of trust
in digital payment options required for services such as Netflix.

Many companies struggle to scale sustainably in these markets and fail to capitalise
on the wider audience. These companies concentrate on the larger cities where
people are likely to be more connected to the internet economy and the subsequent
digital payment systems.

The concentration of competition in major cities and the lack of engagement in the
internet economy leaves multiple untapped opportunities across the region.

(i REDFOX LABS

SOLUTION

Identify Model Rapid Growth

We take proven, successful, unicorn companies and replicate them for emerging
markets. We utilise blockchain technology, Al, AR/VR and cloud computing to
leverage solutions to the existing problems businesses face in the region.

With the use of these platforms, we're able to unlock a percentage of the market
that remains under-served.

After designing and building the MVP for each project, we assess product-market fit
and hire an expert team accordingly. This team is entrusted to take the project to
the next level of growth and scaling. We use a core team at RedFOX Labs to design
and implement each company and then provide ongoing assistance through
networking, advisory services, and by retaining board seats.

Our focus is on digital inclusion and working toward a state where the end-users are
completely unaware they are interacting with blockchain and the other emerging
technologies we implement.

With E-Commerce doubling up year on year, REdFOX Labs has the opportunity to
compete against local giants such as Lazada, Shopee, and Zilingo in this rapidly
growing industry sector. Through the use of blockchain technology, RedFOX Labs
can process faster and cheaper transactions, provide easier entry to the market for
the under-served, and scale faster without the limitations of being bound by physical
borders.

RedFOX Labs will ascertain the business models with the least market saturation
and lowest barriers to entry and look to apply blockchain technology as its key point
of differentiation. With many existing models reliant heavily upon banking and
credit card solutions, RedFOX Labs can leverage alternate technology to take these
services to the far-reaching areas of both Vietnam and the greater Southeast Asian
region.

RedFOxX labs have countless opportunities in online media. RedFOX Labs already
lends itself favorably to both gaming and streaming with the ability to leverage both
of these verticals to grow rapidly in this emerging space.

RedFOX Labs will soon launch its streaming and cashback application which will
offer a variety of services and products within the Online Media sector to cater to
ever-growing consumer demand. An increasingly lower cost of internet services
coupled with increased options in online content has led to huge growth and heavy
foreign investment in the sector. With anticipated growth to nearly triple over the
next 5 years, there is plenty of room for RedFOX Labs to stamp its authority on this
sector within the region.

The Online Travel vertical provides many opportunities to RedFOX Labs in both
Vietnam and the region overall. In Vietnam 80% of the industry is dominated by
foreign players such as Expedia. This is set to change as many of the local players
transition away from traditional brick and mortar, to more heavily favored online
models.

The next 5 years are set to bring about more than 250% growth and are ripe for a
locally based player to offer tailored solutions to a local population that is spending
more of their disposable income on travel both domestically and also internationally.

The region also provides a window of opportunity to appeal to and capture the more
rural regions of Southeast Asia through creative blockchain solutions that will unlock
a percentage of the dormant internet economy.

Although Ride-Hailing is a focus vertical for RedFOX Labs, it will not focus or intend
to compete against local giants like Grab and Go Jek for ride-hailing. The industry
itself requires a monopoly to be profitable and therefore the focus will be more on

delivery and logistics which are a problem waiting to be solved in the majority of the

Southeast Asian countries.

With increasing traffic congestion and longer travel times, food and convenience

goods delivery services have boomed regionally. Demand outweighs the supply and
therefore multiple transport and delivery companies have emerged. None are more
prominent than Grab who is now also venturing into payments and other sectors as

it aims to become Asia’s next Super App.

(i REDFOX LABS

RedFOX Labs ECOSYSTEM

CONCEPT TO DESIGN

The 4 industry sectors or verticals that we focus on are largely focused on the
internet economy and include E-commerce, online travel, online media (including
gaming and esports), and ride-hailing.

RedFOX Labs employs a proprietary 9-step funnel process to determine which
business models to replicate. The ‘RFOX Funnel’ process determines competition,
market size, feasibility, market growth potential and determines if there is an actual
advantage in using blockchain technology, Al, AR/VR or cloud computing.

This model removes all emotion from the decision-making process and relies on
hard data collected during the ‘market research’ stage. By using the ‘RFOX Funnel’
we greatly reduce the risk of replicating a business that is not successful.

Once the business model to be replicated is chosen we work toward the release of
our MVP and on the GTM (Go To Market). This includes hiring an expert local team,
incorporation, legal structure, product development, testing, marketing, and
defining target audience parameters. During this period the RedFOX Labs team will
be on the ground and part of the build-out and execution.

For the MVP release, the RedFOX Labs team will stay with the team and do
post-launch reviews, product improvement, customer experience, and touch-point
mapping, market analysis, design a revised 2-3 year business plan, and help the
company to raise capital and expand and scale.

At this point, the RedFOX Labs team will provide support and advisory functions
from HQ and begin the planning of the next business. RedFOX Labs will remain
majority equity holders in the businesses we build and occupy seats on the company
board of directors.

(Vi REDE 0 LABS

TEAM STRUCTURE

The RedFOX Labs team will remain lean and agile. Our main competitive advantage
is that we have an ecosystem of service providers, vendors, and third-party providers,
meaning we can scale up and down with ease and are not hampered by an
extended capital expenditure burden.

RedFOX Labs’ team will act as the strategists, designers, and implement the GTM
and business plans. RedFOX Labs will have agreements in place to work with several
professional service providers across multiple industries that can lend deeper
experience to each of the businesses we build.

As each business is likely to be different in its structure and design, we are better
suited to ‘on-call’ experts rather than trying to up-skill the existing team in industry
experience that may take years to develop.

The core team of RedFOX Labs will train and develop new members to understand
the DBOT (Design, Build, Operate, Transfer) model, which will allow us to set-up
more businesses in the second and third years.

The RedFOX Labs core team is experienced in running disruptive technology
businesses and startups in Southeast Asia and for multinational companies globally.
Our established network of contacts will allow us to grow and expand with expert
assistance and guidance.

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

Our ‘unfair’ advantage is the ability to leverage our own ecosystem. We are able to
provide each new business with advisory, legal structure and assistance, network
introductions, and expertise to ensure a greater chance of success. We work with
industry experts in each industry sector and ensure we don't have ‘bakers fixing cars’.

As a venture builder, RedFOX Labs is able to quickly deploy and scale businesses that
also compliment the greater ecosystem. For example, it is reasonable to assume if
we are hiring large numbers of staff in the Southeast Asian region, we would be able
to spin up a recruitment company. This would turn a cost line in our operation into a
profit centre by also providing these services to external parties.

RFOX GAMES

RFOX Games is the official venture responsible for KOGs and other games being
built out within the RFOX ecosystem and will be the official gaming division of
RedFOX Labs. RFOX Games will have its own blackpaper and channels. The central
RFOX token will be used across all games and platforms.

RFOX Games will be registered in Singapore and service the Southeast Asian region
and act as an HQ for all international business operations related to the gaming
division.

KOGs

The first release under the RFOX Games banner is a gaming platform and ecosystem
powered by NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) called KOGs, or Keys to Other Games. These
are interoperable collectible game pieces that can be used between multiple games
to unlock levels, weapons, and skins, to provide early and hidden access in games,
and also act as keys to tournament entry.

E-commerce streaming has become one of the fastest-growing industries in China
with revenues projected to hit 134 Billion USD by the end of 2020 in China alone. This
industry sector is in its early stages in Southeast Asia with leading e-commerce and
retailers such as Lazada and Shopee now starting to realise the potential and offer
their own e-streaming services.

RedFOX Labs will launch a new venture that combines e-commerce streaming with
affiliate cashback, giving customers an average of 8% back on purchases. This app is
in the final stages of development and RedFOX Labs is already an affiliate of Lazada
which is the leading e-commerce platform in the region. RedFOX Labs will first
target the high growth markets of Vietnam and the Philippines before looking to
expand across the Southeast Asian region.

VIRTUAL SPACE

RedFOX Labs will soon begin deployment of a virtual space focusing on
Gaming/Esports, Art, and Music. NFTs will feature heavily in this virtual space
including the ownership of the space itself, which will also be in the form of an NFT.
Owners will receive payments from sales generated/rent within the venue. Artists,
gamers and musicians can showcase their talents, perform events, compete and
conduct sales of their products.

RedFOX Labs will partner with high-profile companies to deliver and develop this
business and it will play an important role within the greater ecosystem. RFOX will
remain the main ‘underlying’ currency for the entire ecosystem and payments and
payment gateways will be provided by our network partners (to be announced).

DECENTRALAND HQ IN CRYPTO VALLEY

As part of our commitment to Virtual Space, we will launch a virtual replica of our
Vietnam RedFOX Labs HQ in Crypto Valley. This will provide an opportunity for
people to ‘virtually visit’ our offices and will act as a learning lab for all things RFOX.
From this venue, we will also host hackathons in conjunction with Coinsilium,
Decentraland, and other network partners.

Decentraland is the first decentralised world controlled by a DAO (decentralised
autonomous organization), that allows its users, who are the owners, to decide their
own future.

RSK - IOV LABS ASIA

RedFOX Labs has signed an agreement with a JV between stock listed Coinsilium
and IOV Labs named IOV Labs ASIA, to develop a number of products and services
for distribution across the Southeast Asian region. In addition, RedFOX Labs will
utilise the products, services, and bridges created within the RSK ecosystem as well
as leverage its solid stablecoin products to provide decentralised payment options
across the RFOX ecosystem.

RFOX will begin as an ERC20 Token and from there make use of bridges to other
chains such as RSK, WAX, VERUS, and KMD. RFOX will leverage its industry partners
RSK and IOV Labs Asia to offer stablecoins throughout the RFOX ecosystem. RedFOX
Labs will work with multiple chains to create NFTs and financial products and
services that all require the reduction of RFOX token supply in order to be generated.
The RFOX token will power the entire RFOX ecosystem and act as a form of
payment. It will be used for trading fees, to develop liquidity pools, and for the
creation of NFTs.

RFOX GAMES

RFOX will be the main form of payment for KOGs collector packs, trading fees,
merchandise, and act as rewards for set holders and tournament participants. RFOX
Games will publish its own blackpaper and tokenomics model prior to its game
launch on WAX.

VIRTUAL SPACE

RFOX will be the main token powering the economy within the virtual space,
however, we will work with our partners to ensure we have FIAT on-ramps and
accept most major currencies. Fees, rent, commissions will all course through RFOX
on the second layer.

ECOSYSTEM TOKEN

As RedFOX Labs may build companies and products on multiple chains, the RFOX
token will assume the role of being the main currency for all of these projects. The
RFOX token may take the form of either wrapped RFOX or a version of RFOX on that
particular chain. The generation of new tokens for each project will be extracted
from the main RFOX supply.

STABLECOIN AND CURRENCY GENERATION

As some markets and economies will require the use of a non-volatile currency,
RFOX may choose to create stablecoins or currencies that are backed by RFOX
tokens. These tokens will be taken out of circulating supply and give the stablecoins
backing.

THE TOKEN ALLOCATION

CIRCULATING SUPPLY

A private and public sale was conducted in April of 2019, issuing 130 Million RFOX
coins. As some vesting periods already matured, the carried forward circulating
supply will be approx 135 million x 10 after the swap (67.5%).

TEAM AND RFOX ADVISORS

The team will reduce its holding prior to the swap from 100 million to 25 million, a
75% reduction, and relock the tokens as a sign of commitment and faith in the
quality of work we aim to provide in the coming 24 months.

These tokens will be released over 3 periods, starting at 1 year and ending at 24
months. The allocation which was previously 20% and has largely vested, will be
reduced to 12.5% and released at intervals of 25% at 1 year, 25% at 18 months, and 50%
at 2 years. This will mean the team and advisors allocation will now be 25 million x 10
after the swap (12.5%).

ECOSYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND TREASURY

A total of 35 million RFOX x 10 after the swap (17.5%) will be set aside for development
and treasury which will enable RFOX to develop tools and products faster and with
increased efficiency. These funds will be released in monthly increments over 50
months.

RFOX & KOGS HOLDERS

RFOX holders will receive x 10 their current holdings in the new ERC20 Token.

KOGs Holders will receive an allocation of RFOX which will be highlighted in the
litepaper and subsequent releases.

RFOX RISKS

By purchasing, owning, and using RFOX, you expressly acknowledge and assume the following risks:
Risk of Losing Access to RFOX Due to Loss of Private Key(s), Custodial Error or Purchaser Error

A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to control and dispose of RFOX stored in
your digital wallet or vault. Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with your digital wallet
or vault storing RFOX will result in loss of such RFOX. Moreover, any third party that gains access to
such private key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet service you use,
may be able to misappropriate you RFOX. Any errors or malfunctions caused by or otherwise related to
the digital wallet or vault you choose to receive and store RFOX in, including your own failure to
properly maintain or use such digital wallet or vault, may also result in the loss of your RFOX.
Additionally, your failure to follow precisely the procedures set forth in for buying and receiving Coins,
including, for instance, if you provide the wrong address for the receiving RFOX, or provides an address
that is not Komodo compatible, may result in the loss of your coins.

Risks Associated with used blockchain Protocol

Because RFOX is currently based on the Komodo protocol, any malfunction, breakdown or
abandonment of the Komodo protocol may have a material adverse effect on the platform or RFOX.
Moreover, advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum
computing, could present risks to the RFOX and the platform, including the utility of RFOX for
obtaining services, by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins
the Komodo protocol. This applies to any future technology platform that RFOX decides to use in its
sole discretion.

Risk of Hacking and Security Weaknesses

Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the platform or RFOX
in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks,
consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing, and spoofing. Furthermore, because the platform is
based on open-source software, there is a risk that a third party or a member of the Company team
may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure of the platform,
which could negatively affect the platform and the utility of RFOX for obtaining services.

Risks Associated with Markets for RFOX

If secondary trading of Tokens is facilitated by third-party exchanges, such exchanges may be relatively
new and subject to little or no regulatory oversight, making them more susceptible to fraud or

manipulation. Furthermore, to the extent that third-parties do ascribe an external exchange value to
RFOX (e.g., as denominated in a digital or fiat currency), such value may be extremely volatile.

Risk of Uninsured Losses

Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions, RFOX are uninsured unless you
specifically obtain private insurance to insure them. Thus, in the event of loss or loss of utility value,
there is no public insurer or private insurance arranged by Company, to offer recourse to you.

Risks Associated with Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions

The regulatory status of RFOX and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many
jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation
with respect to such technology and its applications, including the RFOX ecosystem and RFOx. It is
likewise difficult to predict how or whether legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes
to law and regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including the
ecosystem and RFOX. Regulatory actions could negatively impact the platform and RFOX in various
ways, including, for purposes of illustration only, through a determination that the purchase, sale and
delivery of RFOX constitutes unlawful activity or that RFOX are a regulated instrument that require
registration or licensing of those instruments or some or all of the parties involved in the purchase, sale
and delivery thereof. The Company may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory
actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially
undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.

Risks Arising from Taxation

The tax characterization of RFOX is uncertain. You must seek your own tax advice in connection with
purchasing RFOX, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you, including withholding taxes,
income taxes and tax reporting requirements.

Risk of Competing platforms

It is possible that alternative platforms could be established that utilize the same opensource code and
protocol underlying the platform and attempt to facilitate services that are materially similar to the
RFOX services.

Risks Arising from Lack of Governance Rights

Because RFOX confer no governance rights of any kind with respect to the RFOX coin or the Company,
all decisions involving the Company's products or services within the ecosystem or the Company itself
will be made by the Company at its sole discretion. These decisions could adversely affect the
ecosystem and the utility of any RFOX you own, including their utility for obtaining services.

Middleman is humanity’s main burden. Without
middlemen, the efficiency of all social interac-
tions would increase several-fold. And, as a con-
sequence, the purchasing power of consumers’
money would increase, too. This could only be a
dream before. Today modern technologies allow
us to make it a reality.

The way goods and services are distributed to-
day is archaic and inefficient. Within this discrim-
inatory system, suppliers are forced to sell their
goods and services for unjustly low prices, while
end-consumers have to buy those same goods
and services for too much. This triggers a system-
ic degradation of the quality of goods and services,
unjustified increase of advertising and marketing
costs in the end price of a product, hugely dispro-
portional share of profits being seized by middle-
men, and a marked decrease of real purchasing
power of consumers’ money.

1See the AgeHack section for more details.

However, technological innovations in computing,
logistics and banking give birth to a combined
disruptive technology that may completely change
the model of interaction between supplier and
consumer by removing most of the redundant in-
termediary elements. Cryptaur unites these tech-
nological innovations and further enhances them
with a number of its own proprietary solutions
in the field of social capital management and user
rights protection.

Cryptaur is to increase the efficacy of all social
interactions by freeing them from all kinds of
middlemen and by making those interactions im-
mediate, transparent, secure and mutually benefi-
cial. This goal will be achieved by creating a fast
blockchain-based decentralized value exchange
ecosystem and organizing user interactions on
the peer-to-peer basis. The Cryptaur ecosystem
will be used by mass users — both suppliers and
consumers — from all around the world.

Cryptaur is unique and different from other block-
chain-based projects by being not a single dApp
service, but rather a framework to host multiple
dApps governed by the same rules and powered by
the same currency. Cryptaur users will gain access
to potentially unlimited number of specialized P2P
services (dApps) and enjoy the economy of scale
advantages stemming from the growing number
of users and services. Specific unique features of
the Cryptaur ecosystem include:

— the universal
on-platform payment and reward unit. Unlike fiat
money and most crypto currencies, the Cryptaur
token will have an intrinsic value based on (1) ac-
tual purchasing power surplus and (2) tokeniza-
tion of the user active lifespan extension.

— multi-functional payment
platform designed for seamless transactions in-
volving fiat money, conditional currency units (cur-
rency baskets), and crypto currencies in a risk-free
environment.

— proprietary social relations manage-
ment engine to direct and reward users’ behaviors

Problem of the Present-Day Economy

Existing system of distribution of goods and ser-
vices is full of critical flaws that make this system
archaic, vulnerable and inefficient. Most impor-
tantly, it is highly monopolized by large players,
which results in economic dictatorship from the
wholesale and retail networks whereby suppliers
are forced to sell their products at minimum bulk
prices and end consumers have to purchase those
very products at unjustifiably high retail prices.

Producer is thus deprived of the opportunity to in-
vest sufficient funds into R&D and produce prod-
ucts of decent quality. The rules of the game on
the modern market push the producer to cut costs
and imitate quality while neglecting the actual
consumer properties of a product. As a direct con-
sequence, consumer has to buy low-quality and
often unsafe products that at the same time are
ridiculously overpriced.

Producer and consumer being separated from
each other by a chain of intermediaries makes the

relations between the main agents of economic
activity woefully depersonalized. This paves the
way for consumers to be cheated, often by for-
mally legal means. For example, product labeling
regulations leave little chance for the consumer to
know the real ingredient composition of food and
beverages, let alone the origin and quality of the
raw materials used.

Another factor that undermines the efficacy of the
existing system is the huge share of marketing
and advertising costs in the final price of a prod-
uct. All these costs are transferred onto the end
consumer, although the contents of marketing
communications over the last decades have been
less and less related to a product's actual prop-
erties. Instead, marketing has been turning into a
tool used to manipulate perceptions of the target
audiences. This trend towards mind manipulation
has become particularly pronounced with the ar-
rival of online marketing involving the so called
Big Data and heralding the arrival of what could be
thought of as post-human capitalism and consumer
neo-behaviorism.

New Possibilities

At the same time, revolutionary innovations of the
past decades have brought about a number of cru-
cial pre-requisites for the outdated and inefficient
economic model of supplier/consumer interaction
to finally be replaced by fundamentally different
models. Such pre-requisites include the following
components:

1. Virtualization of data carriers allowing almost
all information content (books, music, photo, vid-
eo, magazines, newspapers, textbooks, dictionar-
ies, etc.) to be distributed and consumed without
physical media.

2. Onlinization of communications between people
that removes existing geographical barriers and
makes any information readily accessible to any-
one in real time. This trend is bound to continue as
the last language-related barriers will be eventual-
ly swept away by the new translator applications.

3. Improvement of logistics systems, including new
powerful tools to manage big amounts of data to
optimize costs and times of product delivery, as

well as the introduction of totally new delivery
vehicles such as flying drones and self-driving
trucks.

4. Development of distributed decentralized com-
munication networks that allow economic agents
to interact directly or organize into self-managing
autonomous producer/consumer communities.

5. Arrival and spread of new payment methods —
from the already widely accepted online banking
services and PayPal-like payment platforms all
the way to the relatively new but already well es-
tablished crypto currencies that offer so many rev-
olutionary benefits to their users.

All these pre-requisites organically merge togeth-
er to give birth to a new complex disruptive tech-
nology that makes it possible to totally re-format
existing relationships between subjects of all eco-
nomic or — in a wider sense — all social interac-
tions. The efficiency of such interactions can be
radically increased by the removal of all or nearly
all redundant links of both technical and human
nature.

In a nutshell, Cryptaur is a gateway to an alterna-
tive global economy where users — suppliers and
consumers — interact directly. The decentralized
blockchain-based Cryptaur ecosystem will provide
appropriate means and establish relevant rules for
its participants to mutually reap the benefits of im-
mediate and instant value exchange deals, such
as sale of goods and services.

Users that join the Cryptaur ecosystem as con-
sumers will gain access to a potentially unlimit-
ed number of products offered via Cryptaur’s own
and third-party specialized decentralized applica-
tions (dApps) hosted and governed by the same
principles across the whole ecosystem.

Suppliers who meet the criteria of the Cryptaur
ecosystem will gain access to a powerful consum-
er base to offer their products at very competitive
prices that will still leave room for a reasonable
markup. All proceeds from a sale will go straight
to the supplier.

By employing the blockchain technology, Cryptaur
allows for purchasing decisions to be based on
fully transparent information. Cryptaur connects
providers and consumers in an environment where
goods and services are vetted by the community
consensus and their real value as opposed to the
now prevalent model whereby large players with
monetary means maximize product exposure to
consumers so that sales are predicated on expo-
sure rather than on actual product properties.

Synergetically interested in each other, suppliers
and consumers at Cryptaur will grow in numbers
in an organic way, which will be further facilitated
by the underlying mechanisms that manage social
relationships and behaviors within the ecosystem
in accordance with models and patterns reliably
established by social sciences.

Peer-to-peer

The peer-to-peer principle of interaction is by far
THE most important element of decentralization.
And so it is for Cryptaur. There are many popular
services out there like Uber or Airbnb that bring
suppliers and consumers together but ultimate-
ly remain to be the central authority with vested
interests — those of a profit taker with insatia-
ble appetite. In such services, consumers do get
certain price benefits, but suppliers are often the
ones who are materially disadvantaged. Thus, the
service owner remains in the position of a middle-
man and retains a considerable part of the value
exchanged by the interacting parties.

In Cryptaur, value exchange occurs without any
middleman involved. The product is delivered to
the end consumer and the supplier gets the pay-
ment without deductions. Only payment process-
ing fees are there, but these are negligible thanks
to the payment methods used. With this peer-
to-peer model in place, Cryptaur intends to offer
a wide range of sharing economy type services

similar to the one mentioned above but at much,
much more competitive prices. It is estimated that
Cryptaur’s economic model will allow to keep price
levels on average up to 50% lower than those of-
fered by competitors for comparable products.

This way, consumers will be empowered to buy
better products for less money, while suppliers
will earn more and be able to re-invest more into
making better products. The vicious circle of glob-
al product quality degradation will be broken at
last and an opposite process of product quality
improvement without price increases will be initi-
ated.

Interacting peer-to-peer style, both suppliers and
consumers will find themselves in an environment
naturally fostering more ethical behaviors of all
the parties involved. Cryptaur will put econom-
ic actors into close proximity thus bringing the
personal aspect back into the game. As a result,
parties to a deal will be organically inclined to act
more responsibly and respectably.

Blockchain

The next core element of the Cryptaur ecosystem
is blockchain. This groundbreaking technology
will be used by Cryptaur for purposes extending
far beyond the obvious applications related to just
crypto payments.

As it could be expected, Ethereum-based block-
chain in Cryptaur will be used to transparently
and verifiably keep record of the history of all pay-
ments between users. But much more than that, it
will store a “digital print” of each transaction with
detailed data confirmed by independent arbitra-
tion reports:

end-to-end certification;

detailed product/service properties;
product/service price structure;
product/service user rating;

reputational profiles of the interacting parties;
proof of delivery.

In order to be admitted to sell their goods and
services via a Cryptaur-based dApp, suppliers will
have to provide detailed information about what
they are offering and get a positive arbitration re-
port. This is done to ensure the most fundamental
right of the consumer — to know exactly what they
are buying and to judge for themselves if a certain
product is really worth their money. Products and

services that may have a significant impact on
consumers’ health and quality of life, such as food-
stuffs or food supplements, kids’ toys and clothes,
will be subjected to stricter scrutiny. In case of a
service, e.g. house-cleaning or personal coaching,
the person offering the service will be treated like
a “product” and scrutinized for their qualifications,
experience and reputation.

Suppliers will also be expected to disclose the
price structure of their products, including their
R&D investments, direct production costs, expens-
es for logistics, depreciation charges, taxes, and
the markup they earn. This will establish a new
gold standard of fair trade and enable consumers
to make informed and intelligent purchasing de-
cisions.

Importantly to Cryptaur, the “motive power” that
makes goods and services flow within dApps and
across the ecosystem as a whole is not adver-
tising and marketing, but the user community it-
self — consumers will curate products by sharing
their verified reviews and giving their recommen-
dations. These “acts of curation” become part of
a product's history and are stored on blockchain
for verification. Equally important, though, is that
the “curators” themselves are checked for being
honest. That is why users’ reputational profiles are
also put on blockchain.

Finally, blockchain in Cryptaur is used to trace the
whole delivery path of a product or a service to
make sure the deal was effected as agreed by its
parties. Only objective “transaction-critical path
markers” are monitored by relevant smart con-
tracts, such as the date an order was placed in the
system, amount and timestamp of the payment,
place and time of delivery. The system will rely on
the data generated internally and — whenever tech-
nically possible — on data of objective monitoring
received from external sources, such as GPS posi-
tioning devices or web-based public records.

Cryptaur Utility Token

The lifeblood of the entire Cryptaur ecosystem and
all of its dApps is the Cryptaur Utility Token (CPT).
The token is based on the Ethereum platform and
is ERC20-compliant.

The primary function of the Cryptaur token is to
serve as the native currency unit within the eco-
system to pay for goods and services. However,
users will be able to feely choose the method of
payment that they prefer as buyers or sellers, in-
cluding fiat money (credit and debit cards, bank
transfers), conditional currency units (currency
baskets), Cryptaur tokens, as well as cryptocurren-
cies and their derivative trade pairs that are freely
traded at exchange platforms.

Another function of the Cryptaur token is to re-
ward its users for different desired behaviors.
The simplest of such behaviors is making a pur-
chase which will result in a cashback to the buyer.
In Cryptaur, this type of rewards is referred to as
crypto-paybacks. If a user does something useful
to the Cryptaur community as a whole, they are en-
titled to incentives of another type known as shar-
ing-graces. A verified honest product review or a
recommendation that led to a further product sale
are examples of what sharing-graces are earned
for. The third type of reward is paid to users for
creating and managing consumer groups within
Cryptaur. These rewards are collectively referred
to as team-bounces.

In addition to the functions that the Cryptaur to-
ken performs within the ecosystem, it will also be
listed on several crypto-exchanges, allowing users
and general public to buy and sell it either for oth-
er cryptocurrencies or for fiat money.

The process of decentralized governance in Crypt-
aur will be effected in accordance with the ecosys-
tem’s Constitution by a meritocratically appointed
governing body — Supreme Arbitration Council.

Cryptaur Pay Platform

A key idea of Cryptaur is to bring the benefits of
decentralization that are currently the domain of
a relatively narrow community of crypto-enthusi-
asts, to the general public. To achieve this Crypt-
aur creates a payment gateway to process pay-
ments that may entail fiat-to-crypto, crypto-to-fiat,
fiat-to-fiat and crypto-to-crypto conversions in an
as seamless and user-friendly way as possible. All
users, consumers and suppliers alike, will be free
to choose the payment option of their preference
without the need to delve into the “rocket science”
of crypto-currencies and crypto-exchanges.

On top of that, our goal is to make sure our users
do not have to pay high transaction and conver-
sion fees invariably incurred by all those who con-
vert their fiat money into crypto-currency and vice
versa through existing exchange platforms. Our
plan is to enter into tight partnerships with exist-
ing financial institutions as well as to create ele-
ments of Cryptaur’s own “banking system” to keep
transaction costs at bay and offer better terms to
its users.

Cryptaur Pay will also have a number of specific
features whose purpose is to make users’ pay-
ment experience not just convenient, but safe as
well. Existing trends suggest that in the years to
come huge numbers of mainstream consumers

will start using crypto currencies. By inference,
the number of those abusing this payment instru-
ment, i.e. using it for improper purposes, will rise
too. This means that honest and law-abiding users
will want to be sure they are get paid by someone
who can be trusted, that they send their money to
someone who is trustworthy, and that the money
being sent is itself free from “bad” history. With
this in mind, Cryptaur Pay will develop and imple-
ment a proprietary Know Your Risks (KYR) engine
to check each transaction for potential risks to
keep a user away from doubtful payment opera-
tions.

Social Capital Management System

Explosion of e-commerce and social media has
dramatically transformed the way people inter-
act with technology. However, no platform has yet
managed to successfully combine the power of
social media with commerce in a genuinely fric-
tionless environment.

Social media platforms are flooded with ads, and
e-commerce sites are full of reviews that do not
represent the potential buyer’s true sources of
influence. This system is fraught with problems.
Marketing companies are ineffective curators of
products for they are motivated by profit only, and
current review systems suffer from multifaceted
biases that encourage inflated ratings.

Cryptaur introduces its Social Capital Management
System that is the basis for anew commercial mod-
el where promotion of a product is tied to users’
own experience and the influence that they have
within their own social environment. Cryptaur’s
review system eliminates biases that are known
to skew results, whereas Cryptaur’s proprietary
Contribution Engine rewards the influence of users
who grow and maintain the networks of their own.

Marketers and advertisers heavily rely on their
power to influence perceived value of their prod-
ucts and services to convince consumers to buy.
Consumers use available information to assess
the cost/benefit ratio of an action, and since this
information is often paid for by providers, consum-
ers tend to end up taking decisions that are not in
their own true interests.

Generally, product reviews are losing the trust of
consumers for two main reasons: for being faked
and for being biased. Fake reviews are paid for
by suppliers to promote products essentially the
same way traditional advertising does, but in a
disguised form. Real reviews are mostly biased
towards the more positive end of the scale. The
latter phenomenon could be explained by two fac-
tors: reciprocity and proximity.

Sharing economy and peer-to-peer platforms in-
volve a two-way rating. A consumer providing an

honest bad rating subjects their own rating to the
risk of being damaged by the provider's return bad
rating as a form of retaliation. That is how reci-
procity leads to inflated ratings. Also, in sharing
economy suppliers and consumers are brought
to interact face-to-face. And as human beings are
naturally inclined to seek social acceptance, it is
tempting to leave an inflated positive review to
someone we directly interact with. This is the ef-
fect of proximity.

Therefore, the best thing consumers can do is
turn to their own “native” social circles to seek
truly reliable information, recommendations, and
validations for their purchasing decisions. 83% of
consumers trust the recommendations made by
their friends and family and take action on these
recommendations, making the good old word-of-
mouth still the most trusted and effective market-
ing tool.

Cryptaur provides consumers with information
that can be trusted because it comes either from
a verified independent source (another user or an
expert) or from a member of consumer's own so-
cial circle (relative, friend, etc). All these agents
play pre-defined social roles that are scientifically
managed to the benefit of both — a particular user
and the community as a whole. A behavior that
the system prescribes and welcomes as desirable
is a contribution.

Complete record of a user’s behaviors creates their
dynamic reputational scores. These scores have
immediate monetary equivalents and, as such,
represent that user's social capital. Combined so-
cial capital of all users may be thought of as our
ecosystem’s overall “added value” whose organic
growth is the ultimate goal of the Social Capital
Management System.

Social Roles and Ways to Contribute

Cryptaur rewards measurable contributions. The
following types of contributions are recognized by
the Cryptaur ecosystem:

Purchase: Any expenditure of a buyer, whether in
fiat or in crypto currency, is a contribution which is
rewarded in Cryptaur tokens.

Invite: To encourage Cryptaur users to refer
friends, they are rewarded Cryptaur tokens based
on the future sales and purchases of the individu-
als they invited to the Cryptaur community.

Promote: Users — simple buyers and experts
alike — may contribute to a purchase by referring
a product or service to others within the Cryptaur
ecosystem or through other social channels.

Influence: Upon delivery of a product, a buyer has
the ability to share a positive or negative review to

enable others to make better purchasing decisions.

Connect: Through their social connections, indi-
viduals may link potential buyers with reviews
from previous buyers, acting as a trusted informa-
tion channel.

To reiterate, the goal of the system is to encourage
and reward users for being trusted and useful in-
fluencers in the brand new economic environment
that Cryptaur seeks to create.

SCMS Checks and Balances

Any economic incentive is exposed to the risk of
being manipulated by individuals or groups in order
to profit unfairly. It could seem tempting to leave
only positive reviews or even promote products of
poor quality in order to earn more rewards. With-
in the Cryptaur ecosystem, it is more profitable
to behave honestly than to act trickily. To ensure
this we create a scoring system that reflects the
degree of trust earned by users and impacts the
reward allocation between the contributors. The
combined score is based on four behavior-driven
indexes:

Trust: Transparency and honesty of users in their
product recommendations inferred from the cor-
relation between a user's reviews and the reviews
left by subsequent buyers.

Activity: It is assumed that active Cryptaur users
are more likely to be trustworthy.

Promotion Performance: High promotion perfor-
mance shows that a user's influence is targeted
at the right recipients, while promoting a product
to the wrong audience will not generate further re-
ferrals.

Staking: Higher wallet balances are interpreted as
higher levels of a user's commitment to the plat-
form. Users who are committed to the long-term
success and growth of Cryptaur are less likely to
abuse its rules.

The Win/Win/Win Benefit Model

Cryptaur suppliers benefit from a new direct sales
channel where the Cryptaur ecosystem is not an
intermediary but is rather the conductive media for
the buyer and the seller. Suppliers can get imme-
diate access to large numbers of potential buyers
with virtually zero customer acquisition costs. The
Cryptaur ecosystem relies on consumers, and not
marketing dollars, to promote products. Suppliers
can reward promoters with fiat currency rewards,
or simply rely on the system’s native Social Capital
Management System that distributes rewards to
incentivize their consumers and promoters.

Cryptaur consumers are offered an ad-free envi-
ronment where the only source of influence is re-
views from trusted users and blockchain-based
verifiable data on a product's properties and sales
performance. Furthermore, active consumers are
predictably and fairly rewarded for a known set of
behaviors that benefit others. A career promoter
can earn substantial revenues by building a cus-
tomer base and by identifying other promoters in
their network that will support the sale of a prod-
uct. This means that direct sales efforts, as well
as team building efforts, are equally important.

Both suppliers and consumers may freely pursue
their personal goals within the rules of the game
accepted across all dApps on the Cryptaur eco-
system. At the same time, the ecosystem itself
benefits from the behavior of its users by organ-
ically expanding the range of the goods and ser-
vices offered as well the number of users involved.
This growth, in its turn, brings further benefits to
the users who may enjoy the economy of scale ad-
vantages that entail lower prices and better quali-
ty of goods and services, as well lower transaction
costs.

User Rights Protection System

User Rights Protection System will be built into the
core platform and will embrace all dApps residing
in the Cryptaur ecosystem. The goal of URPS is to
ensure suppliers and consumers are equally pro-
tected whenever a party is mistreated by another

party.

At the “port of entry”, suppliers are understand-
ably expected to pass through a somewhat more
stringent compliance procedure because, by de-
fault, the damage that they may cause is poten-
tially greater than that normally associated with a
single consumer. In practical terms it means that
a new consumer will be required to identify just
themselves, whereas a supplier will be required to
identify themselves and their products.

In addition to that, suppliers will have to make se-
curity deposits to make sure reasonable funds are
always available to restore justice in case of a dis-
pute in which the supplier is found to be at fault.
The amount of the minimum security deposit is a

dynamic value predicated on the supplier’s reputa-
tion and the scale of their commercial operations.
All other things being equal, a supplier with a long
impeccable history will have to deposit less than
a newcomer.

If a faulty provider refuses to correct a mistake,
consumer guarantees will be funded from the
provider deposits. If a provider fails to deliver, the
URPS will work with the provider to ensure a sat-
isfactory product delivery or a full refund. Failure
to achieve satisfactory remediation will result in
the provider losing access to the user base in the
Cryptaur ecosystem.

In an opposite case, should a consumer take un-
due advantages of their privileges, they may be
removed from the Cryptaur ecosystem too. Also,
providers might refuse service to high risk disput-
ers or repeat offenders. However, it is our strong
belief that both suppliers and consumers will in
general be motivated to act in good faith because
of the tangible benefits of conducting commerce
on the platform.

Introduction to Cryptaur dApps

As stated elsewhere in this Smartbook, Cryptaur
is an ecosystem that is meant to host different
decentralized applications (dApps). These dApps
are the specialized “playing fields” where specific
types of goods and services are grouped around a
key business idea.

To get a better idea of the whole concept, you may
think of Cryptaur as a state, dApps — as its institu-
tions, and users — as its citizens. Cryptaur’s “con-
stitution” is a set of basic laws that are universal
across all dApps. However, within dApps there may
be subsets of specific rules relevant and meaning-
ful to those dApps only. And the Cryptaur token
can be understood as the “national currency”.
The comparison to the state has its known limits
though. Unlike a regular state, Cryptaur offers to
its “citizens” all the benefits of decentralization, of
which transparency and immutability are the fun-
damental ones. Equally important is that the “na-
tional currency” of Cryptaur known as CPT is pro-
tected from inflation by the very emission model.

The number of dApps that may exist within the
Cryptaur ecosystem is potentially unlimited. And
it is our goal to provide as much diversity as pos-
sible to our users. However, there are several uni-
fying principles each dApp must comply with:

A Special Note on Shared Economy

The world as we know it is moving at a rapid pace
from large centralized business models to more
distributed, decentralized and peer-to-peer mod-
els. These new models are more efficient, scale
better and provide more freedom. Uber/Lyft and
Airbnb are examples of most successful busi-
nesses built around distributed and voluntary
peer-to-peer participants. The sum total of these
businesses is commonly referred to as shared or
sharing economy. The shared economy has paved

ways for brand new business models and sources
of income.

From our perspective, it is in the realm of shared
economy that some of our most successful dApps
will appear to challenge the dominance of the
well-established yet “under-decentralized” giants
such as Booking or Airbnb. Complete removal of
the centralized authority as a profit center will
make our prices more competitive and enable us
to conquer a considerable share of the market.

However, although sharing economy does seem to
be exceptionally conductive to the business mod-
el developed by Cryptaur, it is not our intention or
principle to allow only sharing economy dApps
onto our platform. There are other equally attrac-
tive business applications that may successfully
develop within the Cryptaur ecosystem enabling
users to enjoy the benefits of decentralization.

Development of dApps
There are essentially two sources of dApps for the

Cryptaur ecosystem. The first one is Cryptaur's
own dApps to be developed by our team in-house.

Please see the relevant section below on the first
dApps to be launched on the Cryptaur platform as
well as the short-list of potential dApps to be de-
veloped in the future.

The second source of dApps is the “dApp Incubator”
that Cryptaur intends to create to support indepen-
dent developer teams that may apply to us with a
dApp proposal at essentially any stage of its ma-
turity — from just an idea all the way to a finished
product. Depending on particular circumstances,
Cryptaur may support further development of the
suggested dApp on agreed terms and conditions
or buy it out from the original developers.

The dApp Incubator will perform three main
functions: (1) funding development of promising
dApps; (2) providing platform for alpha and beta
testing of dApps; (3) providing consumer focus
groups for commercial testing of dApps.

Those interested in approaching Cryptaur with a
dApp initiative are welcome to do so at our site by
using the Partnership section. Please be advised
that the more specific you are about your proposal,
the higher the chances we will get in touch with you.

The First Cryptaur dApps

For many startups, ICO seems to be a most attrac-
tive option to raise funds. There is a general con-
sensus today that ICO is the new face of crowd-
funding. Indeed, attracting investments through
ICOs has plenty of advantages over the older ways
of funding projects. These advantages include re-
moval of all geographic borders for participation,
better transparency, and more accessible financial
instruments for participants to contribute.

GolCO

However, a typical successful ICO campaign may
have some drawbacks too, like being prohibitively
expensive to outsource or too complicated to han-
dle in-house. There are quite a lot of companies on

the market now that offer their ICO services, but
due to the present-day global crypto-hype such
companies tend to shamelessly charge astronom-
ical sums much in the same way legal firms are
notoriously known for. Others might attract naive
clients with affordable prices while lacking the re-
quired expertise in the field.

Cryptaur intends to launch a specialized dApp that
will turn the process of conducting an ICO from a
stressful and expensive puzzle to an affordable yet
effective DIY exercise. Instead of throwing about
hundreds of thousands of dollars or trying to get
to grips with all the complexities of the fast trans-
forming crypto-industry, we will offer our clients a
set of simple tools to set up their own ICO within
days, including a web site, a white paper, a custom
token and further elements of the infrastructure
that they may require to start.

ROADMAP

Our GoICO dApp will make an initial feasibility
study of an intended project by inviting a client to
fill out a questionnaire. Based on the results of this
audit, the system will suggest a number of pre-set
packages that, rooted in the industry’s best prac-
tices, should suit the client’s cause most. These
templates can then be further customized to make
sure each project is not “just another ICO” but
is rather an undertaking with clearly articulated
unique features and recognizable character.

Soon thereafter a new ICO will be ready to take off
without making a hole in the client's pocket. Then
the client will see in real time how well their ICO is
performing. As the ICO progresses, the client will
also be able to further tweak some of its parame-
ters, e.g. by adding new features from our toolbox or
dropping the ones that seem to be out of place. Con-
veniently, the client will be able to fund further stag-
es of the ICO from the funds raised at earlier stages.
With a team of accomplished professionals whose
expertise extends far beyond the world of crypto-
currencies, we are able to provide to our clients ex-
tensive marketing, operational, legal and, last but
not least, financial support and solutions.

Cryptoindustry is booming. A huge number of
crypto-novices have already developed genuine in-
terest towards participation in ICOs. Even greater
number of people are to join the army of the cryp-
to-enthusiasts in the months and years to come.
But despite bold announcements most ICOs make
to the effect that they will provide “seamless pay-
ment experience”, in most cases investors have to
convert their fiat money into crypto on their own
in order to participate, while the ICOs of their in-
terest ultimately fail to provide that “seamless ex-
perience” and continue to accept contributions in
cryptocurrencies only.

Cryptaur, and the GoICO dApp as a constituent
part thereof, is among the very few elite league
players on the market to offer truly convenient and
hassle-free options for ICO backers to contribute
in a simple and convenient way they are used to
— be it credit or debit cards, fiat bank transfers or
mainstream cryptocurrencies. Even now, at a rela-
tively early stage of GolCO development (as of No-
vember/December 2017) these payment options
are mostly in place.

In Vitro

Veritas

Inspired by the famous Buurtzorg model, this
prospective dApp will be built around the idea of
consumers being offered access to a range of
secure and affordable home-based health check-
up procedures. In some countries, express health
checkup services have become extremely popular.
Some of them are being delivered at home or at
work. For example, you don’t need to go to a med-
ical institution if you wish to make a blood test.
A qualified courier will visit you, take your blood
sample and deliver it to the lab where the actual
test will be performed.

However, services of this kind, particularly in un-
der-regulated markets, have a number of inherent
risks. First of all, home-based services mean that
the clients grant access to their homes to people
they do not know. Second, the qualifications of
those visitors may be in question. Third, clients
are exposed to health risks that might stem from
poorly designed service workflows. For example,
the nurse that takes blood samples may also be
expected to accept money from the clients, which
could have adverse or even catastrophic effects
on the client’s health through contagion.

To address those sensitive issues, Cryptaur in-
tends to create a dApp that would eliminate the
risks by making sure clients will be able to know
beforehand who they will welcome into their
homes, check the qualifications of those medical
workers and leave their unbiased reviews on the
quality of services they received. In addition to
this, Cryptaur will make sure the service workflow
is free from risky factors such as those related to
hygiene. Finally, the labs that would want to act as
contractors, will also be monitored for compliance
with a best practice checklist to be created in col-
laboration with Cryptaur’s partners who represent
some of the most respectable medical institutions

of the world, including the Russian Academy of
Medical Sciences, Wake Forest Institute of Regen-
erative Medicine and the Ukrainian Children’s Car-
diac Center.

Exact range of tests to be offered is yet to be de-
fined, but it will potentially embrace a wide range
of options from the traditional blood testing all the
way to the most advanced genetic and microbi-
ome tests. Thus, many health-aware consumers
will gain access to a diverse range of secure, con-
venient and affordable health check-up services.
Consumers’ privacy will also be a key consider-
ation for us while developing the application.
AgeHack

an,

Natural lifespan limits for humans are a hotly de-
bated topic nowadays. However, the general con-
sensus is that lifestyle has a decisive impact on
our life expectancy. But lifestyle is an extremely
multi-faceted notion, which makes it difficult for
a regular person to create and follow a meaning-
ful complex healthy regimen, let alone monitor the
benefits it is expected to bring.

Cryptaur’s founders have invaluable experience
in the realm of wellness in terms of health-related
products, quality of life management, and propri-
etary health assessment technologies. Based on
this experience, Cryptaur intends to build a dApp,
as a sub-sector of its whole ecosystem, to specifi-
cally unite those suppliers and consumers who

are particularly interested to “hack the age” and
achieve better results in terms of their general
well-being and longevity.

Users will get access to the best products and
techniques, enabling them to test, enhance, and
monitor their quality of life, as well as to be incen-
tivized for the healthy achievements they succeed
to make. Incentives are offered for the same type
of behaviors that are rewarded across all dApps in
the Cryptaur ecosystem, but specific to AgeHack
are additional incentives for the life extension
progress a user makes as it potentially adds more
time this user will be an active transaction maker
on our platform.

As essentially with all Cryptaur dApps, users of
AgeHack with appropriate skills can easily be-
come suppliers, e.g. by acting as fitness coaches,
nutrition advisors, or — more broadly — as quality
of life managers. We would expect that a new user
who is enthusiastic about their health will join the
dApp community as a consumer and after mak-
ing some noticeable progress will also act as a
“supplier” at least by sharing their experience with
others or at best becoming a real pro. Whatever
the role is, any contribution that is useful to the
community will be rewarded.

Prospective dApps Short List

At this stage, Cryptaur is considering a most di-
verse range of potential dApps it could welcome
into its ecosystem. The non-exhaustive list in-
cludes initiatives in the following domains:

1. Peer-to-peer Medical Advice Service with qual-
ified medical experts, including those who retired
from their active employment, to deliver online
consultations to those who need an independent
opinion on their health-related queries. The dApp
will provide an efficient medic/client matching en-
gine as well as a host of useful features such as
audio and video conferencing, direct file exchange
and storage (e.g. to send an x-ray scan), pay-as-
you-go tariffication model, the option to create ex-
pert groups (conciliums), in-app purchases in part-

nership with pharmaceutical distributors.

2. Household services offered by individual ex-
perts, including electricians, plumbers, baby sit-
ters and so forth, with strong control of their cre-
dentials by the system to make sure they can be
trusted and their services are of adequate quality.
The application, particularly its reputation man-
agement engine, would allow to give objective rat-
ings to both parties of an interaction making each
deal predictable, safe, and transparent. And last,
but not least, the peer-to-peer model of interaction
is expected to make the services cheaper to the
consumer and better paid for the supplier.

3. Tourist Guide Service for travelers who visit a
place where they do not have anyone they know.
Close to the concept of “rent-a-gent”, the service
allows a traveler to find a friend with adequate
background to show the visitor around and there-
by allow them to make the best use of their time
during the trip, safely and efficiently.

4. A home sharing/rent-a-flat dApp that would es-
sentially mimic the business model of services
like Airbnb but challenge them in terms of prices
and convenience. This decentralized application
should allow flat owners and tenants to find each
other and co-operate in a predictable way while
cutting the costs traditionally charged by the mid-
dleman. An extensive list of search criteria will be
cryptaur

available to better match the parties to a deal and
to share how their reciprocal expectations have
been met.

5. A peer-to-peer loan exchange platform is anoth-
er potential dApp for Cryptaur. Existing credit insti-
tutions are often too harsh on their clients in terms
of the eligibility criteria and the interest rates they
charge. The idea of this dApp is to bring together
those who are in need of a small- to mid-size loan
and those who have temporarily unused moneys
to offer at a moderate interest. A key element of
the system will be participants’ reputations. Apart
from lenders and borrowers as such, there may
be other roles in the system, e.g. participants who
would act as guarantors to particular borrowers or
those who would be willing to buy debts that are
overdue, etc.

6. A ride-sharing dApp to offer cheaper and safer
transportation options to the dApp users and a fair
income opportunity to the car owners who would
like to act as suppliers. Centralized ride sharing
services take anywhere from 15 to 30% of the fare
paid by the passenger. But it is drivers who spend

their time and gas and pay for the maintenance
of their vehicles. So why let a third party take that
big piece of the pie? With our dApp, the drivers will
keep the complete fare and just pay a very moder-
ate transaction and service fee in Cryptaur Tokens
(CPTs). In return, what they are expected to pro-
vide is good service quality and Cryptaur-compli-
ant behavior.

7. As we expect that the whole domain of educa-
tion is to be radically changed to co-opt the bene-
fits of modern technologies, a dedicated dApp will
be created to deliver individual or small-group ed-
ucational services online. Those able and willing
to teach will meet those willing to study, whereas
Cryptaur will audit the credentials of the teachers
and provide convenient learning environment and
settlement tools.

8. A specialized dApp may be developed for those
who are passionate about their pets. The function-
ality of this dApp will include a knowledge base on
how to take care of pets, a live advice service, and
most importantly — a complete blockchain-based
pedigree record for pets that are offered for sale.

tions that will be accepted by Cryptaur. The total
amount of Cryptaur tokens to be issued will be de-
termined by the results of the token presale that
ended on October 31, 2017, and the token sale that
will commence on November 27, 2017. All tokens
sold during presale and sale will together consti-
tute 30% of all tokens.

During the token sale, contributions may be made
in Ethers or Bitcoins. We also expect that token
sale participants will be offered an option to con-
tribute conveniently using their credit and debit
cards and/or bank transfers with certain coun-
try-dependent restrictions (TBC).

The base price of 1 CPT is established at $0.01.

Before participating in the Cryptaur token sale, please

Stage One

At this stage Cryptaur tokens (CPTs) will be sold
from November 27 through December 7, 2017 with
40% discount on the first day and 20% discount
thereafter. The minimum contribution will be $50
(in CPT equivalent). Participants will also benefit
from our referral program bounties available to
those who will hold at least 10000 CPTs in their
Cryptaur wallets by the bounty allocation time.
Bounties will be awarded in Ethers based on the
contributions of those who were invited into Crypt-
aur by a given participant or those invited by that
participant's invitees and so on according to the
following percentage scheme:

From Level 1: 3%
From Level 2: 3%
From Level 3: 3%
From Level 4: 3%
From Level 5: 4%
From Level 6: 4%

The bounty will be awarded with the so called
“compression procedure” applied, meaning that
those users who have less than 10000 CPTs in
their wallets by the time bounty is calculated, will

not participate in the bounty reward program and
their bounty-eligible downline users will be “pulled
up” to the next bounty-eligible user above them.
The compression procedure only affects the way
bounty is calculated at each given token sale
stage and does not otherwise affect the hierarchi-
cal group structure of groups of users.

Bounties will be calculated and awarded approxi-
mately one week after this token sale stage is over.
The awarded bounties can then be withdrawn to
any Ether wallet address or re-invested into CPTs.

In case of re-investment the discount will be 40%
on November 27, 2017 and then 20% till January
22, 2018.

Stage Two

At this stage Cryptaur tokens (CPTs) will be sold
from January 22 through January 31, 2018 with
20% discount on the first day and no discount
thereafter. The minimum contribution will be $50

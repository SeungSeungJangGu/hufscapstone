Q Qbic Manifesto

An Open Source Initiative Electronic Payment
System, a Payment Fulfilment System, and a thesis
on the Practical Application of a Mixed Economic
Model to Achieve Crypto Coin Stability

Narrative: In 2008, an unidentified cryptography enthusiast, decentralisation
advocate, and technology visionary, using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto wrote the
revolutionary whitepaper, Bitcoin: A peer-to-peer electronic cash system. The paper
defined the blueprint for the world’s first decentralised electronic currency, Bitcoin, and
became a catalyst for an evolution in the practical application of its concepts, namely
proof-of-work and coins derived from a chain of digital signatures, cryptographically
secured on a digital ledger, which later become known as the blockchain.

The history of Satoshi’s Bitcoin can be traced back to the Cypherpunks movement of
the late 1980’s and 1990’s and their philosophies on how to create a more open society
using advances in cryptography and computerisation. The movement promoted the use
of anonymity through strong cryptography to achieve genuine freedom of speech. This
was especially significant in oppressive societies where censorship and monitoring
were, and still are common practice.

In 1983, Richard Stallman founded the Freedom of Software movement and the GNU
Project. Several other freedom of software initiatives followed, including the Open
Source Initiative and its MIT License, which grants users the rights to use, copy,
modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software without
restriction. This project is licensed under the Open Source Initiative MIT License.

1. Introduction

The economy for digital currencies has grown 3000% in 2017 and a conservative
estimate is that it will double in size in 2018. This has led to a modern day gold rush
with prospectors from all walks of life rushing in to stake their claim in any one or more
of 1520 active ‘Gold mines’. Zero or limited regulation has also led to an influx of
dishonest enterprises touting unfeasible roadmaps and the promise of high returns
while hiding behind a veil of anonymity*. Founders that have nothing on the line, even
if only their identities, are more likely to walk away when the going gets tough. In some
circumstances, the founders, unable to establish a crypto currency with any real value,
can escape via the project back door, and dump their remaining coins onto the market
at the expense of their own investors.
Q Qbic Manifesto

*It ought to be distinguished between the rights to anonymity in open society in the
pursuit of freedom of speech, and expecting the same privileges as an anonymous
project team asking for investment from the general public. The former is both legally
and socially acceptable; the latter is ethically tenuous to say the least.

This paper will define a blueprint for an ethical project based on sound fundamentals,
transparency, and an effective economic policy.

2. Blockchain as a Codebase (BaaC)

We define BaaC as Bitcoin or any other alternative currency system that is licensed
under the GNU Project General Public License (GPL) or any open source software
initiative, that is/can be used as a donor blockchain codebase.

The genesis of Bitcoin has given rise to numerous competing electronic payment
systems, many of which use or ‘fork’ the Bitcoin original codebase, pursuant to the GPL
license agreement. Does this mean the forked project is any less legitimate than
Bitcoin? The answer, of course lies in the motives of the founders and the problem they
aim to address by taking what is essentially Bitcoin in a new direction. If project teams
have a genuine motive, an opportunity, and the capabilities to use and improve any
freedom of software codebase, this is a perfectly acceptable use case, and no less
legitimate than the original codebase. The caveat being that free software should be
improved for the benefit of users and the community. Any fork of Bitcoin should aim at
being a future fork of another project.

Before investing in any project, the ‘investor’ should assess the founders’ motives,
transparency, and capabilities.

3. A Mixed Economic Model for a Cryptocurrency Project

Cryptocurrencies operate in a free market and are subject to the kind of excessive
volatility not seen trading any other asset class. This is a clear obstacle in the way of
mass adoption and whilst traders and speculators revel with each new market high,
price collapses are common, and are a factor limiting mass adoption. A mixed market
economy refers to the degree of state interventionism in a market economy, and in the
case of a cryptocurrency project, the ‘state’ would be whoever within the project controls
both the treasury fund and the treasury reserve fund.

An important distinction at this point is that of treasury fund and treasury reserve
fund. A treasury fund is made up entirely of the projects native currency, usually this
fund is plentiful. A treasury reserve fund is made up of currency from the opposing side
of the main trading pair, in most cases this is Bitcoin (BTC).
Q Qbic Manifesto

To understand the financial dynamics and challenges of most cryptocurrency projects,
it is important to know where they start out from. Below is a summary of the three
funding options available to most projects:

Initial Coin Offering (ICO) — Ideal situation for any project to start out.
Speculators buy the premined or tokenised native currency of the project in
exchange for Bitcoin or Ethereum. ICOs usually result in a medium to large
treasury reserve fund and a large treasury fund.

Coin Auctions — Usually coin auctions are the domain of anonymous project
teams. The auctions generate a small to medium treasury reserve fund and the
founders’ premine of between 1.5% and 10% of their native currency makes for a
very large treasury fund.

Direct to Exchange — Direct to exchange cryptocurrencies, unless funded by
venture capitalists, start their project life with a small treasury reserve fund and
a large treasury fund.

A fourth option is available for an innovative project team:

Treasury Fund Offering (TFO) — The treasury fund offering is a concept proposed
by this paper to build a projects’ treasury reserve fund in parallel with an in-
flight project. Speculators buy the native currency direct from the treasury fund
and their BTC payment is placed, in part, into the reserve fund. The complete
mechanism is described in subsequent sections.

As a word to the wise, the downside to any project holding a large treasury fund and a
small treasury reserve fund is obvious, in that they have little or no real funding. This
is the death zone for most projects and the highest risk investment for the speculator.

4. Treasury Reserve Fund Mechanisms
Treasury Fund Offering (TFO)

In order to fully participate in a mixed economic model, a project needs a sizable
treasury reserve fund. This paper proposes a mechanism for building the reserve fund
without risking any reserve capital. The Mechanism is a combination of a Treasury
Fund Offering (TFO), the commitment on the part of the Treasury to use up to 85% of
the TFO funds to buy back its native coins, and the treasury commitment to buy into
buy walls or if under selling pressure, place these funds plus additional reserve funds
into buy positions at tactical support levels.

The diagram illustrates four individual traders placing buy orders at varying prices.
The buyers are chancing the price will fall into their orders. In a mixed economic
project model, buyers are aware of the Reserve Fund Mechanism and the treasury’s
commitment to support the price at pre-determined support levels, which could result

3
Q Qbic Manifesto

in intervention at any point. Would the buyers follow the same psychological thought
process knowing the treasury may move the price, or are they more likely to buy at a
higher price?

Another supposition is the net effect of consolidating the four individual orders into one
larger order would have a greater impact on price than if the four were to left to their
own devices. One could surmise that the individual buys would have zero effect on price
if the price has to come down for the orders to be fulfilled. Another supposition is that
maybe the buyers get bored of waiting and buy into the sell wall anyway, and this
would have a greater net effect than 85% of the consolidated treasury reserve fund.

The only guarantee in any of this is that the treasury via the reserve fund will buy into
the sell wall. We cannot guarantee the individuals will.

Treasury Fund - Free Market

A secondary method of growing the treasury reserve fund is the sale of treasury funds
ethically ‘on-exchange’ into the free market. The project position on this mechanism
should be simple, if the price declines as a result of treasury intervention, the
mechanism is not working. Market timing is key, where market sentiment is leaning
towards buying. Buy walls will be higher than sell walls at 1% either side of the mid
spread price. The treasury will place small sell orders into the spread. The market
sentiment will remain in favour of buyers throughout and if the sentiment changes in
favour of sellers, the treasury orders will be cancelled. Treasury sell orders will not be
entered into sell walls and will have a positive impact on price by way of temping
buyers into the spread.

The use of Automation

In order to maximise the timing and effectiveness of exchange market orders,
automation should be developed using the exchange(s) proprietary application
programming interfaces (API). Automation should be used in all exchange based
trading scenarios, from building the treasury reserve fund, providing liquidity, and
defending support zones.

Treasury Fund Income

The payment solution allows for speculators to purchase the right to operate a highly
incentivised part of the network (Qnodes). In an ethical project, the project team may
have chosen to premine an amount of native currency. Whilst the treasury fund is of
lesser importance in the early phases of the project than the treasury reserve fund, it is
vital for Treasury Fund Offering (TFO) purchases of the native currency. Therefore, the
project team should consider a source of perpetual income via their own incentivised
network. It would be seen as an ethical position to have access to treasury funding via
Q Qbic Manifesto

the same income source as your investors. The project team would be more incentivised
to ensure the network is operational and efficient if they too participate in it.

Macroeconomic Policy

The payment solution defined in this paper has four market participants. These
participants are miners, Qnode operators, merchants, and the community/consumers.
The objective of macroeconomic policy is to use whatever tools are available to the
project team, to control the benefits of participating in the network in favour of those
participants that are key to evolutionary phases. Miners and Qnode operators are early
evolutionary phase priorities, whereas as the project evolves, the policies must also
evolve to address the needs of merchants and consumers. The project team must try to
establish a ‘sweet spot’ of incentivisation at each phase of the project, with the eventual
target being a macroeconomic policy that benefits all market participants, fine-tuned in
line with economic data.

The early phases of the project will mainly consist of on-chain incentivisation (block
time, block rewards distribution split). As the project evolves, microeconomic policy may
become a combination of on-chain and off-chain incentivations, with on-chain options
evolving, such as the possibility of staking wallets for consumers and merchants.

Incentivisation Types - On-Chain/Off-Chain

On-chain incentivisation is that of using the economic tools available to the project
team and fine tuning the parameters to meet the needs of market participants. As the
illustrations in the previous section show, the aim should be to eventually find a sweet
spot of incentives across all participants but, the reality is such that if there is a

7
Q Qbic Manifesto

confliction of incentives between two or more market participants, the evolution of the
project and the most sought after market participant group must always be the
priority.

Off-chain incentivisation is the capability of the project team, both in terms of
quantifiable results and perceived ability. Typical factors are:

Capabilities — Strengths, skills.

Agility — Reaction to events.
Recruitment — New capabilities.

Communication — Transparency,

Trustworthiness. Ideas — Strategy, Innovation.

Mixed Economics — Price Support

The project, via the treasury reserve fund, will have the ability to intervene in the free
market to assist the community at known support levels during periods of bearish
sentiment. Technical analysis is a powerful tool if all market participants know the
treasury and the reserve fund may enter the market at support levels. The project will
grow the treasury reserve fund as ethically as possible. The illustration below is an
example of an up-trend (BTC-USD). Support levels can be found along the trend line.
Should the price break through the trend line, the logical next support level would be at
parallel touch points.

Mixed Economics - Liquidity

In times of low selling liquidity, the project, via the treasury fund will aim to provide
resistance on exchanges. Whilst this appears to be at odds with the treasury reserve
fund mechanism, it is a deliberate act to quell sharp rises in native currency price.
Sharp rises are detrimental to the evolution of the currency because of the equally
sharp pull backs that usually accompany them, and prove a hindrance to attracting
new investors if they feel they ‘missed the opportunity’ to invest. With little liquidity in
selling positions, a medium size buyer could push the price hundreds of percent,
making the currency appear too expensive. This is contrary to popular belief that all
‘moons’ are great for the crypto economy. It is my belief that a ‘moon’ should occur over
a prolonged period of time and at a steady pace, picking up as many investors as
possible along the way.

The illustration below is that of the danger of low liquidity in selling positions. On a
coin with a daily volume of up to $30,000, a mere $5000 buy order could push the price
up 400%.

The treasury must attempt to halt such large rises by providing liquidity, albeit at

Q Qbic Manifesto

Of course, the reverse of the above scenario is the unhealthiest situation for any
currency. Little liquidity on the buying side causes sellers to sell in buy walls and the
same $5000 order could have a catastrophic effect on the price. The treasury fund
mechanisms, including the quelling of unsustainable price rises, will ensure the
projects treasury reserve fund is sufficient enough to prevent price collapses at support
levels.

5. An MIT License Electronic Payment System

For the payment system, we intend to implement a BaaC solution and customise the
code to suit the needs of all market participants. In selecting a codebase, we first need
to select our desired consensus mechanism. This comes down to whether mining (Proof
of Work) or staking (Proof of Stake) is the preferred method for adding transactions to
new blocks on the network. Whilst both offer incentivisation for network participation,
Proof of Stake only pays the transaction fees to the block creator and therefore has not
been adopted by many projects to date. Proof of Work, on the other hand, offers the
transaction fees and rewards of newly minted coins, and for this reason it is the
preferred choice of most new cryptocurrency projects. Therefore, the superior
incentivisation of Proof of Work as a consensus mechanism is more suited to the
objectives of the project at this time.

Blockchain as a Core (BaaC) Specifications

With Proof of Work selected as the consensus mechanism, we need to select a suitable
codebase for the blockchain. Rewarding all market participants is a primary objective of
this project and of all codebases, Dash offers the most incentivised network solution.
Dash nodes, and therefore node operators, receive a share of any mining rewards, in
return for performing network functionality beyond that of the Bitcoin core, such as
private send transactions and instant send transactions.

For the remainder of the electronic payment system section, only the key
differentiators from Dash will be defined.

ASIC Resistant Mining

Dash uses the X11 algorithm based on Scrypt, which has now reached a hash difficulty
uneconomical to mine using commodity GPU hardware. ASIC mining hardware is
difficult to attain, and manufactured by only a handful of companies. There is now the
argument that ASIC mining is becoming too centralised. The objective of this project is
to create a level playing field for all mining participants, free from the constraints of
specialist hardware and free to use affordable commodity hardware. For this reason,
the ASIC resistant hashing algorithm, Neoscrypt has been selected.

Neoscrypt is also based on Scrypt, and has addressed some of the latter’s known
security vulnerabilities. Neoscrypt is ASIC resistant whereas Scrypt and X11 are not.

6. A Payment Fulfilment System

The payment system defined in section 5 of this paper outlines a BaaC payment
system, and its differentiators from the original codebase. The system, confined to
within its own system boundary, is a mechanism for internal exchange only and has no
real use case outside of the mechanism. This is typical of most digital currencies and is
the biggest criticism of the industry.

11
Q Qbic Manifesto

There are a great many projects in the world trying to legitimise digital currencies.
Bitcoin, despite its ‘first mover’ advantage, its huge market capitalisation, and its wide
adoption amongst cryptocurrency enthusiasts and traders, has yet to be accepted as a
legitimate currency ready for mass adoption. In order to create a genuine alternative
token of value for mass adoption, a digital currency must satisfy some key criteria,
namely, stability and/or proxy stability, ease of attainability, and ease of exchange.

Sections 3 and 4 of this paper define an economic policy for coin stability, and proposes
the practicality of two treasury funds, the treasury fund and the treasury reserve fund,
and how they may be used for coin stability. In view of the economic principles within
this paper, and in analysing the current industry ecosystem, we are able to design a
fully functional payment fulfilment solution that could legitimise a digital currency by
offering an end to end platform of exchange.

The Merchant Obstacle

Merchants are the last and most difficult market participant in the way of mass
adoption. The reason for this is simple, they have bills to pay. Each of the other three
participants are speculators, hopefully investing money they can afford to lose, all the
while in the knowledge that they have nowhere to spend the digital currency they have
just acquired. The merchant obstacle is the key to adoption, and using the existing
industry ecosystem, alongside the economic policies on this paper, and the solution
defined below, merchants should no longer be such the obstacle.

The Scenario

For this scenario, we are going to use a fictional barber shop. The barber charges $10
for a haircut. The customer pays $10 and we assume the barber then deposits the $10
into his or her bank account. They do, of course, have the inconvenience of walking to
the bank but this is a necessary and accepted downside to a cash business. The process
is easy, as illustrated below:

BARBER SHOP

Customer Merchant

Py e Haircut ‘
tf —z— f-=

Besides the simplicity of the above transaction, the most significant benefit is that the
rate of exchange is reliable. $10 is $10 and so long as the $dollar is not subject to

12
Q Qbic Manifesto

overnight hyperinflation, the $10 is worth the same next week as it was at the time of
the customer’s haircut.

The Problem Statement

How do we provide the merchant with the same guarantees? Digital currencies
experience hyperinflation most days of the week, and any responsible merchant is not
going to take a chance on exchanging his digital currency for 10% of the value it was at
the time of the haircut. Even if we can guarantee the value, can we, in the current
ecosystem, exchange a digital currency for $ and move the $ amount to the merchants
bank account seamlessly from the perspective of the merchant, and without the
merchant visiting an exchange?

The Proposed Solution

Our solution is to guarantee the value of our digital currency at the time of the
payment to the merchant, and to facilitate an automated fulfilment of the payment into
the merchant’s bank account.

We do this by implementing a ‘middle man’ component called the Treasury Fulfilment
Service (TFS). The TFS is essential a decentralised exchange (DEX) within the projects
infrastructure. The merchant, via his mobile app, creates an account on the TFS. He

13
Q Qbic Manifesto

links his bank account to his TFS account. His mobile now has a connection to his
merchant account on the TFS.

A customer, also using the projects mobile app, chooses to pay for his haircut in Qbic
and scans the merchants QR code. The app gets a live value for Qbic vs $US dollar (1
Qbic = $10) and an instant send payment is made.

The merchant, in no rush to deposit his Qbic into his bank account as $ Dollars, waits a
few days and then, via the app, withdraws the $ Dollar amount to his bank account.

The TFS, leveraging the treasury fund for proxy stability, and with links to various
exchanges, exchanges the merchants Qbic for $ Dollars and transfers the money to the
merchants bank account.

Proxy Stability

Proxy stability is a mechanism of a future merchant incentivisation policy whereby the
treasury provides merchants with a guaranteed future value for the project’s native
currency. The treasury does this by leveraging the treasury fund within the projects
own decentralised exchange, the Treasury Fulfilment Service (TFS). The TFS will be a
fully automated trading system with links via APIs into relevant exchanges. The
merchant is guaranteed the $ or BTC value at the time of original payment.

As an example;
Using the same scenario as above:

The Qbic price appreciates by 20% during the time between payment and fulfilment,
the TFS, having calculated a surplus in the value, exchanges 0.8 Qbic for the
equivalent $ value, and earns a profit of 0.2 Qbic.

The Qbic price depreciates by 20% during the time between payment and fulfilment,
the TFS, having calculated a deficit in the value, exchanges 1.2 Qbic for the equivalent
$ value, and earns a loss of 0.2 Qbic.

This is made possible by a plentiful treasury fund; especially if, by taking advantage of
their own incentivisation policies, the project invests in its own infrastructure and
earns a perpetual income, in addition to its premined coins.

7. Breaking Through Boundaries: The Qbic Ecosystem

The Qbic ecosystem will follow a three step evolutionary model. The first phase was
building the system, its processes, and its network. The second phase is building out
the ecosystem to cater for specific use cases and aims at fostering adoption outside of
visionaries and enthusiasts. The third phase is that of leveraging the successes of phase
two alongside rising adoption rates, and a softening of stances amongst key industry
groups, such as banking. Any roadmap has to cater for these phases to be feasible. The
illustration below defines the project’s evolutionary roadmap (high level).

8. Conclusion

It is my hypothesis that this paper adequately describes a high potential digital
currency, an effective economic policy, and a real world use case within the industry
ecosystem that could lead to mass adoption. There will be many use cases as the
industry evolves, including debit cards, and the quickest and most capable teams to
react will become household names. Within 12 months digital currencies will connect to

payment networks outside of their own system boundaries and the age of crypto will
have arrived.

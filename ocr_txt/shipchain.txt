ABSTRACT

Consider the magnitude of the logistics industry. Looking back through history, the wheel is essentially
the cornerstone of modern civilization. It brought us transportation, and transportation afforded us the
systematic transfer of goods. From farm to market, and from market to table, the movement of products
in bulk has been the single most important adaptation of the last 10,000 years.

Trade, in turn, is our second oldest and most important pivot. From long-distance trading, our econo-
mies were established, which allowed modern civilizations to thrive. The oldest coin-based currency can
be thought of as a proxy for trading values greater than two hands can carry, or for trading commodities
that aren’t physically available nearby, and so currency itself necessitates logistics. Together, trade and
logistics form the backbone of human achievement.

Despite the revolution brought on by the advent of the cart, the ship, the engine, and the airplane, the
shipping industry as a whole has been one of the slowest markets to adapt and evolve over the past
century. The Information Age has disrupted nearly every major workforce on the planet. Globalization
has opened new trade routes, technology has changed the way we shop and spend, and so naturally,
the demand for shipping has reached an all-time high. It's no wonder that most shipping customers are
shocked and dismayed to find their brokers still relying on artifacts like paper records, written manifests,
and spoken words to get cargo from point to point. It’s time for a breakthrough in how we handle freight.

Blockchain technology is often characterized as “disruptive” because it can revolutionize the way we
interact as a society. Distributed ledgers are disruptive for ancient business models in the same way
email disrupted the mailbox. Applied correctly, a blockchain will facilitate the digitization of record-
keeping processes related to the trade of assets, even in scenarios when intermediaries and brokers are
incentivized to resist revolution. The blockchain can improve the transportation of commodities in every
country, across the entire globe, and beyond. We're launching ShipChain to make that leap possible.

OVERVIEW

The movement of goods impacts daily life for
people around the world at a staggering scale.
For additional perspective, here are some stats:

e¢ The market's global value was $8.1 trillion in
2015, and is expected to grow to $15.5 tril-
lion by 2023 (1), making it one of the largest
industries on the planet.

¢ 55 billion tons of freight was transported in
2015, with expected growth to 92 billion
tons by 2024.

e In the United States, freight and logistics
spend in 2015 totaled $1.48 trillion, nearly
10% of the country’s GDP (2).

Unfortunately, the supply chain has major
bottlenecks. The lack of a unified communica-

tion platform prevents the various players from
interacting efficiently. Most land transportation
providers, carriers, governments, customs bro-
kers, and freight forwarders have outdated ways
of keeping track of their goods. According to

SUPPLIER MANUFACTURER

KPMG, 40% of global manufacturers lack infor-
mation and material visibility across their supply
bases (3). In some cases, companies are still us-
ing paper ledgers to track their products. Given
that upwards of 65% of the value of a company’s
products or services is derived from its suppliers
and its supply chain (4), utilizing older highly in-
effective systems results in tremendous amounts

of wasted time, resources, and money.

But as freight volume increases, so do custom-
er expectations. Both industrial and individual
customers expect faster shipments with more
flexibility, more transparency, and lower prices.
Shippers can find it challenging to handle all the
complexities of booking, tracking, tracing, and
regulatory compliance, unless they hire teams

of full-time, experienced staff. This puts smaller
shippers at a disadvantage, and makes larger
shippers extremely inefficient.

CONSUMER

SHIPGHAIN

The process of shipping freight can occur across many
channels, including air, sea, rail, or truck. Four major en-
tities make up the lifecycle of any shipment, regardless
of the channel being used.

Shippers are the customers of the logistics services; they
are the actors who have freight and need it transported.
¢ Shippers don’t want to coordinate multiple drivers

e They don't want logistics headaches

e They want a predictable price

¢ Shippers want freight accountability

Brokers coordinate carriers to organize multimodal
orders

¢ Brokers act as the gatekeepers of the industry

e They choose combinations of reputable carriers

e They get payment from shippers and insure goods
e They often provide some basic tracking services

e Brokers charge a high middle-man markup

Carriers provide freight transportation services

e Carriers may be rail, air, sea, truck, or other

¢ Most carriers only handle one segment of a trip

e Usually, a multi-leg trip involves several carriers

e Acarrier usually owns a fleet of delivery vehicles

¢ Carriers often have poor transparency and records

Drivers are the operators of a single vehicle in a fleet

¢ Some are “owner-operators” acting also as Carriers
e Sometimes handoffs lack accountability

e Tracking fleets of drivers can be hard

e Drivers don't have incentives to save gas

e Drivers can lose or damage goods

PROBLEMS

1. Bad Tracking. For end-users, the regularity
and reliability of shipping status updates is the
primary factor in the perceived quality of a ship-
ping experience. If a package is slow or late, but
has regular updates, customers are less likely to
complain or file chargebacks against merchants.
But the shipping industry has not kept up. Track-
ing across multiple carriers is extremely fractured,
and tracking provisions vary between modes of
transportation. Tracking problems lead to con-
fusion among carriers, failed handoffs, failed de-
liveries, and even lost shipments. Economically,
this is a disaster. Lost efficiency, wasted fuel and
time, and missing products combine to cost the
shipping industry billions of dollars per year--
costs that brokers rarely cover and are ultimately
passed on to shippers.

2. Lack of Transparency. Bad tracking is both
the cause-of and caused-by equally harmful gaps
in transparency. While tracking issues are system-
ic and inherent to the task of moving goods, the
failures of transparency are largely due to bad
data handling practices (or worse, due to parties
being incentivized not to share accurate data).
Often, due to fragmentation, uncertainty, or to
protect the exclusivity of their arrangements, bro-
kers can’t or won't tell a shipper exactly what car-
rier and driver are carrying their freight.

3. No Accountability. The US Federal Bureau of
Investigations estimates annual cargo theft loss-
es exceeding $30 billion USD in 2016 and rising,
with an average theft value of $190,000 (5). Car-
go theft raises prices across the industry approx-
imately 20%, negatively impacting all customers
of the shipping industry-nearly every person on
earth. The combination of tracking and transpar-
ency failures together lead to a lack of account-

ability. As brokers withhold information on who is
moving which cargo and fragmentation amongst
carriers causes uncertainty about where the car
go actually is at any given time, shippers often
have no way of knowing who is responsible for
the cargo. Handoffs are one of the largest sourc-
es of error in freight, with neither side wanting
to take responsibility for a container that didn’t
make it from the ship to a truck.

4. Middleman Markup. Brokers and forwarders
are largely to blame for all of the above issues,
acting as gatekeepers to the industry and incen-
tivizing poor transparency and tracking practices,
and yet they typically charge a significant premi-
um-sometimes 30-50%-for their claim of mak-
ing freight easier to manage and ship. In reality,
they are high maintenance, increasing the cost
of freight and decreasing what carriers get paid.

5. Misaligned Incentives. The above issues
can be summarized simply as a problem of mis-
aligned incentives. It behooves carriers to provide
poor tracking because they gain deniability in the
case of lost or damaged freight. There’s nega-
tive incentive for brokers to be honest about the
whereabouts or handlers of a shipment because
they need to protect their exclusive relationships
and always be able to shift the blame. Drivers are
incentivized to carry using unsafe practices that
may risk damage to goods. Everyone gains from
dishonesty to the next party and to break laws
or safety regulations. Shippers and customers are
thus incentivized to find a better solution.

SHIPGHAIN

ShipChain was founded with the mission of solving the greatest problems facing the logistics industry
today. Our solution requires deep technology, but our vision is quite simple. Imagine a fully integrated
system across the entire supply chain--from the moment it leaves the factory, field, or farm--to deliv-
ering the finished product to the customer's doorstep; federated in trustless, transparent blockchain
contracts. This is ShipChain, the future of shipping.

Tracking & Transparency

We will unify shipment tracking across the Ethereum blockchain, using our ShipChain side-chain to track
individual encrypted geographic waypoints across each smart contract. With this system, the meaning of
each waypoint will be encrypted, accessible for interpretation by only the parties involved. This will give
shippers more visibility across their supply chain and allow carriers to communicate with ease, reducing
delays and miscommunications. Information about loads, geo-waypoints, and basic compliance infor
mation will be recorded and publicly validated within the sidechain. Upon delivery and confirmation,
the contract will be completed and recorded on the main blockchain, releasing any payment escrows.

With the upcoming Electronic Log Device (ELD) mandate from the United States Department of Trans-
portation (6), ShipChain will work with the most popular ELD developers to integrate directly and march
toward our first goal: completion of Track & Trace technology. The initial step of working with these
providers will allow us to integrate immediately into the largest network of US-based trucking freight
companies, giving our platform a full network of freight movement without the arduous requirement
of connecting to individual freight companies (or even individual Owner-operator trucks) one at a time.
PAGE 8

Similarly, there is an opportunity for us to integrate with the major US railroads, global ocean freight
providers, and major airlines, one-by-one, to tie in and create our multimodal blockchain-based track-
ing system. The internal tracking of each carrier will be the first step in unification, with their internal
confirmations being fed to the blockchain. Individual pallets or crates will be tied to the address of the
container they are on, and containers will be tracked as a whole. Over time, business development will
assist these carriers with the replacement of their base internal tracking with the ShipChain system, al-
lowing a greater level of visibility across all of their multimodal shipping partners.

Decentralized Brokerage

In the current system, freight brokers exist to facilitate the transactions of loads from shippers to carriers;
they are typically asset-light and focused on sales. Brokers find loads, mark them up, and sell them to
a carrier, which increases the cost of shipping and reduces profits for carriers and their crew. The Ship-
Chain blockchain will supplant the need for brokers by allowing carriers the ability to find shipments and
intelligently route their team for multimodal transportation based on factors such as distance, traffic,
weather conditions, fuel use and more. This load system will generate a smart contract upon pick-up
and will hold payments in escrow until conditions for release are met while using the main blockchain
and side-chain for tracking and cargo security monitoring.

Asset Security

Deploying blockchain technology into the freight industry to encode geographic data will increase car-
go visibility, and thereby dramatically decrease theft. By using barcodes or hardware RFID integration,
assets can be automatically verified each time electronic logs are reported, increasing security and pro-
viding peace-of-mind for all parties. Permissioning, immutability, and encryption are inherent benefits
of blockchain technology, allowing select individuals to access, examine, and add critical transport data,
but no one will have the ability to change or delete existing data. By bringing accountability to every
step of the process, the blame game between carriers, brokers and shippers is mitigated.

Trustless Incentives

By encoding and encrypting waypoint information and data about which loads belong in a shipment,
digital escrows can be used to fairly assess whether goods actually arrived in a particular shipment. Con-
flicting accounts of the whereabouts of goods are eliminated, and individual players can be rewarded
for their participation in a system that operates without trusting any particular party’s story about what
happened. In future iterations of the platform, we plan to provide driver rewards for obeying speed
limits, behaving safely, and observing green fuel economy practices.

Unified Management

Subsequent to the implementation of blockchain federation of the fair and secure transportation of
goods, ShipChain will build a unified management platform for leveraging the smart contracts to pro-
vide modern and usable services across the shipping industry. ShipChain is dedicated to building to
an open ecosystem, and although ShipChain Web will be the first application, our Smart Contracts will
be a building-block that thousands of other platforms can freely build upon to solve shipping issues,
big or small. The decentralized brokerage will be an open marketplace connecting shippers to carriers,
and ShipChain will provide the first app for cargo booking; shippers will be able to log on and place an

TECHNOLOGY

Contracts & Side-Chains

The ShipChain Contract is an Ethereum EVM smart contract that can be duplicated and used by anyone
to orchestrate a shipping escrow on the distributed ledger. The overall shipment completion will be
stored on the main Ethereum blockchain, and to keep costs low, individual tracking waypoints and load
data can be stored and verified in an associated side-chain operating on the ShipChain Protocol (fork of
Ethereum software), such as the one ShipChain Foundation will implement and maintain called “Ship-
Chain Prime.” Large partners will be able to operate their own ShipChain Protocol side-chains, with (or
without) aid from ShipChain Foundation.

When a shipment order is placed, a smart contract will be initiated. That contract will include a hash sum
signature of the delivery information for the shipment, including beginning address, final delivery point,
carriers used, number of items in shipment (as granular as preferred with an address for each item being
possible), weight, dimensions, quantities, HS codes, intermediary data, and more. Anyone with a valid
copy of these values can verify the signature and assert the validity of the contract on the main Ethere-
um blockchain. The data itself can optionally be encrypted and stored in a sidechain for more specific
point-by-point and piecewise package tracking. In result, this essentially provides a more detailed Bill
of Lading.

That contract will be completed on delivery, with validations and waypoints recorded to the blockchain
along the way. If all waypoint validations are affirmed, the contract will be executed (and each contract
will be able to specify its own terms for how any disputes will be resolved, including third party arbitra-
tion). The full cargo validation system will be in place alongside the tracking system. Carrier partners will
be able to pull data from the ShipChain tracking system and post to their systems and websites for wide
use, creating a unified tracking system that eliminates the need for internal P.R.O. numbers or multiple
tracking numbers.

ShipChain Web

The decentralized brokerage system will be comprised primarily of an open marketplace connecting
shippers and carriers. ShipChain will allow open access to its blockchain marketplace, but also build the
first platform of services upon it, ShipChain Web Platform, a centralized system for booking and man-
aging freight shipments across many carriers and modes of transportation.

If for example, the shipper has five full shipping containers of shoes coming from China to the United
States, the system will recognize that a sea carrier, rail carrier, and final truck carrier will be the best op-
timization for cost and speed based on the size and type of shipment. The shipper will then be able to
see the capacity on each leg, book their own routes, see estimated delivery times, and have full control
over their supply chain without the need for a broker.

Carriers will be able to post capacity for their shipping vehicles and lanes, dynamically set pricing based
on supply/demand, adjust for estimated fuel cost, and have cargo booked to their routes automatically.

PAGE 10 SHIPGHAIN

Customs brokers, if needed, will also be granted account rights to assist with paperwork filing. With all
necessary information held in a smart contract, this process will be quicker and easier than ever before.
Regulatory compliance may require ShipChain to be licensed in freight brokerage, freight forwarding,
and have an internal customs brokerage. While shippers will book their own routes, ShipChain may
need to be the official booking agent for freight, for compliance purposes.

THE SHIP TOKEN

Usage, Purpose, Supply and Demand
Ownership of at least 1 full SHIP token grants “ShipChain Membership Status.” This is required to access
the blockchain for both the purpose of tracking shipments, as well as the purpose of booking freight.

Transactions on the blockchain for freight shipments will be paid in tokens, and settled in tokens. The
ShipChain Web platform connecting to the blockchain will allow users to pay either directly in tokens
they hold, or purchase tokens from ShipChain for booking freight (allowing, for example, USD, EUR or
cryptocurrency payment).

Tokens valued at up to 20% of each freight transaction will be given to the driver/carrier as “gamified”
incentives for safe and timely deliveries, as well as environment focused such as reduced idle time. From
there, drivers will either be able to sell their tokens on exchanges, or redeem those tokens via partner-
ships ShipChain will form for various rewards, such as gift cards, fuel discounts, and more.

Initial Token Generation Event

The problems ShipChain will tackle are systemic to a multi-trillion dollar industry, one historically slow
moving and resistant to change. We have plans for delivering our offering on our current funding, but
bringing our full vision to life is a huge endeavor and would be best served by opening ourselves to
outside funding. Therefore we are running a Token Generation Event or “TGE” to sell an initial supply
of our tokens in order to jumpstart the ShipChain economy and supplement funding to help us deliver
the best product possible.

This ‘TGE’ will occur in multiple phases, including Pre-Sale, Sale 1, and Sale 2. Pre-Sale and Sale 1 will
occur immediately, ending after January 2018. Sale 2 will occur upon the completion of several mile-
stones, including the live use of our web platform, version 1.0 of our full tracking system, and generation
of live revenues with real client shipments. We anticipate Sale 2 will occur between 1-2 years after Sale
1.

Good Driver Initiatives

ShipChain is committed to making the world a better place and protecting the environment from the
harmful effects of greenhouse gas emissions. Our plan includes a retainer of 13% of the total supply of
tokens to be distributed over 5 or more years as incentives for ecologically responsible driving at safe
speeds. By offering these rewards, we ensure that the safe and timely delivery of goods is the top pri-
ority for everyone.

EXAMPLE USER STORIES

In order to illustrate some cases where ShipChain might be most useful, we've invented a few fictional
stories about made-up companies — based on real problems faced by thousands of similar businesses
across the world. Any similarities to actual brands and trademarks are either innocent coincidences or
systemic commonalities

The Major Food Production Company

Chik-A-Burg Meats is facing increasing regulatory burden from the USDA and FDA with harsh fines and
penalties for non-compliance, requiring end-to-end tracking of anything that touches the food supply.
New rules in the Food Safety Modernization Act say that livestock feed must be traced from farm to
trough, food products must be tracked throughout the supply chain, and all transport trailers need
audit logs of their prior loads and cleaning histories. Larger third-party freight companies are hesitant
to comply, which forces Chik-A-Burg to hire mostly independent drivers who feel overburdened by this
new litany of checks and measures.

Enter ShipChain: a novel blockchain solution that allows Chik-A-Burg to instantly find and connect with
drivers and carriers who meet their regulatory needs. The loads previously carried in their trucks can
be verified as not hazardous waste, medical equipment, nor other non-compliant materials — without
revealing sensitive information about previous clients — validating that the loads would comply with
food supply chain safety mandates. Using the ShipChain Prime side-chain for granular tracking, RFID
and barcodes can be combined with ELD integrations allowing full traceability and visibility of supply,
literally from farm to table. Retailers, carriers, and customers alike can all validate the source farm, lot
number, distribution center, port information, and even individual trailer on a burger-by-burger basis. If
a closer audit is needed, regulatory authorities can be provided a set of private encryption keys allowing
them access to the full history of a given trailer’s loads and hauls.

The eCommerce Retailer

AmazingSocks.club needs to ship a container of fleece footwear from the supplier in China to their
warehouse in Chicago, but they won't use a broker because of bad experiences with dishonest inter
mediaries charging 50% fees just to lose their shipments. Instead, they have hired Steve, full-time (plus
nights and weekends) staff member whose only job is to research carriers and plan the logistics of mov-
ing socks around the globe. Steve is a highly skilled logistics professional, but due to the time involved
in planning ships across the ocean, consulting with customs at the port, and negotiating with indepen-
dent owner-operators, his role is now the bottleneck preventing AmazingSocks from scaling up to meet
the Christmas rush and have a record O4. Now management needs to hire a second Steve, which will
push logistics to over 12% of sock company’s payroll.

ShipChain can help. Using ShipChain Web, Steve can fill the role of a mega shipping broker, using our
advanced interface to search and filter compatible sea freight, customs agents, and schedule handoffs
between multiple drivers. He can quickly find and match any combination of drivers and freighters to
meet his needs based on pricing, speed or freight class — or he can request bids from operators not on

PAGE 15 SHIPGHAIN

the marketplace. Once Steve is satisfied with all the data available on the website in front of him, he
clicks “Create Contract And Pay”, charging the company credit card and placing the full manifest on the
blockchain. Now one Steve can do the job of four, moving more socks faster and eating dinner with his
family instead of waiting on hold.

The Freelance Freight Broker

A co-op of a dozen owner-operators in the southeast has grouped together to handle booking and
coordination of freight amongst themselves, eschewing carrier. After several years of informally calling
one another to ask about availability and scheduling, a broken leg accident took Alice off the road, and
she began organizing handoffs from a hotel room in Atlanta. Having her as a broker was quickly decided
to be a crucial improvement to their partnership.

Today, Alice uses ShipChain to manage her associates’ hauls. She can oversee all the drivers in her co-
op, match new work to the best available drivers, and she always has access to compliance and regula-
tory paperwork whenever necessary. Everybody knows where they’re going and what they are hauling.

If there's a problem with a driver, or they need to schedule time off, Alice can find supplemental trusted
drivers in the ShipChain marketplace to fill in the gaps or take over a route. Even better, Alice is now
able to identify problems in the team by insights into historical data, and can help encourage everyone
to drive safer and slower, not only to extend their lifespan but also to maximize profitability from the
ShipChain Safe Driving Rewards.

The Clever Mega-Broker

Box2U is one of the leading European shipping brokers, they deal with hundreds of carriers that man-
age thousands of drivers, delivering millions of containers (worth billions of dollars) each year. Aware
of shrinking margins, obligations to customers demanding faster and cheaper deliveries, and the prob-
lems inherent with the tracking systems used by many of their partners, Box2U began development on
an advanced Web 2.0 platform for shippers to keep better track of their assets. The bad news? They
started building it 4 years ago, and today the system is only barely ready to use. Drivers and carriers
aren't voluntarily submitting accurate data, and the whole project seems like a dead end and sunk cost.

Box2U knows it is not a software company. After sinking millions of dollars into a problem that is rap-
idly proving to be out-of-scope for their business model, management notices a use-case just like this
described on the ShipChain website. The ShipChain API is a fast, cheap and secure ledger for storing
all their shipment data, plus trustless escrow contracts and ELD integrations — it's everything Box2U has
been trying to build and more. Since the whole system is built using blockchain technology in a free
and open manner, even a competitor like Box2U is able leverage ShipChain technologies to power their
own branded interface for managing freight.

FUNDING & BUDGET

We are committed to spending our funding responsibly. Below are our plans for properly allocating
the assets to deliver the best possible solutions, as quickly as possible. We are limiting the total con-
tributions in the crowdfunding to $30 million USD because we feel taking more money would not be
responsible and wouldn't lead to a better product any faster. Below is a preview of our best estimates
of what we'll do with any money we raise in the TGE.

Research and Development
ShipChain will be at the cutting edge of blockchain technology, including a full development team for
Solidity, as well as our web platform for UI/UX, Frontend, and Backend. We will also bring on hardware
and loT developers to further advance the amount of data that can be tracked. Research into sidechain
tech will be done, and the team will consider the acquisition of an existing logistics/trucking company in

order to accelerate both the physical development and adoption of the platform.

Operations

Operations and development teams will begin within the United States, but also to support the Perdue
pilot program, South America, as well as Asia and Europe to further partner with additional carriers.
Support teams to operate hardware and troubleshoot issues will be necessary, and field integrations
with legacy systems. Cloud and server infrastructure will be necessary with the web platform.

Marketing Strategy

The ShipChain Foundation is forming alliances in the logistics space with large corporations, small busi-
nesses, freight companies, truckers, brand evangelists and other partners, much like the Enterprise
Ethereum Alliance did for Ethereum and corporate partnerships. This initiative is an important piece of
our strategy, not only from a marketing perspective, but to bolster widespread support of the ecosystem
we're building. In the coming months, ShipChain will announce partnerships that will support this effort.

ShipChain’s core team and advisors have a combined century of experience in marketing and public
relations, many with decades of history advertising for large brands and social media influencers. The
team is uniquely equipped, both directly and through relationships, to execute marketing campaigns
that will spread our message and secure our brand as a dominant player in the shipping space. Ship-
Chain will advertise on relevant platforms to reach the right people in the shipping and logistics industry.

We will handle P.R. and communications both internally and via 3rd parties, keeping our community
constantly updated about developments, initiatives, and new relationships. Our communications strat-
egy consists of press and marketing, but also community engagement through our core team.

Business Development

We will attend both US-based and international conferences to build our network and find new leads.
We'll focus more on private 1-on-1 development with US transportation firms. ShipChain will host edu-
cational evenings in different cities to attract local business owners and invite them to join our platform.

We will also focus on finding strategic partners internationally, both on a corporate and a political level
for quicker implementation and mass adoption. We will have team members on both coasts of the U.S.

To maximize our business development on top of all other efforts, we will also hire at least one team
member in Europe to cover a larger geographical area. The team will be able to cover conferences all
over the world, meet with more potential strategic partners and customers, and build more relation-
ships.

Legal
Legal is an important aspect for ShipChain. We will retain outside counsel with extensive experience in
the transportation industry to begin developing framework for best practices and compliance.

Expanding ShipChain Intellectual Property portfolio as well as the acquisition of key technologies is
pivotal. We will retain counsel for Food Safety and Modernization Act review and create proposals for
approaching key partners in the industry. We will work with strategic partners to encourage government
and administrative bodies to utilize the platform for Proof of Concept testing.

Retaining key personnel to work with the Food and Drug Administration to encourage adoption of
blockchain technology is an additional step we will take. We will also continue to develop strategic part-
nerships with domestic and international partners to help with the proliferation of the platform at both
the government and corporate level.

Eventually, we will hire a dedicated lobbyist to encourage adoption of the platform as the industry
standard and overall proliferation of blockchain. We will develop additional license agreements for the
platform as well.

REVENUE MODEL

ShipChain will employ a two-fold revenue model, focusing on both the Small and Mid-size Business
market (SMB), as well as Enterprise platform development. This includes the following:

ShipChain Web

ShipChain’s web platform will enable shippers to connect directly to carriers, without the traditional bro-
kerage model. Fees will be a low percentage of the cost of shipping, and ShipChain will avoid having
to hire typical telemarketing brokers, keeping the cost of selling at a minimum. This base percentage
fee will be the primary income source for ShipChain Web, followed by partnerships for Cargo Insurance,
as well as partner value-add services upsold on top of shipments. With a transparent fee system, Ship-
Chain will show shippers the actual cost from the carrier, and how much they save versus the traditional
brokerage model. Instant booking will be done, versus the traditional 3-4 day wait period.

ShipChain Enterprise

ShipChain will also develop custom sidechain solutions for large enterprises that need to utilize different
data sources and information. ShipChain will do this as a development contractor, with all new side-
chains still tying into the main blockchain. This will be custom quoted per client, but will be on the scale
of large ERP implementations that routinely run over seven figures.

FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS

Self-Driving Vehicles

The self-driving revolution is coming, and ShipChain will be prepared for it. Currently, drivers facilitate
the handoff and delivery of loads, allowing for a carrier-level security verification at each event. We
propose a novel method for preventing cargo theft or mishandling is a combination of RFID tagging,
2D barcoding, plus cargo trailer sensors that communicate with the blockchain. The unauthorized un-
loading of cargo by receivers will be noted and combined with the geographical data. This information
will be publicly verifiable. This method holds receiving and shipping parties accountable for any mis-
handled, lost or stolen goods.

Transparency

ShipChain plans to significantly increase the level of transparency in the blockchain space. With com-
munity managers working with supporters in public chat and forums, our team also plans to release
scheduled quarterly progress reports detailing software development progress, as well as progress on
all plans detailed in this whitepaper. These quarterly progress reports will be scheduled after the initial
token sale, and include statements from the development team, statements from the operations team,
executive overviews, updated timetables, and other pertinent information to the progress of the Ship-
Chain project.

Support of a Common Goal

ShipChain plans to support and encourage a better environmental policy in the freight industry. We
strongly support a shift away from heavy polluting “bunker fuel” in sea freight to cleaner natural gas
or even electric container ships, the encouragement of freight rail for its high efficiency, the use of fuel
economy improving technology and gamification of fuel efficiency in the trucking industry, and the use
of Al to reduce fuel usage. Protecting our environment is critical, and the freight industry should con-
stantly work to improve its carbon footprint.

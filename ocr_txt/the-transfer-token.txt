Feature No. 2 Lending

Eternal Wallet provides users with the world’ s highest received amount during
currency exchanges, but to make this possible there is a necessity to have users who
will lend out TTT into Eternal Wallet’ s Pool.

Users who lend out TTT into the Pool, upon the currency exchange being successfully
processed, will be able to receive a partial amount of the fees which the user who
exchanged currency paid.

(The fees received will fluctuate according to the foreign currency balance within the
Pool)

Feature No. 3 Transfer

TTT can be transferred to outside wallets and cryptocurrency exchanges where TTT is
listed. However, between Eternal Wallet users, transfers can be made at a lower fee of

the equivalent of 5 cents (USD).

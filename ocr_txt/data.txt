Abstract

Forrester Report recently published a study titled "Mobile
Fraud: Marketers' Massive Hidden Threat". It is a profound
and alarming reflection from the digital marketing and
advertising industry to look inside of the beast that has
been fed by the industry itself and grown in pace with the
latter. This beast is no longer easily containable as the
speed of mobile device penetrating in every aspect of our
daily life is heightened and our appetite is bigger and
hungrier for better quality of content and information of the
goods we want to consume.

One of the most overwhelming challenges
in the digital advertising industry is the
abundance of fraudulent data flowing into

the entire network, commonly termed as
“Ad fraud”.

Currently, more than 40% of digital ad traffic is
generated by automated bots which have defrauded
advertisers in billions of US dollars annually [29]. Such
fraudulent performance marketing deteriorates
efficiency of the whole industry, and results in
exorbitant costs for advertisers and thereby cuts into

the actual revenue for legitimate publishers. Ad fraud is

more of a systematic problem. As the digital marketing

and advertising ecosystem becomes more and more

complex, the middle layers between advertisers and
publishers also swell into multiple stacks. Although the
pattern of fraud traffic can be detected, gradually more
and more by the evolving machine learning
technologies, the ever deeper origin or the source is
hardly traceable because of the multi-stacked middle
layers that typically excel in extremely complex
redistribution, routing and redirecting. Such complexity

inevitably has itself invigorated a new set of problems

into the digital advertising ecosystem, such as “walled
garden” and “data isolation”, etc. The entire AdTech
industry is constantly facing the prisoner's dilemma in
that while data sharing globally would maximize the
overall performance and effect, yet the optimal
strategy for individual user is to keep the behavioral
data exclusive locally on the device, be it a PC or
mobile. The reason for such dilemma is due to lack of
strong incentive to encourage data sharing, and
inability to deliver actual value of such incentive if and
when it's available. Autonomous, fair and transparent
governance, while simply self-contradictory in a
centralized environment, constitutes main thesis in a
decentralized and consensus based infrastructure,

especially with the blockchain technology.

"We are entering a new era, where people
expect the value of the services and
communities they create is shared with
them......Blockchain tokens offer a new way
of sharing that perceived value of the

community to its members."

Since monetization relying on advertising has
contributed to large share of revenue stream for most
internet companies, the current model developed in the
past decades has been built on a centralized economy
by gauging end user's attention to the ads for better
targeting. The demand for user attention has been
rising as the competition gets tougher and push for
volume number of users becomes a tug of war for the
gain and for the survival of Internet companies. The

stake is so high and the gain is lucrative, thus created

loopholes for the birth of fraud data with fake users,
installs and fake activation, etc. that continues to flood
the entire communication network. Many advanced

fraud detection technologies have been developed to

tackle the problems, but most of them focused on the
after-fact detection and then to analyze patterns of the
data to determine the validity of end user if it even

exists.

The technology needs to be able to build into
preventing the fraud being propagated into the
network traffic flow. The data of the user's attention
patterns need be logged and encrypted to be
distributed over a decentralized P2P protocol in order
to deliver the heightened security with consensus from

the community auto-programmatically. Thus it can be

validated any time, while stored across the network

and shared in real-time.

Applying the blockchain technology and the Artificial
Intelligence plowing on deep learning is the foundation
technology that can set the standard to ensure the
decentralization of the least risky information data
flow and storage requirement, where every player in
the community or the ecosystem becomes the ultimate

winner.

Introduction

DATA is a blockchain project initiated and governed by Blockchain Data Foundation Limited
(“Blockchain Data Foundation”, or BDF from hereafter), a company limited by guarantee to be
incorporated in Singapore and governed in a not-for-profit manner. This project is being developed in
collaboration with Yomob International Co., Ltd. mob”), a mobile monetization-as-a-service

company.

The DATA project is devised to address the root of the fraud at its core. To ensure that every participant in the

ecosystem is motivated to "do good", the DATA platform applies a reward system to incentivize end users with

their attention contribution and to publishers with pruning their sell-side inventory. More

granular information is

collected and privately encrypted into a built-in peer-to-peer data storage for sharing across the network. Because

every user is made aware of varying rewards only appropriate for his/her attention consumed on ads served in

games or apps, it is highly catered and more personal. Therefore a user is less inclined to reject, ignore or block

advertising. The experience institutes a more intimate relation between the advertisement and its consumer.

On top of that, advertisement consumption, no matter what format, be it banner or interstitial or a video or a

playable advertisement, is tracked at the device level. Besides being the base for the hugely beneficial rewarding

for the true user, the analysis of the behavioral data allows the subsequent conclusion o

person or a fake bot.

The DATA project's most innovative edge is to proactively identify the fraudulence based

analysis via our proprietary Al algorithm, prior to the fraudulent user data being injected

whether the user is a real

on the pattern or behavior

into the entire network.

Such preventive measurement is the other side of the coin where reward is granted to a true user for his/her

attention consuming the advertisements and to the associated device contributing to in

he P2P storage sharing.

The DATA platform and its token, DATA Token (DTA) will serve as the backbone of its blockchain based advertising

infrastructure. The system supports micropayment where tokens can be used across ap

plications, such as

purchasing virtual items and premium services, or for publishers- redeemed as currency in ad networks, DSPs

(Demand Side Platforms), ad exchanges, third-party SaaS (Software as a Service) service and etc.

1. Limitations of Centralized Internet Advertising Bureau

As Internet services derive their revenue from paid subscriptions or advertisements, the latter has been proven to be
taking a much larger share behind the duopoly, namely Google and Facebook. Digital advertising is fundamentally
a targeted delivery of marketing message, and measurement of whether and how such messages are consumed.
When the end users spend their attention to consume services of their choice, the publishers/service providers/
media/developers manage to gather user attention data for analysis and reporting, in order to index any errors and

to refine future precision in targeting.

Figure 1. Mobile Internet Ad Spending Worldwide, 2015-2020 [1]

With the rising of mobile era, digital advertising has been drastically shifted to formulate mobile centric strategy.
According to [1], mobile advertising now accounts for 68.5% of total global digital advertising expenditure and the

trend is only going upward.

Bad actors in the ecosystem have deliberately created alarming amounts of malvertisement that have been
extremely difficult to track and eliminate. Along that line, there is also high risk of user's personal data being

exposed to unknown and unaccountable layers of intermediaries.

To police the network, IAB (Interactive Advertising Bureau) was created to govern the industry's standard fraud

reporting by way of blacklist and whitelist of malicious nodes, like Ads.txt[10]. Despite their good intentions and

tremendous effort put in to serve the industry as it has been, these centralized reports are facing enormous

challenge:

Blockchain Data Foundation | 7
DECENTRALIZED Al-POWERED TRUST ALLIANCE

DATA INTEGRITY

These lists are centrally managed and
organized. It is reasonable to challenge
that the lists may be compromised due
to single threaded programmatic

mistakes or human errors.

TRANSPARENCY

Almost acted as a block box operation,
there has not been much detail shared as
to the ranking and measurement process
over the data it collected and dissected,
or whether the 3rd party authentication
is certified. Lack of transparency opens

windows for prolific fraud activities.

2. Severe Ad Fraud

REAL-TIME PRECISION

With the real time dynamics
occurring in every micro second
in the ad trading, bidding and
delivering, these lists quickly
became out of date and therefore
lack accuracy in a timely manner
to reflect the fast changing of all
the actors involved. For example,
a benign publisher may introduce
bot traffic after it is put into the
whitelist, making it unpredictable
and almost unpreventable in the

real time manner.

MONOPOLY OF DATA

It lacks check and balance.
Out-of-date technology is
overwhelmed with the ever
increasing volume of
information it must process
and index to provide the
guidance through the black-
and white-list. The reporting
cannot be as fast as the
fraud being generated and
propagated in the internet
speed, as a consequence it
perpetuates the Mouse-and-

Cat game.

According to [6], intermediaries take more than half of advertising revenues. For example, if an advertiser's budget

is $100, less than $50 goes to the end publisher while intermediaries take more than $50.

Primarily ad ecosystems are primarily composed of advertisers, publishers and users. Advertisers budgeted their
marketing expenditure and let known of the target and expected KPI to publishers who own various networks
directly or indirectly that can reach to the end users. Creative of an ad campaign would be eventually displayed to
he end users in order to gain their attention. To bridge enormous upstream demand of ads serving with
downstream supply of user reach, the mid-tier services have evolved to broker the matching, each to differentiate
by offering more value-added services. The programmatic I/O has inevitably emerged in all levels to facilitate and

ulfill the appetite of the global marketing needs, and driven by speedier and wider spread of the mobile devices.

These mid-tier services include demand side platform (DSP), ad exchanges (ADX), ad networks (ADN), supply side

platform (SSP), data vendor, ad attribution, analytical and reporting tools, optimization, trading desks, agencies etc.

Along with these services evolved to tackle a number of general or specific issues in the daily transaction of
unthinkable volume of ad trading, the scale of complexity and cost also skyrocketed. The increasing complexity with
its resulting negative impact on the health of the ecosystem, prompts the industry to search for better solutions.
Looking deeper into the formation of the complexity, one could identify several issues, namely the insolation of

information and limited sharing of data.

Service providers typically offer programmatic interfaces such as APIs (Application Programming Interface) or SDKs
(Software Development Kit) to facilitate functions or features as well as certain data exchange. Fundamentally
every actor desires data, but inherently every one also guards certain data as part of its own purpose of mining the
data, thereby between parties, there exists "Walled garden". Understandably, owning deeper level and extra
amount of user data adds to the competitive edge over the rivalry’s, it is at the same time, exactly this mentality
that fosters the warm bed of volume amount of fraud by bad actors for lucrative gains. True end user is becoming a

pawn in the game without even being aware of it.

Currently some of the ad fraud prevention service providers such as TUNE or Appsflyer would track converted user
data from the advertiser’s promoting apps as well as data provided by ADNs and DSPs. Such solution is as
passive as an after-fact by identifying the fraud actors. So far such solution has not been able to prevent the fraud
from being deliberately leaked into the ad marketplace. The critical challenge of the current state of ad fraud
prevention methodology is the ability to track down the original source of fraud downstream instead of just

detecting the fraud occurrence based on the data collected from upstream.

3. Rewarding User's Attention on Ads Consumption

The ultimate source of all the advertisement income is user attention. A common Internet business model is users
get free access to digital services, content and information, like news or media websites and App's, Facebook,
Instagram, blogs, etc. While users contribute their attention by viewing the advertisements, the service providers

then collect advertisement revenue. This business model had been worked well, but the landscape changed as the

DECENTRALIZED Al-POWERED TRUST ALLIANCE

mobile Internet develops. First, publishers try to get advertisement revenue more and more aggressively, they

exhaustively collect users' personal data, draw the user profiles, try their hardest to insert more ads into the original

contents (and in a more ambiguous, ha

rdly distinguishable way), and build extremely sophisticated models just

trying to make users click more ads. In the end, user privacy is placed into jeopardy but they got less and less

valuable original content. In addition, next generation mobile ads, such as video advisement, interactive

advertisement, playable advertisement, Augmented Reality advertisements, are consuming increasing amount of

users’ attention. More and more users started to employ ads blocking tools and technologies, according to [8], more

than 600 million mobile and desktop devices now use ad blocking. They are downloading ad-blocking tools on their

mobile devices and this number is growing rapidly. The relationship between publishers and users are no longer

win-win, but a combat. The problem to

Figure 3. Devices Using Adblock Software on Open Web [8]

With the emergence of mobile ad technology, the value exchange based mobile ads model become very popular

among certain mobile ad verticals such

as rewarded video ads adopted by lots of mobile games. It is a great

balance between user experience and ad monetization. For instance, game player gets some special in-app reward

for viewing a video ad, such as Piano Tile 2 from Cheetah Mobile [24]. Also, users can view an ad to get offline

rewards such as coupons. These are good initiatives to reward users for their attention contribution. However, these

kinds of value exchange based ads have several limitations:

a) They are only feasible for specific type of mobile application publishers;

b) They may deliver benefits that's not

needed by the users;

c) They frequently come with more distractive content that bothered users;

Blockchain Data Foundation | 10
DECENTRALIZED Al-POWERED TRUST ALLIANCE &

d) Users’ attention have different opportunity costs given different applications and time they spend viewing the

advertisements. However, rewards nowadays are not tailored to the value of the individual user's attention.

To summarize, the time has come for users to be well and fairly rewarded for the attention they contribute, but in a

systematic, user-friendly, and widely adopted way.

4. The Solution: Blockchain Based Attention Reward to Prevent Ad Fraud

Technically, fraud traffic is not hard to detect as long as advertisement tracking data is authentic and available. But
the previously mentioned isolation and complexity in the middle layers make it extremely hard to gather all available
tracking data and trace back fraud traffic to its original sources. The “prisoners’ dilemma” as mentioned calls for a
out-of-the-box solution, some practical and effective incentives to make ads tracking data publicly shared and
available. The incentive needs to be conducted in a decentralized manner as no centralized entity in the online ads
industry is capable of handling this, or can be trusted by everyone else. Decentralized governance and incentive
distribution are just what blockchain is best at, therefore we have come up with DATA, the blockchain based cyber

advertising protocol for ad fraud prevention.

DATA is a blockchain based advertising protocol and technology stack. It consists of 4 layers: P2P Mobile Storage
Layer, Blockchain Layer, SDK Management Layer and Application Process Layer.

P2P MOBILE STORAGE LAYER SDK MANAGEMENT LAYER

The following chapters entitled "Competitive Landscape" is a rather extensive study on a few of the digital

advertising projects based on the state of the art blockchain technology. They are analyzed and compared with
DATA. In the chapter entitled "DATA Project Technology Design", the high level design of DATA illustrates its
technical core competency, followed by why Yomob is the perfect launch pad for DATA, and this Whitepaper will

end with introducing our key partners, team, advisors and the road map.

Competitive Landscape

As the blockchain technology has become more broadly adopted, few of its applications are aiming

to resolve the larger issues facing the digital advertising industry, namely the fraud, the numerous
intermediaries, and the centralized agency dictating the obsolete rules and the more indifference of

end users toward the ad serving.

Some of these blockchain application projects do try to focus on certain specific problems although in
a narrower sense. However, the level of feasibility or efficiency of them is the subject of this chapter

that we will analyze and make reasonable comparison.

1. Basic Attention Token (BAT) [3]

BAT is developed by the Brave browser team and is the pioneer in blockchain based attention rewarding. Users’ are

rewarded for their advertisement viewing time within the Brave browser with digital tokens; and these tokens can

be used in user applications as well as a currency in the advertiser - publisher - user business flow. BAT is limited

by the following factors:

CENTRALIZATION

It's a centrally managed
application token issued by the
Brave company. The tokens can
only be used within Brave
ecosystem, and not anywhere
else on the Internet. The
governance of the Brave
ecosystem is under the company’s
control, not the holders of the

tokens and end users.

EFFICIENCY

BAT is an ERC20 token on
Ethereum blockchain, therefore
the efficiency is subject to the
capacity of Ethereum. The
transaction latency of Ethereum,
which is typically several minutes
and the scalability of Ethereum,

which is around 10 transactions

per second on the whole network,

makes BAT tokens not feasible in

real-life applications like

micropayment or ad bidding.

DEPENDENCY

Dependence on the Ethereum
network not only introduces
efficiency problems, but also
easibility problems. Transactions
involving BAT tokens require
burning ETH as gas. For an
ordinary end user, who does not
possess ETH, or doesn’t have
nowledge of crypto tokens or the
Ethereum blockchain, this
presents a practical problem -

how can Brave company

persuade an end user to purchase

ETH from places like exchanges
and use it as currency to pay for

any desired BAT transactions?

Blockchain Data Foundation | 13
DECENTRALIZED Al-POWERED TRUST ALLIANCE

PRACTICABILITY

In BAT’s model, the advertisers need to buy tokens from exchanges and
pay them to publishers and users. This is not much different from current
money flow other than the fact that users receive a portion of tokens
immediately. It’s not made clear in BAT’s white paper whether this token
flow runs parallel with current money flow or will substitute current money
flow. In either case, it’s not practically or easily achievable to coach all
advertisers to buy BAT tokens as the currency in the advertisement flow.
Currently, BAT lacks the infrastructure to do so: they do not have a digital

ad exchange system on blockchain, and the performance of Ethereum

prevents them from building an effective system.

AD FRAUD

BAT does not present a solution to
ad fraud. To make matters worse,
it is vulnerable to fraud traffic. As
the token distribution is based on
a simple timestamp-based
formula, there is incentive for
fraudulent end users to create
fake traffic to get more tokens, like

those performed in clicking farms.

In contrast, DATA works perfectly in these scenarios. It is a set of blockchain based protocol and technology stack.

Being a standalone chain means the governance is managed by the community of all players in the ecosystem, and

the area of application is not restricted to any specific browser or application, but anyone who adopts the protocol.

Our technology stack, the P2P based mobile storage layer, Tendermint based consensus engine, as well as the

incorporation of state channels for micropayment makes the DATA blockchain highly performant and scalable.

Being a standalone chain means DATA does not have the “burn ETH for BAT transaction” problem.

In DATA, reward tokens are not purchased by the advertisers, but distributed by the system in a mining like process.

This enables the token flow to coexist with current money flow with the money flow unchanged. Since advertisers

need to do nothing different, the protocol is easy to get accepted and bootstrapped. In DATA, token distribution is

not based on a simple time-based model, but a more sophisticated reputation-based model. Having users’ activity

logs and reputation data available in the P2P mobile storage enables the system to effectively detect fraud while in

simultaneously as determining the reward distribution.

The project does not clarify many edge cases to make the system a really functional one in all scenarios.
These edge cases include how to handle unpopular sites and sparse voting, how to prevent attacks, what
the incentives for token holders are, and how to prevent legitimate publishers from becoming malicious after

they are classified into the whitelist.

To summarize, AdChain is a nice initiative to use smart contracts on Ethereum and crowd source of wisdom to build
publisher whitelist. However, the whitelist itself is not a holy grail for fraud prevention, as AdChain’s voting
mechanism is subject to attack, as its approach in relying on voters’ wisdom falsely underestimates the difficulty of

fraud detection for individual players, especially in absence of traceable data.

3. AdEx [5] and Papyrus [23]

The AdEx project aims at building a decentralize d ad exchange with Ethereum smart contracts. To support that,
the AdEx project contains a publisher portal, an advertiser protocol, an AdEx profile, and a publisher side AdEx SDK.
The publisher protocol is a client-side DApp used for publisher registration, registering websites/channels and
advertising properties, and most importantly for accepting particular bids. Likewise, advertiser protocol is a client-
side DApp used for advertiser registration, creating different campaigns and placing bids over advertising space.

The AdEx profile is a client-side DApp that allows user to change their preferences regarding advertising. AdEx SDK
is a HTML5 based publisher SDK for ads display and reporting to the blockchain.

Papyrus is a similar project to AdEx. It also builds a decentralized ad exchange solution, with different

decomposition from AdEx, but mostly the “d” counterparts of traditional digital ads players, like “dSSP”, “dDSP”,

“dDMP”, etc. Papyrus is also built on smart contracts but with integration of state channels, Papyrus enables real-

ime bidding following the “dRTB” protocol they propose.

AdEx and Papyrus present feasible smart contract based decentralized ad exchange solutions. AdEx’s focus is
direct bids for large conversion goals, instead of real-time bidding what Papyrus handles. However decentralized

ad exchange does not solve current pain points in the digital ads industry. It’s good to have if a lot of advertisers

and publishers already moved to the blockchain space, but it doesn't help solve current problems like fraud traffic,
ad blocking, lack of user incentive etc. Overall, we see AdEx and Papyrus as good trials into the blockchain space

with DApps, but they do not constitute the infrastructure of such a system. They can be nice complements to DATA

ecosystem, and we will look into the possible integration.

n order to prevent the message from broadcasting in the system and ensure the fully decentralization of the
system, DATA system leverages on the distributed Mobile Metadata Management system (M3 or M Cube) to
manage the node reputation value and evidences for blockchain. M3 uses distributed hash table (e.g. Chord[17] ,

ademlia[18]}) protocol to manage nodes in a distributed manager. Inspired by the IPFS system, M3 is targeting on

ightweight metadata management in mobile devices.

n DHT, every node only needs to maintain connections with O(log(n)) of nodes in the system. For a node query,
instead of

broadcasting the query messages to all the nodes, it only needs query O(log(n)) nodes. Figure 4.1 shows

hat as the number of nodes increase in the system, the number of nodes that need to be contacted is small.[28]

Figure 4.1 Scalability of the nodes

The DHT is widely used in IPFS[16], BitTorrent [19] to increase the scalability of the system. A number of open

source implementations of DHT are available on Github [26] as well. M3 is a mobile version of the DHT tailored for

blockchain metadata management of mobile devices. According to a survey from Pew Research Center [27], cell

owners under 50 rarely turn their phones off. Their mobile devices maintain a constant existence online that turns

into stable points in the internet to form a DHT as the churn is rather insignificant. To scale up the availability of

DHT, M3 also uses super nodes as part of DHT, which are the static VMs in the cloud maintained to provided high
availability and reliability. These static VMs are bootstrap nodes that if there is no mobile peers available in the

system, the storage layer is still functioning at these nodes. They also serve as NAT servers for mobile nodes for IP

Blockchain Data Foundation | 18
DECENTRALIZED Al-POWERED TRUST ALLIANCE &

address tracking if the cached IP in mobile nodes has expired. The super nodes are contributed by the community in

order to ensure the transparency of the system, which is similar to the miner machine.

Figure 4.1 shows an overview of the M3 overlay. M3 consists of two types of nodes: Super Node and Mobile Node. A
Mobile node does not necessarily have to be a mobile phone- it can be a laptop, desktop or any device that has
storage availability accessible via internet. A mobile node acts as a storage node until the device is shut down.
Both types of nodes will be awarded with tokens for the duration of time and the amount of storage each

contributes to the net.

'

Figure 4.2 DHT P2P Overlay

In the following sections, we will take Chord protocol as an example to elaborate how M3 leverages DHT for efficient

file storage and lookup. Basically, the M3is designed to do the following:

a) uploading evidence and reputation values generated and stored in the mobile storage in a distributed manner;

b) managing churns (i.e. length of time when a node joins and leaves the topology)

c) providing APIs for file look up.

In M3 protocol, each node has two operations for the file management:

(1) Store(key, val), which puts the file with its hash key into the DHT

Blockchain Data Foundation | 19
DECENTRALIZED Al-POWERED TRUST ALLIANCE &

(2) val = Retrieve(key), which retrieves the file based on the key

Unlike the broadcasting protocol that broadcasts the query to all the nodes in the topology, the store and retrieve
protocols can achieve O(log (n)) complexity, where n is the number of nodes in the system. To achieve this, each
node needs to manage a finger table. As shown in Figure 5, each node keeps a finger table containing up to m
entries, where m is the number of bits in the hash key. The ith entry of node n will contain successor

(n+2'!) mod 2”). The first entry of finger table is actually the node's immediate successor. Every time a node
wants to look up a key k, it will pass the query to the closest successor or predecessor (depending on the finger
able) of k in its finger table (the "largest" one on the circle whose ID is smaller than k, until a node finds out the key

is stored in its immediate successor. DHT is like a distributed skip list. Each time you go 1/2 way towards

he destination.

n order to further enhance the file availability, we use erasure code to encode the file chunks and distribute them in
he Chord. An erasure code is a forward error correction (FEC) code under the assumption of bit erasures (rather

han bit errors), which transforms a message of k symbols into a longer message (code word) with n symbols such

hat the original message can be recovered from a subset of the n symbols.

We will discuss more details on how M3 works in the following sections.

1.1 Mobile Node Join/Leave

For each node in the system, it must have a node id. We use SHA-1[21], which is a consistent hash function to

generate the node id based on the device id. The consistent hash function can ensure the hash collision probability

be extremely small. At beginning, all the super nodes will form a initial bootstrap DHT. When a node i joins the

DATA system for the first time, it generates a node id 1D; using the SHA-1 hash function. Then,

a) It contacts any bootstrap node n' (i.e., super nodes)

or its successor by using find_successor(n') as shown in

Figure 5.1. The super nodes will help the new join node to establish its finger table as shown in Figure 5.2. The

involve moving the data associated with each key to the new node. Node can become the successor only for

}

Figure 5.2 The pseudocode to init_finger tables of a new join node

When a node leaves the M3, the node sends a leaving message to all the nodes in the finger table and the
corresponding nodes will update their finger table. The leaving nodes will also transfer their responsible files to its

successor.

To ensure correct lookups, all successor pointers must be up to date. That is, a stabilization protocol as shown in
Figure 5.3 should be running periodically in the background. Each node i asks its successor for its predecessor. If the
predecessor is not itself and let says it is node p, it will contact the node p and set p as the successor. node p will
also set node i as predecessor.

When a node joins or leaves the network, the responsibility of at most O(K/N) keys changes hand (only to or from

the node that is joining or leaving. When the N is large, the impact of the key transfer is small.

x = successor.predecessor;

With high probability, any node joining or leaving, an N node Chord network will use O(log’) messages to re-

establish the Chord routing invariants and finger tables.

1.2 File Erasure Encoding

In order to increase the availability of the files in the DHT, we use erasure code to store redundant files in the DHT.

For a reputation evidence of size M, we split the log into k chunks, each of the same size M/k. Then we apply the
(n, k) code on these k chunks to get n chunks, each of the same size M/k. Now the effective size is n M/k. Thus the
file is expanded n/k times. We need to set n to be greater than or equal to k, so that n/k is at least 1. If n equals k,
you will have just split the file and there is no coding performed. Any k chunks out of the n chunks can be used to
retrieve the specific file. So this also means that the code can tolerate up to (n — k) erasures. Figure 6 shows an

example of a (4, 2) code.

re distributed into different nodes in the DHT. For example, if the file is (4, 2)

chunks to 4 different nodes in the DHT. If any two of the nodes are available in

DHT, the original file can be recovered.

1.3 File Store/Lookup

In DATA system, each node is preloaded with a set of hash functions with a certain order. The set of hash functions

will be used in File store and look up process.

After we generate the file chunks based on erasure coding, we need to publish the file chunks into the DATA

storage system. The file storing process consists of the following 4 steps:

Since we need to publish k ch

Figure 7. Example of Erasure Coding

The validator will send queries to the nodes in the DHT one by one until it receives k chunks so that it can reduce
the whole traffic in the DHT. The verifier recovers the original encrypted reputation logs and use node i's public key
to decrypt the logs. Then the verifier needs to run the reputation model based on the behavior log to verify if the

reported reputation value is corrected or not.

1.4 File Logging

Since we need to prevent the local user to change the activity logs, those logs are encrypted with owner's private
key. Any changes on the file will prevent the file being decrypted. Similar to the Kafka logging system, the file in M>
is append only. Every file chuck has an expiration date in order to keep the disk usage of the mobile device as small

as possible.

The distributed P2P based mobile storage M3 can be separated out from the DATA system as an independent
decentralized file system solution. It can serve as a mobile centric data storage solution to support mobile based
blockchain applications for content delivery purpose. Also the mobile devices in the storage system can be mobile

phone, mobile PC, tablet and so on.

1.5 Comparison with the IPFS[16].

The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a peer-to-peer distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing
devices with the same system of files. IPFS could be seen as a single BitTorrent swarm, exchanging objects within
one Git repository consists of a distributed hash table, an incentivized block exchange, and a self-certifying
namespace. M3 shares some similarities with the IPFS that tries to offer a decentralized services based ona

distributed hash table. The unique features of DATA system includes:

Blockchain Data Foundation | 25
DECENTRALIZED Al-POWERED TRUST ALLIANCE &

a) Unlike IPFS that treats all the nodes the same, M3 is designed with super nodes and peer nodes to deal with

unique challenges in the mobile storage environments.

b) Unlike IPFS that heavily use GIT to manage file versions which is unnecessarily heavy in the mobile

environments, M3 uses append only log similar to the Apache Kafka[25], which is super light weight.

c) Unlike IPFS uses BitTorrent protocol to coordinate networks of untrusting peers (swarms) to cooperate in

distributing pieces of files to each other, which is too heavy to the mobile environment, M3 is leveraging

awarding tokens and Al based reputation management system to encourage the node cooperation.

d

M3 further uses ensure code to better enhance the file distribution efficiency, which is missing in IPFS.

e) In M3, the user identity is presented as a one-way hashed value, which can protect the user privacy. Meanwhile,
the file chunks stored in each node are append only and are encrypted with private keys with a salt value. The

security of the file can be protected in the mobile storage level as well.

In general, M3 is tailored for lightweight metadata storage with high mobility, security, trustworthy, privacy and
efficiency. M3 not only can support DATA use case, but also can serve as a fundamental layer and service for other

suitable scenarios for metadata storage in the whole blockchain community.

2. Blockchain Layer

2.1 Consensus Engine

DATA Chain is built on top of Tendermint [11] Consensus Engine, which is very well suited for scaling delegated
proof-of-stake (DPoS) blockchains. More specifically, we're going to build DATA from a forked code base of
EtherMint [12], which is a high speed implementation of Ethereum on top of Tendermint. Tendermint is chosen

because of its system sophistication and availability:

a) It offers Byzantine Fault Tolerant DPoS consensus. Byzantine fault tolerant means the network is able to tolerate
up to 1/3 of nodes being malicious. DPoS is the advancing target of blockchain technology, as it's more energy
efficient. Individual validators (like miners in PoW systems) in DPoS systems are strongly incentivized against

acting malicious.

zs

Tendermint sits at the consensus layer and provides a set of ABCI (Application Blockchain Interface) for
developers to build customized blockchain solutions on top of it. This kind of layered architecture is very

developer friendly to us.

Blockchain Data Foundation | 26
DECENTRALIZED Al-POWERED TRUST ALLIANCE &

c) Tendermint is much faster and more scalable than Bitcoin and Ethereum because of its DPoS engine. In a POW
system, users typically wait for a few confirmations (around 6) to conclude that the transaction is “final”.
Therefore, it takes about 60 minutes for Bitcoin and 2 minutes for Ethereum to mark the finality of a transaction.
Throughput wise, Bitcoin only allows for about 3 transactions per second and Ethereum allows for about 10
transactions, whereas Tendermint reliably supports 10,000 transactions per second at 1 second latency. The

numbers make Tendermint a very favorable system choice.

2.2 Proof of Attention (PoA) based Token Reward

In DPoS systems, validators (like miners in PoW systems) need to be rewarded for their contribution to the network.

In DATA, users and publishers get most of the reward for their attention and data contribution.

Tokens are to be distributed as following manner:

Initial Launch:
The token supply of DATA Tokens (DTA) at initial launch will not exceed 12 billion tokens, out of which no more than
40% will be sold to Token investors, and the rest belongs to team, advisors, and Blockchain Data Foundation,

subject to vesting terms.

PoA Mining-like Process:
The same amount of tokens as the supply at initial launch will be distributed as Attention Reward in the mining-like

process with the following allocation:

(1) 10% to validator nodes in the system
(2) 20% to publishers
(3) 70% to end users

Each relevant contributor is properly incentivized according to the following principles:
e Rewards for users and publishers are issued on a daily basis and follow this “Proof of Attention” (PoA) rules.
e Users daily rewards depends on its attention contribution represented by its reputation determined by
validators.

e Rewards for validators are issued on each block creation following DPoS rules.

The attention reward distribution amount has a halving schedule similar to that of Bitcoins (e.g. halving about every

4 years). And when the newly minted amount diminishes, we expect DATA and DATA Tokens to become industry

protocol and widely accepted. That is the time when advertisers start to purchase DTA as the currency in the ad

Blockchain Data Foundation | 27
DECENTRALIZED Al-POWERED TRUST ALLIANCE &

flow, and the token flow gradually substitutes current money flow in the digital ads ecosystem. The DTA currency
represents the real value of the opportunity cost of user attention, which is highly relevant to the user acquisition
cost. Given that the aggregate market value of Internet is continuously growing while the total cyber attention of
humankind is limited to the entire population on the Internet, theoretically the value of DTA will keep increasing

with the time being.

2.3 State Channels

Canonical blockchains are limited to their scalability due to the decentralized nature of transactions: each
transaction needs to be processed every single network node. Current blockchain latency and throughput cannot
even satisfy the need for currency transactions, not to mention the need for massive digital advertising transaction:

clicking and displays, and real-time bidding; they are both orders magnitude more than currency transactions.

To scale blockchains, the blockchain community has studied three directions: larger blocks, sharding and state

Having studied three directions for scaling, we had decided that state channel is a more favorable choice. Therefore

we will implement similar technologies like Raiden Networks in DATA.

2.4 Smart Contracts

Building based on Ethermint means DATA has natural support for Ethereum virtual machines and smart contracts.
We will develop smart contract APIs to interact with the P2P mobile storage and the state channels network. That
makes smart contracts on DATA more powerful, and makes DATA one of most advanced and full fledged

blockchain stacks for various kinds of online advertising applications, or even applications in other areas.

3. SDK Management Layer

3.1 Open Source SDK

Since we treat SDK as an Oracle to manage the P2P storage system and the reputation of a user, we will release
the frontend SDK as an open-source project maintained by DATA community so that the public can audit the

credibility of the algorithms and the code. The mobile SDK has the following functionalities:

a) Provide application level services such as ad fraud prevention service for ad networks and DSPs and etc. We

will discuss details in Section 4;
b) Al based reputation modeling to determine the reputation value of a user based on the activities logs;

c) P2P mobile metadata storage managements

3.2 Game theory based Incentive Modeling

Game theory is a theory of applied mathematics that models and analyzes interactive decision situations. Based on
whether the players make binding agreements in the game, game theory models can be classified into cooperative
game models and non-cooperative game models. In the former, the players act based on their binding agreements.
In the latter, the players are self-enforcing entities (i.e., nodes can change their strategies at any time to maximize

their benefits).

We use WV = {1,2,...,2} to denote the set of all mobile nodes (i.e., game players) in the system. We use A; to denote
the action set for node i, and A; = {J, C}; the C (i.e., cooperative) action means the node will not hack the system,
while the J (i.e., incooperative, non-cooperative) action means it hacks the system and be malicious. The action

chosen by node i is denoted by a;, and the actions chosen by other nodes are denoted by an action set:

a_j = (dy, 47, 43,...a;_1, null, dj,1,..-,d,} -

Blockchain Data Foundation | 29
DECENTRALIZED Al-POWERED TRUST ALLIANCE &

a = (a;,a_;) = (dy, dp, d3,...j_1, js 4j4,---,4,} denotes the action set of all the nodes in the system when
report reputations. We use D to denote the Cartesian product of the action set of a node, use U;(a;, a_;) to denote

the utility (i.e., payoff, benefit) function of a node i given the strategies used by other nodes and use (U(a)) to

denote the sum of the utilities of all nodes. The game theory model for the system is denoted as: given a normal
form of game G, G = < W, D, U,(a;,a_;) > . Every rational node in the system intends to choose an action that
maximizes its utility for a given action tuple of the other nodes. That is, the best action a}* € A; is the

best response of node i to a_, iff for all other a; € A;, U,(a*,a_;) > U,(a;,a_;) .

Definition 1. A Nash Equilibrium (NE) is an action tuple that corresponds to the mutual best response. Formally,
the action tuple a* = (aj‘, a#,a¥, ...,a*) is a NE if U,(a*,a*;) > Uj(a;,a*,) for Va; € A; and Vi € W, where A;

denotes the action set (cooperative, non-cooperative) for node i.
Therefore, a NE is an action set where no individual rational node can benefit from unilateral deviation.
Definition 2. An outcome of a game is non-Pareto-optimal if there is another outcome which would give all

players higher payoffs, or would give partial players the same payoff but the other players a higher payoff. An

outcome is Pareto-optimal if there are no other such outcomes.

Therefore, the ultimate goal of the non-cooperative model is to make the cooperation behavior as both Nash

equilibrium and Pareto-Optimal.

In DATA system, three kinds of nodes will be awarded: DATA nodes, infrastructure contributing nodes and user
attention contributing nodes. Those cooperative nodes will be awarded with tokens to increase their incentives. The
malicious nodes will be punished by putting them into the blacklist. The awards/punishments that we are designed

will guarantee the cooperative behaviors are both Nash Equilibriums and Pareto-Optimal.

3.3 Reputation Management

DATA SDK leverages Artificial Intelligence (Al) to calculate the reputation of the users, which reflects the
rustworthiness of the users. DATA also evaluate advertisers’ reliability based on the collaborated rating from peers.
n order to ensure the peer consensus for the reputation value, the rating and activities are encrypted with private
ey of owners and put them into blockchains. The Al model is published with the SDK so that the peers can use the
model to verify the reputation value based on the activity logs. The reputation models can be easily extended to

other scenarios such as online retail, online banking and cyberbully and etc. for reputation management to prevent

raud. The sections below will give the details of the reputation management.

Blockchain Data Foundation | 30
DECENTRALIZED Al-POWERED TRUST ALLIANCE &

3.3.1 Publisher Reputation Modeling

In order to distinguish the malicious users and cooperative nodes and give a evaluation of the quality of the user,
we are using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) [20] to learn the historical malicious nodes and cooperative nodes
based on the historical logs. The model is trained offline based on TensorFlow[22] and is supplied with the SDK so

that the user that uses SDK can use the same model to calculate/verify the reputation values.

An LSTM block is composed of four main components: a cell, an input gate, an output gate and a forget gate. The
cell is responsible for "remembering" values over arbitrary time intervals; hence the word "memory" in LSTM. Each
of the three gates can be thought of as a "conventional" artificial neuron, as in a multi-layer (or feedforward) neural
network: that is, they compute an activation (using an activation function) of a weighted sum. Intuitively, they can
be thought of as regulators of the flow of values that goes through the connections of the LSTM; hence the
denotation "gate". There are connections between these gates and the cell. Some of the connections are recurrent,

some of them are not.

Figure 8. LSTM Cell

The SDK layer will track the click activities of users before/during/after viewing advertisement. Since this activity
data is time-series data, we use a sliding window of size N across the data to generate training sets. The basic
sliding window size is 1 day. Each sliding window is labelled with a reputation value scale from 0 to | with 0.1 for
each step. 0 indicates the malicious nodes and lindicates the dedicated attention contributor. The value in between
indicates the different level of attention each user has put into the model. Those time series activity data will encode
the information such as the number of user views a day and the length of time a video advertisement is viewed for.
It can also encode whether the user has clicked on the advertisement. Together with these time series activity data,

the inputs of the model also include device type (e.g. iOS, Android, AR device), App type (e.g. Game App, Social App

and etc.), location (e.g. Beijing, New York) and so on. All these advertisement related features are fused into the

model to measure the quality of a user in a multiple-dimensional way.

The LSTM's training model looks like the figure below. The time-series training sets are the normalized users click
logs, which are the inputs of the model. The outputs of the model are the reputation values. The reputation values

are calculated based on SoftMax functions.

The trained model is loaded into the SDK Management Layer. In the SDK layer, we will calculate the reputation
value within a monthly moving window. That is, the user must accumulate 1 month's worth of click logs before get
a reputation value based on the LSTM model. Section 3.3.3 will discuss why we need to have a one month's worth
activity log. When calculating a reputation, a user creates a feature vector including a week's worth of activity logs,
location, device type, app category. The input vector is supplied into the model which then calculates the reputation

value of the user based on the inputs.
The click log and the associated reputation value will be transferred into the distributed mobile storage and
blockchains. When a user tries to verify the reputation value, it will find the activity log of the user and use the same

model to generate the reputation value of a user.

3.3.2 Advertiser Reputation Modeling

In order to prevent advertiser/ad networks from supplying malicious advertisements to the publishers, each viewer
in the system can assign a like/unlike rating of the advertisements based on advertisement user experiments. If the
advertisement is malicious, the SDK also supplies a API to report the malicious behaviors. All these ratings and
malicious reporting will be stored in the distributed mobile storage and reported to the blockchain. The reputation of

an advertiser j is a weighted sum of the rating from different users i as:

R= YR Win,
1

where R; is the rating of user i and W; is the reputation of user i. That is, we will give more rating weights to the

nodes with high reputation values.

3.3.3 Attack Analysis on Malicious Nodes

Since DATA system use an oracle to calculate the reputation value of a user based on the activity logs, we need to
prevent or reduce the impacts of malicious nodes if they fake their activity logs and transmit them into the
blockchains. First, we grant user tokens only when they generate 1 month's worth of valid activity log. The Al model
will validate the activity log. This policy can ensure that the malicious nodes are unable to generate a bunch of
device ids and changing them repeatedly. Secondly, before granting the tokens to the users, Blockchain Data
Foundation can check the activity data with the advertiser’s data management platform (DMP) data to ensure

hese activities are actually valid. We will also encourage advertisers to put their observed user click data into the

blockchain to automate the verification process.

4. Application Process Layer

The built-in application of DATA is fraud detection. Since it supports EVM and smart contracts, all applications
available on Ethereum are also available on DATA. As it supports state channel based micropayments, DATA
Tokens can be used as digital currency in scenarios broader than Bitcoins and Ethereum, like premium content

purchasing, online gifting, real-time bidding etc. Here we describe a few.

4.1 Fraud Prevention

The Fraud Prevention in DATA System is achieved through 3 ways.

a) Reputation Management. As discussed in Section 3.3, based on the Al models, both advertiser and publisher are
rated with a reputation value, which reflects their trustworthiness. The Al models can detect the malicious nodes
with suspicious long term activities and punish them. The peers can rate the advertisers to collaboratively

identify malicious advertisers and blacklist them.

zs

Blockchain. Since the activity logs can be accessed in the blockchain consensus layer, users and advertisers can

verify the reputation of each other anytime, everywhere, with high transparency.

a

Reward and Punish Incentives. The DATA Tokens together with the punishments can provide high incentives to

users in the system to be cooperative.

4.2 Micropayment for User Application

We will build desktop and mobile wallets for DATA. The wallet software will automatically determine the assigned
address based on device ID. We will also release SDK too to integrate the wallet into third party applications. As
DATA supports lightening fast micropayment, DTA can be used in all places where fiat currency can be used online,
for instance, purchasing virtual goods, premium content, online subscription, online gifting, etc. Figure [11] illustrates

mock ups of DATA wallets and example applications.

4.3 Decentralized Ad Exchange

As discussed previously, we'll look into porting of existing smart contracts based decentralized ad exchange

solutions, like AdEx [5] and Papyrus [23] into DATA. The DATA infrastructure naturally supports that.

applications.

DATA can serve as a fundamental service layer in the decentralized and shared mobile ecosystem, and collaborate

with other platforms running with DATA layer, such as decentralized App Stores and mobile SaaS platforms. Use of

DATA Tokens can be applied to any App Store or platform that supports DTA as a third party payment, for users to

purchase on premium services or IAP (in-app purchase) in apps or games. Figure 11 demonstrates a typical use

case of DATA Tokens.

Figure 12. Illustration of Yomob's Business

Ineffective advertising has always been a key problem in retaining the best user experiences and achieving the best

timing and placement for every advertisement across every demand-side advertiser and ad network SDK -- from

the cost of testing multiple iterations to the opportunity cost of siphoning off the time and attention that mobile

game and application developers should be spending on their core competencies.

As an ad exchange platform, Yomob focuses on video advertisement at the current stage and is integrated with

more than 50 major video ad networks and DSPs. As an aggregated ADX, Yomob can claim impartiality through a

wide range of advertiser bids. Al-powered programmatic head bidding and a BI dashboard also offer greater

transparency, so that both sellers and publishers can see the payout, or remove unsuitable ads.

Yomob's approach integrates an understanding of the applications’s user, the users’ psychology, and the nature of

the ad to match them at the right time, with the right users, at the time when they will be most interested in clicking.

The focus is achieving the best performance and least disruption for users, within applications.

In order to reduce costs, improve user experience, and boost revenue, Yomob offers what it calls a “zero rev share”
initiative, in which the developer gets the full payout from the advertising campaign that is displayed and watched

by the users.

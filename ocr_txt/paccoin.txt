Introduction

Introducing SPAC, a third generation
cryptocurrency that is focused on four key
factors:

Community
Charity
Content
Choice

PAC is a community driven successor to
Bitcoin, incorporating various improvements
such as a two-tier incentivized network,
known as the Masternode network.

The major aim of SPAC is to become the
most efficient and user-friendly
cryptocurrency that is available globally.

Our network features double-send proof
transactions and transaction history that is
erasable in terms of receiving funds.

SPAC works using the principle of
decentralization whilst upholding the belief

that our community is the face of the coin

www.paccoin.net
PAC | White Paper 2018 | 3

SPAC is established off of a self-governing
and funding model through incentivized full
nodes and a detailed roadmap. It is
spearheading a Decentralized Autonomous
Organization (DAO) that encourages and
rewards the community to develop and
enhance it.

SPAC has been improved from its
predecessor PACcoin in every aspect, SPAC
encompasses the latest in financial
technology, transcending blockchains that
are currently being developed.

This allows us to appeal to secure private
partners as well as allowing us to address
use cases in the mainstream market.

This approach will ensure a truly
decentralized P2P electronic cash system.
Fundamentals comparison

SPAC introduces a revolutionary set of
changes to the cryptocurrency world
Although Bitcoin provides pseudonymous
transactions in a public ledger, the network
provides nearly no privacy. Recent times
have shown that Bitcoin's current network is

unable to sustain affordable transactions
that can be confirmed in a reasonable time.

SPAC however, solves both the transaction
and privacy issues that Bitcoin suffers from
whilst also allowing users to provide the
same dual Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of
Service (PoS) design of SPAC.

What is Cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrency at its core aims to bea
decentralized peer-to-peer digital cash
system ran ona platform with the absence
of a central authority. It is digital money
created from code

The founder of Bitcoin (considered the
‘first-mover' in cryptocurrency) built a digital
cash system without any central entity.

In order to realize the value of digital cash,
you simply need a payment network that
consists of balances and accounts,
combined with tangible use cases anda
need for the currency to be chosen over
traditional fiat currencies.

More than 50% of all people on earth have no access to the
global financial market. It's not about drugs, money laundering,

y, EES
SS,

[Stier

weapons and speculation, it's about global financial freedom.

Individual cryptocurrencies are digital and
cannot be counterfeited or reversed
arbitrarily by the sender, as with credit card
charge-backs. This provides numerous
security advantages over traditional forms
of currency.

Cryptocurrency is not bound by exchange
rates, interest rates, transaction charges or
other charges of any country. Therefore, it
can be used at an international level
without experiencing any problems. This, in
turn, saves lots of time as well as money on
the part of any business which is otherwise
spent in transferring money from one
country to the other.

Blockchain technology

A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed
and public digital ledger that is used to
recover transactions across many
computers so that the record cannot be
altered retroactively without the alteration
of all subsequent blocks and the collusion of
he network

Blockchains grow constantly as a new block
is ‘mined’ and are recorded ina
chronological format from the most recent
o the least recent. It gives market
participants the opportunity to track their
digital currency transaction without any

orm of central record keeping.

For every computer that is connected to the
network, there is always a blockchain copy
that is dedicated to it and automatically
downloaded.

Blockchains were actually developed as a
way of accounting for virtual currency.
Blockchains are a form of distributed ledger
echnology and they are slowly appearing
in commercial applications that are seeing
he benefits of the technology.

Blockchains are currently used to check

ransactions that are made via digital
currencies although, it is also possible to
code or embed any form of document
within the blockchains.

This creates a permanent record that
cannot be altered. Instead of confirming a
record authenticity through a centralized
authority, blockchains are used.

www.paccoin.net
PAC | White Paper 2018 | 8

How blockchains work

A wants to send SPAC to B.

The transaction is reoresented online
as a block.

The block is broadcast to every party
in the network.

Those in the network approve the
transaction is valid.

The block can then be added to the
chain, which provides an indelible
and transparent record of
transactions.

SPAC then moves from A to B.

I/

Blockchain breakdown
A block is a section of a blockchain that keeps track of all the recent transactions. Blocks are
added to the chain in a linear fashion, storing input and output transactions forming a perfect
ledger reaching back to the first (i.e. genesis) block. Each new blocks records new information
to the chain in a secure, verifiable, and permanent manner.

The design of blockchain makes these transactions immutable thereby preventing them from
being deleted. Cryptography is the method that is used to add the blocks thereby making sure
that there is a middle-proof. It is possible for the data to be distributed but not directly copied.
The growth of the blockchain size still remains a problem as it affects synchronization and
storage.

Blockchain extensions
Based on the normal banking ideology, blockchain can be regarded as a full
history of a financial institution's transactions. Every block denotes an individual
bank statement but considering the fact that it is a distributed database system
that is acting as an open electronic ledger, a blockchain can simplify business
operations for parties. This makes blockchain technology attractive to exchanges
and financial institutions. Most people have suggested that this electronic ledger
system should also be adopted for voting systems, vehicle registrations, medical
records and even the ownership confirmation of artwork and antiquities.

www.paccoin.net
PAC | White Paper 2018 | 9
Benefits of blockchains

The use of blockchains can result in serious
cost savings, blockchain systems give
businesses and banks the opportunities to
streamline internal operations thereby
strategically reducing mistakes, delays and
expenses caused by the traditional methods
of keeping records.

The adoption of blockchain technology will
give rise to the following benefits

1. An automated blockchain technology
reduces errors and eliminates repetitive
confirmation steps.

2. Electronic ledgers are very cheap to
maintain as compared to the traditional
accounting systems.

3. There is minimal capital that is held at risk
of pending transactions thereby reducing
processing delay.

N= ae

A financial company that currently utilizes blockchains is ‘Proof of Existence’. They
store encrypted information using blockchain technology thereby enabling a
transaction that cannot be replicated to be linked to an original document.
Microsoft and other firms are also showing interest in cryptocurrencies, they
recently built a partnership with Consensus in December of 2015.

In addition to these three major benefits,
and the considerable amount of funds that
can be saved, transparency will also be
improved.

With blockchain technology, auditing will
become easy and smart contracts can be
created or payments can be triggered when
specific conditions are met.

Tech companies are attracted by the idea of
eliminating middlemen and diving towards
decentralization and demoralization
thereby adopting the blockchain technology
across various industries.

Silicon Valley and other startups are already
leveraging blockchain technology.
The rebirth of PAC

SPAC is a 3rd generation peer to peer
cryptocurrency. Built for the people, lead by social
governance.

A new team, improved tech, new vision and a
strong community are what makes up the
foundation of SPAC. PAC's predecessor PACcoin
taught us valuable lessons that have given us the
foresight to bring SPAC to companies and
individuals around the world.

Like Bitcoin, S$PAC uses a blockchain database to
coordinate and manage values that exists between
two untrusted individuals. The use of SPAC is
governed by masternodes and credited with $PAC
for their participation in the network.

Open Source

The source code is available

for reading. SPAC evolution is

being developed on a private
branch.

The entire SPAC code will be
open source during the
second week of Feb.

$PAC has solved
the problems that
Bitcoin is struggling
with and represents
a digital currency
that can be used
as Digital Cash.

PAC | White Paper 2018 | 11

History

PACcoin was created in 2014 based upon
then-current technologies. Initially, it enjoyed
a brief success as a traded cryptocurrency.

However, over the years, the coin was not
maintained or upgraded; subsequently it
quickly fell to the bottom of the list of the
1200+ different cryptocurrencies on the
market.

PACcoin remained stagnant until August
2017, when a new community-based
management team committed to
re-establishing the coin. In November of 2017
aspects of the code were upgraded to offer
new PACcoin wallets on PACcoin's updated
website.

By the end of November 2017 PACcoin
registered its first measurable market cap of
$1,885,638 USD. During PACcoin's relaunch,
over 30,000 wallets were downloaded and
Cryptopia, PACcoin's most dominant
exchange, had over a million new
registrations.

This sudden uptick overwhelmed Cryptopia's
servers which accounted for, at the time, 90%
of our trading volume, forcing the New
Zealand based exchange to suspend
trading, unfortunately with PACcoin at the
top of the list for volume. With demand and
volume exceeding expectations, PACoin’s
development team has been hard at work
making improvements to the code, and
facilitating a wide future for the coin.

www.paccoin.net
PAC | White Paper 2018 | 12

Improving PACcoin to $PAC

Starting with a new coin based off of the
DASH platform the current total supply of
PACcoin will be reduced, providing a whole
host of benefits. The current total supply of
100 trillion PACcoin with 3.5 trillion having
already been mined into circulation will be
reduced via an RCO (Redemption Coin
Offering) offering one new SPAC for each
1,000 existing PACcoin, with each new SPAC's
value increasing as a result.

This will reduce the total supply to 100
billion with 3.5 billion in circulation. The
amount of data in the blockchain will shrink
dramatically, resulting in wallets syncing
faster, thus allowing the chain to be more
easily installed across the globe.

Since Bitcoin's inception, there have been
several new algorithms developed to
improve on the blockchain technology. One
of the measures that $PAC's team are taking
is moving away from the SHA 256 platform
and adopting the x11 platform, first
introduced by DASH.

The x11 platform will allow completely
anonymous transactions in as little as under
two seconds. Instead of hashing only one
algorithm, with SHA256, the x11 platform
hashes 11 different algorithms
simultaneously, which reduces the
amount of computing needed to mine
or transfer data. In addition to the X11
platform, PAC will also be utilizing
masternodes, another concept
made popular by DASH.

X11 explained

X11 is a widely used hashing algorithm created
by DASH core developer Evan Duffield. X11's
chained hashing algorithm utilizes a sequence
of eleven scientific hashing algorithms for the
proof-of-work. This is so that the processing
distribution is fair and coins will be distributed in
much the same way Bitcoin's were originally. X11
was intended to make ASICs much more difficult
to create, thus giving the currency plenty of time
to develop before mining centralization became
a threat. This approach was largely successful;
as of early 2016, ASICs for X11 now exist and
comprise a significant portion of the network
hashrate, but have not resulted in the level of
centralization present in Bitcoin.

X11 is the name of the chained proof-of-work
(PoW) algorithm that was introduced in DASH
(launched January 2014 as "Xcoin"). It was
partially inspired by the chained-hashing
approach of Quark, adding further “depth" and
complexity by increasing the number of hashes,
yet it differs from Quark in that the rounds of
hashes are determined a priori instead of
having some hashes being randomly picked

The X11 algorithm uses multiple rounds of 11
different hashes (blake, bmw, groestl, jh, kKeccak,
skein, luffa, cubehash, shavite, simd, echo), thus
making it one of the safest and more
sophisticated cryptographic hashes in use by
modern cryptocurrencies.

The name X11 is not related to the GUI server
that provides a graphical interface to Unix/Linux
users.

www.paccoin.net
PAC | White Paper 2018 | 14

Advantages of X11

Increased confidence and safety for currencies
The increased complexity and sophistication of
the chained algorithm provides enhanced levels
of security and less uncertainty for a digital
currency, compared to single-hash PoW
solutions that are not protected against security
risks like SPOF (Single Point Of Failure). For
example, a possible but not probable
computing breakthrough that “breaks” the
SHA256 hash could jeopardize the entire Bitcoin
network until the network shifts through a hard
fork to another cryptographic hash

In the event of a similar computing
breakthrough, a digital currency using the X11
PoW would continue to using X11 to take
measures and replace the problematic hashes
with other more reliable hashing algorithms

Given the speculative nature of digital currencies
and their inherent uncertainties as a new field,
he X11 algorithm can provide increased
confidence for its users and potential investors
hat single-hash approaches cannot. Chained
ashing solutions, like X11, provide increased
safety and longevity for store of wealth
purposes, investment diversification and
edging against risks associated with
single-hash currencies plagued by SPOF (Single
Point Of Failure).

Evan Duffield, the creator of DASH and X11
chained-hash, has wrote on several occasions
that X11 was integrated into DASH not with the
intention to prevent ASIC manufacturers from
creating ASICs for X11 in the future, but rather to
provide a similar migratory path that Bitcoin
had (CPUs, GPUs, ASICs)
Incentive structure

SPAC incentives are an informal way of motivating the community to encourage the growth

and reach of SPAC, whilst rewarding them for doing so. These incentives are superfluous to

the overall goal of SPAC but exist as a means to compensate active community members.

Affiliate bonus
We will have an affiliate
program where we will offer
SPAC rewards for the top

producing affiliates.

These will be tiered and aims
to pair investor groups
together to mutually share
rewards for supporting SPAC’s
future.

oOo
Content producers

Using SPAC as a social
currency will aim to help
content producers get fairly
compensated directly inside
our own and various other

social platforms.

Community bounties & prizes

Retail value

Both the SPAC team, as well as the community, can offer several
social bounty programs that will help spread and share SPAC
projects and initiatives. Hosted from within the Paclyfe platform

$PAC rewards

SPAC would offer an
excellent platform to
facilitate third party rewards
programs. for e.g. SPAC could
act as a medium of
exchange within private
corporate networks to
reward staff internally for
hitting targets and/or
achieving goals. Then using
their SPAC to purchase

goods/services.

SPAC is a digital currency and it is pronounced the same wherever

you are. SPAC is phonetic and pronounceable worldwide providing

an important linguistic foundation for mass global adoption

www.paccoin.net
PAC | White Paper 2018 | 13
History of POS

Proof-of-Service or POS was originally
applied to the parent of the old PACcoin,
Peercoin, designed by Sunny King. This was
the initial alternative dual method of
securing the network and the creation of
new blocks of coins

This system proved to be much more energy
efficient compared to traditional POW
mining via ASICS and CPU powered miners.

The more coins that a specific node owns or
locks up, the more they stake and protect
the network. As part of the coin reward for
this protective network service, nodes that
stake coins would be allowed to ‘mint’ new
coins (this is just like interest in the real
world). Coin age is generally the initial

requirement for staking and POS rewards

n.net
hite Pap

The old coin created an unfair coin distribution model, directly contradicting our
belief of equality and fairer community rewards and was a key design flaw of the
original coin. The new coin addresses this distribution of wealth imbalance.

In the old PACcoin for example, the minting
period was set at 30 days. After this initial 30
day window is achieved, the coins will POS
or mint new PACcoins at a rate of roughly
7-9% in the current PACcoin model.

Since PACcoin's implementation, POS has
changed to be used completely separate
from the POW system by significant number
of other coin designs.

This is primarily to support a more efficient
energy usage model. The use of POS
specifically in terms of its use in PACcoin has
caused quite a controversy as the model
rewards larger wallets with a majority of the
future coin supply.

Masternodes

Masternodes are a way for community
members to provide service to the network
by putting up a certain amount of coins in
their SPAC wallets in return for a reward
known as a POS (Proof of Service).

This serves as collateral alongside an
automatic ledger, which verifies
transactions without risk. SPAC users will
need 500,000 $PAC to run a masternode.

Shared masternodes will also become
available with the launch of Paclyfe in early
2018. How to calculate the return on
investment for masternodes:

PrivateSPAC

Internet commerce in today's world is
focused on developing a trust system where
the privacy of a user's transactions is a
desirable feature.

Coins like electroneum, on Android and
iPhone have this anonymity built in via
protocol extensions. These extensions allow
for anonymous transactions to be possible.

PrivateSPAC is an enhanced version of the
CoinJoin system. Besides just using CoinJoin,
SPAC will employ a series of technical
improvements such as decentralization and
a high degree of anonymity leveraging this
chaining approach where there is mixing
that occurs well ahead of the future
transaction.

This feature has to be deployed in a fashion
that will both improve privacy and
fungibility in such a way that the blockchain
doesn't hurt the credibility of the original
blockchain.

Fungibility is a core component of money, it
requires that all the pieces of a currency
remain equal. For example, when you get
coins via PrivateSPAC, these coins should
not have any fingerprints from their previous
transactions or users.

www.paccoin.net
PAC | White Paper 2018 | 17

For coins such as Bitcoin, people are able to
determine which coins are unspent and
which ones are, via a methodology called
UTXO, which stands for an Unspent
Transaction Output.

The outcome of this system provides a
ledger that allows any node to be the
guarantor to ensure the integrity of these
transactions.

Protocols used by coins such as Bitcoin are
designed to participate in the network
without the participation of other trusted
nodes, without them it is very important that
the auditing methods are still able to be
used by others on the public blockchain.

PrivateSPAC’s goal is to improve transaction
privacy and still maintain the key elements
of a successful crypto currency.

SPAC's decentralized wallet mixing service
maintains the integrity of its fungibility.

This ensures all coins are equal, and the
integrity of the public ledger is maintained
without compromising user's rights to
private transactions.

InstantSPAC

SPAC's Masternode layer has additional
benefits over simply reducing the
participation costs for casual nodes. One
major advantage of a Masternode layer is
the ability send and receive instant
irreversible transactions in a ‘trustless'
manner. Forming a quorum, through the
selection of N randomized masternodes,
allows SPAC to replace what used to require
an entire network of nodes with only that
small subset of trusted, bonded,
Masternodes.

The four C's

Choice
SPAC stands for the ‘People's Alternative Choice’ a new form of Internet Currency. Having a choice in an alternative store

of value promotes internet commerce and fosters innovation. The huge burden of current rules and regulations destroy
the innovation within the current business economy. We also see a legal system that is fracturing under its own lack of
clear choices. SPAC is going back to the grassroots - where systems evolve from great ideas and innovative energy. This

SPAC system will enable resources to solve and find solutions -vs- getting stalled in legal conflicts.

Content

In the middle of the SPAC economy SPAC becomes the primary medium of exchange. Content now becomes one of the
vehicles that is exchanged as a value. An example of this would be a service marketplace where people would be
looking to purchase new branding for their business, or an intro video explaining their offerings. PAClyfe.net will house this
marketplace where these digital products can be sold via SPAC to others in the community. The real-world analog or

example of this type of system is FIVERR.com.

Community

Communities come together and provide support to solve and identify problems throughout the SPAC economy. We have
discovered the beginning of a social governance framework that will enable our social network to evolve into a
problem-solving machine. The complexities of managing a decentralized community will be challenging - but not
impossible. The goal will be to discover proposals for the SPAC economy and promote them to the master-nodes for final

approval and resource allocation.

Charity

Charitable focus is another cornerstone of the SPAC economy. Charitable focus is a fundamental value of many of the
problems in our day-to-day lives that can be solved easily in a community environment. The community continually grows
in its ability to help charitable causes as people discover together the benefit of functional charitable economy.
Charitable focus will always be the “foundational fabric” of the SPAC ecosystem. Many brands will want to help support
the SPAC system as they align their brands to support interests of both parties. We will have a charitable crowd funding

platform similar to Kickstarter on PAClyfe.net to build this charitable SPAC platform.

already adopted by the SPAC community:
The People's Alternative Choice.

SPAC is continuously developing new features
to be added to our community-based social

Social governance

Decentralized Governance by Blockchain
allows the community to be involved in the
decision-making regarding projects related
to SPAC. Masternodes are the main actors in
the governance process, they can create
new proposals and vote (yes/no/abstain) on
existing proposals.

Each time a block is generated, 45% of the
block reward goes to the Masternode
network, 35% goes to the miners and then,
once every 16,616 blocks (approximately 30.3
days) a ‘Superblock’ is generated containing
the entire 20% payout to the proposals
winners of the previous cycle

Anyone can vote or make proposals. A
proposal wins only if the approval is greater
than the 10% of the total masternode count
at that time.

The community vote will decide on what
improvements and programs the
development team focuses on. The current
break down is that 15% of the block reward
is for operations, and 5% is destined for
charity.

Masternode holders will then allocate
resources and time to these proposed

Pac.media

Alternative news is a major component of
the world today. Suppressed news, fake
news and censorship litters the landscape
and people don't know what to believe
anymore.

The internet has fueled a movement of
alternative news/content where anybody
can promote what they believe in. These
smaller providers depend on getting paid
from big ad networks that constantly
change the rules on how they get their
income

These smaller providers can’t compete with
the larger media outlets money interests.

They are missing their own brand affiliation

Content providers will be able to plug-into
the SPAC based economy by purchasing a
master-node, which essentially becomes an
ongoing revenue stream for their day-to-day
work. They can display and ‘use’ the
PAC.media affiliation on their channels as
well

Obviously, there are a lot of ‘red’ flags this
innovative approach will raise - these will all
be handled by integrating already
functional systems into this new brand
framework and PAC.media will be the
cornerstone of this new media-based
economy. This core will be supported by
other integrated partnerships that leverage
the value of the SPAC medium of exchange.

Abstract

Bulwark (ticker: BWK) is a community-oriented coin born out of an observation o

generally unfair practices within the masternode privacy

fair, launch strategy allows participants the opportunity

at inception. We offer a simple value proposition with no grandiose promise: we wil

deliver a privacy coin that works today and into the future
from both DASH and PIVX. No fanciful visions with a

but a working coin on a working platform with support int

coin space. Our deliberate,

to join a promising project

by leveraging best-practices

imited prospect of delivery,

o the future. This does not

mean we plan no innovation, but instead that we will deliver results rather than hype.

There are too many coins that are fueled by hype - but completely devoid of substance

- and we do not want to join the growing cadre of coins

riven by the motto of over-

promise and under deliver. With no ICO, a soft-launch reward ramp, small premine,

and miner-favored block reward allocations, Bulwark ado

ters will have ground-floor

access to a privacy coin offering a blend of masternodes and the best available privacy

coin technology alongside a meaningful development roadmap. Masternodes will be

available, and functioning, on launch and are a fundamen

al part of this coin’s vision

and will stabilize circulation, secure the network, and provide important functionality.

Bulwark would not have been possible without the prior works of the respective Bitcoin,
Peercoin, Blackcoin, Talkcoin, Dash and PIVX teams. Open source software and its
contributors are constantly paving the way toward new and exciting innovations. When
information and knowledge are free to build upon, society as a whole benefits. We are

grateful to our predecessors for the opportunity to contribute to this growing ecosystem.

Brief Introduction to Cryptocurrency

1.1 Background

In 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto released a paper entitled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic
Cash System detailing his vision of commerce. Nakamoto’s vision detailed a peer-to-peer
currency system backed by a hash based proof-of-work. The network would timestamp
transactions by hashing them into an ongoing ledger that could not be changed without
redoing the proof-of-work. Nodes would choose the longest chain as proof of events
witnessed by the largest pool of hashing power. As long as > 51% of the network
hashing power is controlled by nodes not intending to facilitate an attack, the chain

they generate will remain the longest. (Nakamoto 2009)

1.2 The Block

Each block on the network is prefaced with an 80 byte header containing a double
SHA256 hashed copy of the previous block’s header, merkle root (a double SHA256
hashed derivation of all the hashes that occurred in the block), the time stamp at which
proof-of-work began, difficulty target this header’s hash must be less-than or equal to,
and the nonce at which miners reached the difficulty target. As such, any attempts
to modify any transaction in any block will result in the rejection of the block by the

network’s miners. (Bitcoin Core Team 2017)
1.3. The Blockchain

Groups of transactions are formed into blocks and those blocks are placed chronologically
into a chain - forming the blockchain. The blockchain creates a moving history of all of
the activity within the network and serves as a distributed consensus model where any

transaction can be verified at any time (Crosby et al. 2015).

1.4 Proof-Of-Work

Proof-of-Work is a system of verification in which miners must devote tangible resources
(electricity, hardware costs) to solve an arbitrary probabilistic word puzzle. In order for
a bad actor to taint the blockchain with a fraudulent transaction, they must complete

all proof-of-work up to the present point. (Okupski 2016)

1.5 Proof-Of-Stake

Proof-of-Stake is a competition between shareholders, where based on connectivity to
the network and random chance, you can receive new coins to assist in the decentral-
ization of the network. Proof-Of-Stake is far more energy efficient in that it requires no
dedicated hardware and negligible amounts of electricity to reward miners, and in many

cases is far more resilient to a 51% attack on the network. (Blackcoin Core Team 2016)
Chapter 2

Introducing Bulwark

2.1 A solid foundation

Every home needs a solid foundation, and Bulwark is no different. Bulwark is built upon
PIVX, which itself is built upon the popular DASH cryptocurrency. While lineages can
all be traced back to the original Satoshi Core, each project has chosen a particular
direction with goals and ideals that represent the communities they serve. We will
extend, and place emphasis on, the privacy coin features of our predecessor platforms
by exploring new technologies, while creating tool sets and opportunities for Bulwark’s

integration into present day technology platforms.

2.2 A team dedicated to the community

For some projects, communities are an afterthought. Bulwark’s number one priority
is the community. With giveaways, contests, a lively discussion platform and a zero-
tolerance policy toward the harassment of newcomers, Bulwark strives to be the cryp-
tocurrency for all varieties of end-users. Members of our userbase are already contribut-

ing useful scripts and guides to further enhance the user experience.
2.3 Fair and balanced

At the time of writing, there have been an influx of cryptocurrencies utilizing a similar
foundation. While the underlying technology is solid, oftentimes a deeper examination

of their specifications and blockchain parameters reveals less-than-fair practices.

24 Fast and functional

With a 90 second block time, masternode consensus and transaction locking, reasonable
emissions schedule, and eco-friendly staking, Bulwark aspires to be a truly fast and

functional cryptocurrency.

3.2. SlowStart

Our fair start is provided with the following code snippet (Credit: ZCash).

int64_t nSlowSubsidy = 50 * COIN;

if (nHeight < 960 / 2) f{ // If block height less than 480,
nSlowSubsidy /= 960; // Set nSubsidy to .05208333
nSlowSubsidy *= nHeight; // Multiply present height by .05208333

} else if (nHeight < 960 { // ez: Block 200, BR will be 10.41666600
nSlowSubsidy /= 960; // Credits: ZCASH Team

nSlowSubsidy *= nHeight;

The slow start period averages at 25 coins per block at block 960.

3.3 Dark Gravity Wave 3.0

Dark Gravity Wave is employed by Bulwark from the start as a method of retargeting
PoW difficulty. It uses a simple moving average that can respond to large nethash
increases or drop-offs in just a few blocks. This alleviates the “stuck block effect” often
caused by multipools and prevents one person adding a substantial amount of computing

power from instantly solving more than a few blocks.

NIST5 Hashing

5.1 Why NISTS

Popularized by TalkCoin in 2014, the NIST5 hashing algorithm has seen modest main-
stream usage. NIST5 can be mined on a wide array of consumer-grade hardware in-
cluding CPUs, as well as AMD and Nvidia GPUs. NIST5 is not as ASIC resistant
as some other memory hard algorithms, but we believe the trade-off is acceptable to
improve system stability and reduce power consumption relative to those memory hard

algorithms.

5.2. The Five Finalists (NIST SHA-3 Competition)

The five hashing algorithms that make up NIST5 are the finalists from the NIST Hashing

Competition (Chang et al. 2012). They are (in the order that blocks are hashed):

Blake (Aumasson 2010), Grgstl (Gauravaraml et al. 2011), JH (Wu 2012), Keccak
(Bertoni et al. 2012), and Skein (Ferguson et al. 2010)

5.3 The new SHA-3 Standard

Keccak eventually passed the final round to be named the new SHA-3 hashing function,
while the other four algorithms (despite being considered cryptographically secure) lost

a few points from the judges for some minor technicalities. We believe the combination
of the new SHA-3 standard along with the other finalist choices provide a quick, secure,

and established hashing algorithm.

5.4 Mining Software Available

Chapter 6

Feature Set

6.1 Masternodes

Masternodes are, essentially, a decentralized web of computers that serve the Bulwark
network. Masternodes perform important network functions and receive part of the
block rewards. They serve the Bulwark ecosystem by stabilizing coin supply, processing
transactions, and securing the network. Masternodes require 5000 BWK and modest
technical knowledge to operate. Any wallet controlling 5000 BWK can set up a mas-

ternode.

6.2. Obfuscation / Coin Mixing

Bulwark features Obfuscation, based on CoinJoin but with various improvements over
the original, and done via coin mixing in a decentralized fashion facilitated by the
network of masternodes. This provides an additional layer of privacy in transactions.
While not perfectly anonymous, Obfuscation via node mixing it is far better than the
standard Bitcoin transaction. For example, all Bitcoin transactions are transparent. For
Bulwark, a nefarious actor would need to control 50% of the operating masternodes to
have less than 0.5% chance of de-anonymizing a single transaction that was mixed with
8 rounds of Obfuscation (Kiraly 2017b). This important feature provides a high-level

of anonymity for BWK users that elect to obfuscate their transactions.

11
6.3 SwiftTX

SwiftTX provides masternodes with locking and consensus authority for transactions.
When a transaction is submitted to the network, a group of masternodes will validate
the transaction. If those masternodes reach consensus on the transaction’s validity it
will be locked for later introduction into the blockchain, greatly increasing transaction
speed compared to conventional systems (like Bitcoin’s 10 minute block times with
multiple confirmations). SwiftTX makes it possible for multiple transactions to take
place before a block on the network is mined with the same inputs. This system is
based on Dash’s InstantSend. (Kiraly 2017a).

6.4 Sporks

The Bulwark network employs the multi-phased fork mechanism known as “sporking”.
This will enable the BWK network to implement new features while minimizing the
chances of an unintended network fork during rollout. Spork changes are deployable via
the network and can be turned on and off as necessary without requiring node software
updates (Strophy 2017). This feature is extremely useful and allows the network to

react quickly to security vulnerabilities.

6.5 TOR & IPV6 Masternodes

Bulwark allows the user to run their full node or masternode from either an onion address
or an IPV6 address. We have been working to add full TOR nodes to both strengthen
the TOR network itself, and the Bulwark user experience operating in TOR only mode.
A unique feature of TOR masternode support is being able to operate your masternode
as a TOR hidden service. TOR nodes enable users with stable internet connections
to operate masternodes out of their home network without the privacy implications of
revealing their location or the dangers of exposing their home network to the potential

for attack or compromise.

12
6.6 Community Importance and the Governance System

The Bulwark community is the most important factor behind the long-term success
of the project, and their ability to meaningfully influence the future of the coin is
paramount. As such, at the end of our first year, at block 345,601, we intend to activate
budget superblocks on the network. These superblocks, paid monthly, will enable the
community to exert meaningful control over all aspects of Bulwark’s development, brand
presence, and community affairs. Delaying the activation of this system will give us
time to develop the underlying framework necessary for a positive user experience, and

maximize block rewards available to miners and masternodes.

We will utilize a multi-phase process for creating and submitting proposals. Each step
will need to be fully completed. Failure to complete the steps outlined will likely result

in a proposal not being activated. A basic outline of these steps are as follows:

¢ Start in our Discord chat, and talk with some of the seasoned users. Gauge interest
and if the response is positive, move to the next phase.

¢ Utilize multiple social media platforms to discuss and get feedback. Remember
that Bulwark has a diverse userbase and differing levels of governance participa-
tion, reaching a portion of the userbase will often require some footwork. Take
note of these discussions and be able to cite them in the formal pre-proposal. The
more citations provided, the better.

« Be open to suggestions from the community and developers. Be flexible and
willing to incorporate external ideas and suggestions in your proposal.

« Create a formal pre-proposal on the Governance->Pre-Proposal section of our
website. Provide citations for all discussions that occurred from the previous step.
Treat your pre-proposal as if it is what will be submitted to the blockchain for
voting.

« Upon completion of these steps, you will submit your proposal to the blockchain.
Be prepared for two fees, one at the time of submission and a ballot fee paid to

the developer that activates your proposal on the blockchain. The submission

fee is non-refundable, and the balloting fee will only be paid upon approval and
activation of your proposal.

e Everyone is free to adjust their proposal to include the reimbursement cost of
these two fees. Please make sure in your formal proposal you state that you are
adding reimbursement to the stipend requested.

« Be sure to get back in touch with everyone you spoke with so your idea will be

voted on. For a proposal to be paid out, 10% of the eligible masternodes must

13
vote ‘yes’ on your proposal. This process of getting a 10% consensus can be much
harder than it sounds, so be diligent, informative, and respectful in procuring the
votes necessary for your proposal to be paid.

6.7 SeeSaw PoS/Masternode Rewards

We have decided to utilize the SeeSaw reward system popularized by PIVX (Jaki-
man 2017). The SeeSaw reward system begins with a 9:1 block reward ratio (fa-
voring masternodes), and smoothly adjusts the ratio of reward between staking and
node operators until around 41.5% of coins in circulation are locked into mastern-
odes, at which time staking rewards reach a slight advantage over masternode re-
wards on a coin-by-coin basis. The reason we have the SeeSaw slightly favoring stak-
ing rewards is because we want to avoid the problems - like significant price volatil-
ity and low liquidity - that impact coins with very-high percentages of their circu-

n

lating supply locked in nodes. This strategy will mitigate user frustration over ac-
cess to coin supply and maintains the relevance of our robust network. With one of
our goals being a well-supported platform for anonymous commerce, transactability

is of the utmost importance to those accepting Bulwark and those holding Bulwark.

6.8 Open Source Stance

The Bulwark team is a strong proponent of open source development. All works, present
and future, will always be made open source to the community. Cryptocurrency is a
massively growing technological endeavor and we strongly believe that proprietary and
closed source developments hinder advancement and innovation. Scripts, toolsets, and
codebases for all Bulwark projects are free for others to use under the appropriate open

source license.

15
Chapter 7

The Future

7.1 Privacy and Software Enhancements

We are committed to adopting new protocols that will enhance the privacy of our
userbase. There are several paths we are evaluating at present and plan to begin internal

testing and development of in the first half of 2018. Some of these enhancements include:

e [2P privacy network

« Zerocoin protocol or Stealth addressing (When we are confident in the maturity
of the solution)

¢ Synchronizing our codebase closer with Bitcoin mainline

¢ Streamlining/Updating QT Wallet

7.2 Extension of our Branding

We will continue to extend our brand and intend to work with hardware vendors and
system integrators which share the same passion and ideals that we do. In five years we
want the name ‘Bulwark’ to be synonymous with not just cryptocurrency but privacy,
security, and the respect for a user’s freedom. Bulwark’s main purpose is to provide

freedom of choice through privacy.

16
7.3 Design and Visual

Through Research and Development, we aim to create a visual design for Bulwark
that sets it apart from its competition in the crypto market. Our design team plans to
innovate and experiment with the current UI/UX/Branding to ultimately achieve design
excellence by searching for a medium that allows the best user experience, and aesthetics
that are innovative and beautiful. This will be done by researching our competitors,
keeping on top of current technological trends & standards, and continuously striving

to bring new and exciting visuals to the end-users.

7.4 Bulwark Secure Home Node

We will be working with CAD specialists to design a small, self-contained, home Bulwark
node. Users will be able to connect this to their home network and configure using a

Web UI. The functions we intend to launch with are as follows:

e For those with stable internet connections, an easy to set up fully onionized mas-
ternode (or full node) using TOR hidden services

¢ Bulwark staking through either virtualization or an add-on device

In keeping with the spirit of decentralization, all source code will be available to the

community for home assembly.

7.5 Bulwark Payment Gateway

The Bulwark team originally reworked the WooCommerce plugin for use in selling the
first version of the Bulwark Secure Home Node on our website. As with all of our
developments, we will continue fine tuning and improving this development so that any
online merchant can utilize our software to be able to utilize Bulwark as a payment
method.

17
7.6 Bulwark Hardware Wallet

The first standalone and open source hardware wallet on which users will be able to
safely and securely store Bulwark. Hardware specifications as well as software will be
made open source upon launch so any cryptocurrency can fork it to use for their own
project. The goal with the Bulwark Hardware Wallet is to allow the community a
cheap and cost effective alternative to storing their coins without having to rely on

larger companies that provide overpriced solutions on closed source hardware.

7.7 Bulwark Home Router

A standalone router, secure home node, and staking box all wrapped in one package.
The Bulwark Home Router will allow routing of all network traffic through optional TOR
or I2P network routing , allowing for the best in security and privacy while maintaining

all the capabilities enjoyed by the Bulwark Secure Home Node.

18
Chapter 8

Conclusion

8.1 Summary

Bulwark is a privacy-oriented coin with masternodes, governance, and an evolving
ecosystem of tools. The project began with a fair launch and a focus on broad coin
distribution. The slow start, block reward split, and hashing algorithm were deliber-
ately selected to create opportunities for significant community participation. Bulwark
launched with a variety of important privacy coin features and the development team is
hard at work to introduce new features and build upon existing technologies. Bulwark

aims to empower choice through privacy and will focus considerable effort to this end.

8.2. Future work

The masternode privacy coin ecosystem has recently been inundated by coins seeking to
entice new users through promises of substantial returns on investment, gigantic road
maps filled with improbable deliverables, and a general focus on marketing over actual
improvement within the space. Bulwark plans to be the opposite: low on hype creation
and high on actual creation. Present and future goals for the project will follow the

formula of being specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time bound.

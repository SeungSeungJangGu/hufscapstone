Problem We Are Solving

Counterfeiting is a serious issue that claims thousands
of lives and costs billions of dollars

At least 63 babies died in Fuyang and rural
areas of Anhui after consuming fake baby milk.

2004 baby food scandal in China

6 infants killed and 54.000 hospitalised.
China reported 300.000 victims in total.

2008 baby food scandal in China

461 billion USD in value of
imported fake goods.
OECD

64% of pharmaceuticals in Nigeria
are fake.

Solution and Technology

Blockchain can solve the problem with digital assets but
can not secure physical assets

Cryptographic technologies akin to Blockchain
opened new horizons by ensuring the uniqueness
of digital assets and the security of transactions

ay There has yet to be a technology able to securely

ay protect the link between physical and digital
assets while being cost effective

So far only high-end products such as diamonds
could benefit from the security of the digital ledger -
through expensive scanning of physical parameters.
See hitps://www.everledger.io/ as an example

Walimai has developed a solution that securely links

limo a physical item to its digital representation at a cost
that allows us to protect everyday consumer goods
‘aX such as milk-powder, pharmaceuticals, alcohol,
and cosmetics both physically and digitally.

Creating a secure link between Physical and Digital
required solving unique challenges in both domains

ROBUSTNESS

FRAGILITY

We wanted to bring industry level security to everyday
consumer goods. We had to work within very tight hardware
constraints while leveraging insights from cryptography,
signal processing, economics, and behavioral science to
create the Walimai system:

Individual tags are securely protected
against falsification or copying

On the macro-level,
the system prohibits any unauthorised tampering

Solution and Technology

Walimai’s core technology is fully developed and has
been in operation since December 2016

After consumers have scanned
the item with Walimai app:
¢ Set of digital objects is stored

Walimai label is applied at a designated
‘point of origin’ along the supply chain.

This links the product with its digital in the cloud

representation in the cloud, containing: + Data from consumer scans are
* Encrypted unique ID checked against their digital

* Dynamic Code state

* Geographical Data + Digital and physical objects are

constantly synchronised

Products with the Walimai label are sold

on location:

* Consumers scan the label with Walimai
app which reads the ID, Dynamic Code, and
Geographical Data. This information is then
sent to the cloud for verification

* Public verification result is displayed to the

consumer

Solution and Technology

Walimai’s system effectively defends itself
against ‘label-cloning’ attacks

Below is a demonstration of system effectiveness in face of ‘label cloning’ attempts.
Scenario I:

Sophisticated attacker / Supply Chain NOT Compromised:
System response: geolocation data fails to match, resulting in failure of authentication

Scenario Il:

Sophisticated attacker/ Supply Chain Compromised (counterfeiter is able
to place products in designated locations)*

« If the product is not taken out of circulation:

There is a timegap in cloning and placing the object in circulation (which typically requires several
days) and the next customer scanning the original object (in case of ‘Fast Moving Consumer Goods’,
this typically takes minutes). During this gap, the pairing conditions are changed thus prohibiting
authentication.

« If the product is taken out of circulation:

In order for it to make economic sense, the counterfeiter needs to either sell the fake object at
a price premium to the original (which is counter sense) or create multiple copies of the object.
However, scanning one such counterfeit product will desynchronize the rest of the batch. This
invalidates any further matching attempts and makes the product unsalable.

* This is not solvable for QR-code based systems

Solution and Technology

Authentication, Security and WaBi Token

= One of the crucial security ingredients of the Walimai anti-counterfeiting system is the state of
permanent flux created by the dynamic codes that update the system state with each scan.

« The distributed verification process gives the system its crucial robustness, but at the same
time subjects it to the ‘voting paradox’. This means that with a sufficient level of trust in the Walimai
brand, consumers might not feel the need to scan the product at all, thus not updating the system.

“™
—> (vn

« This dynamic is dangerous, as it may reduce the rate of ‘system churning’ necessary to prevent
counterfeiters from slipping in a fake product.

« Therefore, it is essential we provide the consumers with incentive to keep on scanning and
authenticating through their smartphones’ RFID readers and our mobile application. A loyalty program
that ensures a sufficient level of ‘churning’ becomes a pivotal security attribute.

= In other words, every consumer who scans the Walimai label becomes a miner who is rewarded for
their contribution with WaBi tokens.

Our Vision

The ultimate secure channel for consumer products
spanning diverse categories and geographical locations

Encapsulating all vulnerable categories
Covering all consumer product categories that face the risk of counterfeiting.

An ‘Omni-Channel’
The Walimai label as a guarantee of product authenticity regardless of place of
purchase.

Our Vision

Safe omni-channel model naturally emerges from our
technology base

« Aworking label is a guarantee that the packaging
has not been tempered with, whether the product is
being sold on an open-air market in some remote
countryside

« Walimai labels greatly simplify the process of
keeping track of products’ ‘chain of custody’ for
iS) manufacturers, while also enabling a much higher
(@) degree of control over products’ distribution and
circulation. The practice of arbitrage by distributors

i.e. taking illicit advantage of price differentiation
between regions can thus be drastically reduced.

(oO=

NH atushistisdatiasbuttal « For the consumers, products with Walimai protection
signal a guarantee of authenticity as well as a

certain minimum standard of quality and service.

WaBi (#21) Coin Based System

China - Special Provisions: Main Features

Wabi Project’s ICO is taking place in times of significant regulatory turbulence. In the midst of
our ICO preparation process, the People’s Bank of China halted all ICO related activities in
China. Wabi Project is a Singapore-based company. However, a major part of our business
activities currently takes place in Mainland China. In order to comply with the existing
regulatory framework, as well as to mitigate the risks of future changes, we are making special
provisions for WaBi token circulation in regards to the China market. Below are the key
features of these provisions.

> All crypto activities (crypto payment processing, token issuance,
circulation of exchange-listed tokens) will be held outside of China.

> WaBi Project will develop a blockchain-based, remotely-hosted
loyalty program that will be licensed to Walimai China.

> Point issuance in Walimai China loyalty program will be rigidly
linked to WaBi through a smart escrow contract in a 1:1 ratio. In
other words, to issue 100 additional points for the Walimai China
loyalty program, WaBi Project must first obtain 100 WaBi tokens.

» Features and flexibility of the Walimai China loyalty program
will be in-line with the maximum allowable standard for loyalty
programs currently operational in China, pending further
regulation regarding crypto-activities.

» WaBi tokens will be user-exchangeable to Walimai China loyalty points
through the Wabi Project Itd., but NOT vice versa.

> In other markets WaBi tokens will be circulated in Walimai loyalty
programs directly, local regulations permitting.

020 Baby Shop Pilot Started in September

» We are extending access to safe and affordable infant formula to a grass-roots level.

« Every baby shop we enlist is equipped with a ‘Walimai-shelf’ which is placed in the middle of the
retail space.

« This shelf serves as a product display where consumers can get acquainted with the technology,
product assortment and purchasing options.

« The shelf plays the role of a checkout point. The consumer can place an order either through
the embedded touch screen or by scanning the QR-code and ordering in Walimai’s mobile
marketplace.

« Once the order is placed, it is sent to the connected warehouse for fulfillment.
« The consumer can either choose their home address or the baby shop for product delivery.

« We track the location of every order, and the baby shop where the order originated is
compensated on a profit-sharing basis.

ICO Details

PrelCO and ICO terms

PrelCO and ICO

* There will be 2 stages: first a prelCO, then the ICO itself. PrelCO will enable us to put together an
ICO that is appropriate for the scope of the project and the opportunity.

WaBi (#2711) token

¢ WaBi (#7) token will be used to purchase Walimai protected products (similar to loyalty program
points). This includes baby food, but also alcohol, cosmetics and any other products we plan to
protect with our technology. In terms of geography, we will start in China* but we'll grow outside
of China as well. It’s hard to predict the exact timing at this stage. This will also not be limited
to products that we sell ourselves: we plan to add other companies to the platform. These
companies will also join the WaBi coin system*.

* We will encourage the use of WaBi (#1) tokens in several ways:

* a) We set up a seamless usage process for consumers. b) We allow users to ‘mine’ tokens with
a proof of purchase of Walimai protected products. Buyers of products protected by Walimai
technology will receive some initial tokens when they start buying. We are reserving tokens at the
ICO specifically for that. c) Consumers using WaBi (#£711) will get better terms overall. This may
include discounts, special offers, discounted purchases of WaBi (#71) tokens, etc.

* Maximum supply of WaBi (#71) will be limited to 100.000.000 with the following split:

a) Up to 10.000.000 tokens will be sold at the prelCO at 0.03 USD/ token. Funds will be used
to launch the ICO. Up to an additional 1.000.000 tokens will be distributed through the bounty
program.

b) Up to 46.000.000 will be distributed at the ICO stage in November 2017 at 0.25 USD/ token.
The funds will be used to grow sales in baby stores, add more product categories (such as
alcohol) and set up the WaBi Project blockchain based, remotely hosted loyalty system. Part of
the funds will be used to buy back preWaBi tokens sold at prelCO as described below.

c) WaBi sold during the PrelCO will be either locked up for 3 or 6 months after the ICO (for 5%

or 10% bonus respectively, out of founders’ token allocation) or bought back by WaBi Project at
25 USD cent per WaBi after the ICO and before the token is placed on exchanges. WaBis thus

reclaimed will be put onto a company reserve with a 6 month lock-up period. (Assuming 50% of
prelCO contributors decide to sell, this reserve will amount to 5.500.000 tokens)

d) 8.000.000 will distributed among the founders, team members and bounties.

* Please see “China - Special Provisions’

PrelCO and ICO terms

e) The remaining 35.000.000 tokens will be reserved to be delivered to consumers through the
mining process. Consumers will receive tokens by purchasing Walimai protected products and
participating in other activities. These tokens will be held in an escrow. A merchant (seller of
products protected by Walimai technology) will be entitled to release WaBi tokens equivalent of
5% worth of their quarterly increase in sales of his products, from the escrow into circulation,
by distributing these tokens among the customers in the form of rewards and discounts. The
merchant will just sign the distribution order, no WaBi will pass onto the merchant this way.

Here is an example explaining point (e):

Merchant H sells cosmetics with Walimai protection. H used to sell 1m USD/month of cosmetics
and grew sales to 1.3m USD over a quarter. Suppose, at the same time the price of WaBi at

an exchange is 10 USD. H will then be eligible to distribute (1.3m-1m)*5%/10=1500 WaBi to its
current or future buyers from the escrow.

The escrow holding the remaining tokens will be split into different wallets for additional security.
Merchant/consumer interactions will be done through the Walimai Authentication Interface and go
through a system of checks and balances to avoid any unintended use of the tokens.

* Timing: prelCO will start on 28th July at 17.00 Beijing time and run for 35 days or until reaching
the maximum amount of 300k USD equivalent.

¢ Minimum and maximum amounts for the prelCO are 30k USD and 300k USD equivalent. If we
don’t reach 30k, the contributions will be returned. The prelCO will be closed if/when we receive
300k USD equivalent in contributions.

¢ The coin is called WaBi. Each WaBi will be sold at 0.03 USD during the prelCO and 0.25 USD
during the ICO.

* Token parameters: ERC20 token standard.

* Our prelCO wallet will not have a 3rd party escrow. We are not securing it with a 3rd party due
to relatively small amount of the raise. ICO wallet will be secured by 3rd party escrow and/or
multisignature account.

* Accepted currencies - prelCO : BTC, ETH, LTC. ICO: BTC, ETH.

* Important to note is that we are still having discussions with lawyers on some of the parameters of
the ICO. Hence it is possible that some of the ICO terms may change. At the same time we shall
do our best to minimise the changes and protect the interests of our contributors.

* ICO timing: Starts in November 2017, will last for 30-60 days or until reaching the max. amount.

Decisions on all other documents will be made on a case-by-case basis and will result in delay.
- Selfie of you holding the submitted ID document

¢ White list and Individual cap

We will sell WaBi tokens through a Whitelist with individual caps. Participants who pass KYC will
be added to the Whitelist. An individual cap will be applied on the first day of the ICO. It will be
doubled on day 2 and doubled again on day 3. If not all WaBis are sold by then, we will remove
the caps from day 4 onwards.

¢ Participation restrictions:

investor status. You will need to prove your accredited investor status through a 3rd party vendor

We don’t like to restrict people from participating in our sale but we also need to comply with
relevant regulations and protect the project from any legal risks.

¢ Timing:

- 28th of October - KYC registration opens. Registered users added to Whitelist.
- 21st of November - Whitelist closed

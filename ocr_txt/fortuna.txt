Summary

A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System!, published by Satoshi Nakmoto in 2008,
has brought a whole new mode of thinking about decentralization. With the new mode
of thinking, Fortuna, the first blockchain platform for the global OTC derivatives
market, solves several core problems and introduces some new features as follows:

1. Build a trust network. Fortuna can solve the trust problem of the OTC
derivatives market with consensus algorithm DPOSA, structured smart contract,
decentralized quote scheme, digitalized supervision and other techniques of blockchain.

2. Improve the operational efficiency. As a specialized blockchain platform for
derivatives, Fortuna can improve the operational efficiency of each step of transactions,
including contract creation, price quoting, contract signature, trading and clearing.

3. Increase the liquidity. As the only medium of exchange accepted by Fortuna,
FOTA can enable the platform to embrace the global liquidity pool regardless of the
physical and multi-currency barriers.

4. Motivate users to trade. Fortuna supports two modes of trading: PrC and PuC.
Under PrC mode, users can launch a peer to peer transaction without any cost of agency.
Under PuC mode, users can create new types of derivatives and be the market makers
while benefiting from the trading volume of the new derivatives created.

5. Enrich the derivatives market. Users of Fortuna can create all kinds of
derivatives with different underlying assets, deal structures, durations, margin ratios
and other elements of transactions. To some extent, Fortuna can be a worldwide
incubator for innovative derivative tools.

6. Algorithmic regulation and self-discipline. With algorithmic regulation and
self-discipline, Fortuna supports transparent, real time, and full dose data supervision.
Smart contract, digitalized supervision, arbitration driven by consensus algorithm and
other new technical features can inspire a new mode of regulation and self-discipline.

As Herbert Marshall Mcluhan said, “we shape our tools and afterwards our tools
shape us.” Fortuna will inspire a new mode of thinking for the global OTC derivatives

market and make the tools of hedging more available and more popular.

1. Fortuna

This chapter will analyze the current state of the derivatives market and introduce
the solutions for three core problems of the OTC derivatives market. Moreover, three
dimensional value-added innovations of Fortuna will be introduced and the meaning
of blockchain technology for self-discipline and regulation will be analyzed. Finally,

the business model and the economy design of Fortuna will be detailed in this chapter.

1.1 Current State of OTC Derivatives Market

2010 is called the first year of hedging in China because securities margin trading
and stock index futures were issued in this year, which concluded the age of one-sided
stock market in China. As stock index futures, securities margin trading, Treasury bond
futures, commodity options and other derivatives issued, many companies began the
transition from traditional private equity companies to hedge funds adopting all kinds
of investment strategies including long/short, macro, event driven, CTA, relative value
and others. On the other hand, the volume of Chinese futures market reached 4 billion
and the balance of securities margin financing reached 900 billion RMB. All the signs
show that the derivatives market of China has entered a rapid development period.

Moreover, as the data provided by FIA? shows, Asia has become the biggest market in 2016.

In spite of the high speed of development, the Chinese derivatives market still have
many problems compared with the markets in America and Europe.

1. Exchange Market: lack of derivatives varieties

As the data provided by China Futures Association? shows, there are only four
futures exchanges and only 48 kinds of derivatives in exchange market in the first half
year of 2017. The lack of derivatives varieties restrict the possibilities of more

participation directly, and too many demands on derivatives are not satisfied.

Furthermore, the unbalanced development of exchange market is obvious. For
example, in the first half year of 2017, 5 kinds of derivatives (Steal Rebar, Bitumen,
Zinc, Natural Rubber and Hot Rolled Coils) occupied 81% of total volume of Shanghai
Futures Exchange and the other 9 kinds of derivatives occupied only 19%. Unbalanced
development of exchange market implies that under the surface of rapid development,
the Chinese exchange derivatives market is still not mature.

2. OTC Market: credit risk and efficiency problem

In 2013, China Futures Association issued Guide for Risk Management Service
Carried by Subsidiaries Set up by the Futures Company’. Since then, many futures

company in China began to set up subsidiaries to provide OTC derivatives service to
satisfy the requirements of risk management and price management in many areas. As
OTC derivatives market in China is developing rapidly, the credit risk and trust problem
become the key issue of the OTC market. On the other hand, although many institutions
are trying to build an inter-institution OTC derivatives market, the lack of authoritative
third party institution makes the inter-institution market loose and inefficient.

3. Whole Market: unconnected with the overseas market and insufficient
institutional investors

As FIA2016 Volume Survey” shows, the derivatives exchanges of China performed

well based on the volume dimension.

However, the derivatives market in China are not connected with the international
market very well for many reasons, such as the foreign exchange control policy.
Moreover, the lack of professional institutional investors is another big problem. Since
the first hedge fund was built in 1949, the market size of hedge fund has jumped from
39.8 billion dollars to 3 trillion dollars. America market occupies 70%, Euro market
occupies 20% and Chinese market only occupies 0.5%. The small market share shows

the immature current state and the big room for growth in China.
1.2 Solutions for Three Core Problems

There are four essential symbols of a mature financial market including a large pool
of underlying financial assets, abundant derivatives, global liquidity participation and
efficient regulation. Accompanying with the improving market maturity, the derivatives
and risk management service will be in great demand. However, there are still three core
problems need to be solved:

1. How to build a trust network for OTC derivatives market.

2. How to improve the operational efficiency of OTC derivatives market.

3. How to increase the liquidity of OTC derivatives market.

1.2.1 Build a Trust Network

The trust problem and credit risk not only restrict the participation, but also limit
the pool of liquidity. The difficulties to build trust within OTC derivatives market lead
to three structural features of the OTC derivatives market as follows.

1. The majority of participants are big intuitions with good credit records. The
participation of small enterprises and individuals are rare.

2.The nominal amount of single OTC derivative contract is very big in general and
the duration of the contract is very long in general.

3. The variety of OTC derivatives are not developed very well.

The third problem seems to be strange because one of the advantages of OTC
derivatives market is the feature of supporting personalized contract. However, the
credit risk and the trust problem result in the prudent participation of investors especially
when the traders fall under different jurisdiction. Therefore, the participants are not
willing to take extra risk with personalized derivative contracts which may have
complex deal structure and new underlying asset-class. As the data provided by BIS®
shows, the notional principal reached 48.3 trillion dollars in 2016. The market share of

currency derivatives (interest rate and FX derivatives) are more than 90%.

+ At half-year end (end-June and end-December). Amounts denominated in currencies other than the US dollar are converted to US dollars
at the exchange rate prevailing on the reference date.

The reasons of the trust problem within OTC derivatives market are as follows.

1. The participants of the OTC derivatives market come from different areas, such
as finance, agriculture, manufacturing, etc.

2. The regulation and self-discipline mechanism is not mature and complete.

3. Traditional offline signature of contract will easily lead to disputation.

4. Lack of default management mechanism without delay and human intervention.

The reasons described above turn out to be the trust problem of the OTC derivatives
market which cannot be solved easily in traditional ways. Fortuna introduces a whole
new way to solve this problem based on blockchain technology as follows.

1. Consensus Algorithm. Fortuna introduces an optimized version of consensus
algorithm based on DPOS, which is called DPOSA to safeguard the data’s integrity and
guarantee that it cannot be tampered with. As long as the malicious entities or nodes are
no more than one third of the total number, there will be no fork and moral hazard.

2. Smart Contract. Fortuna replaces the traditional offline contract signature mode
with programmable and automatic executable smart contract based on the blockchain to
eliminate the credit risk of derivatives trading activities.

3. Digitalized Supervision. Fortuna introduces a new kind of crypto-token FOTA
to unify the exchange media on the platform. All the participants from different areas

and jurisdiction will trade derivatives using FOTA. The FOTA in margin account will

6
be supervised for 7*24 hour and no human being can intervene. The digitalized
supervision mode based on crypto-token are much more efficient and transparent
compared with the traditional supervision mode carried by commercial banks.

4. Decentralized Quote Scheme. Fortuna creates a decentralized scheme for price
quoting while introducing a mechanism similar to corporate equity governance to
motivate the quoters to fulfill their duties and eliminate the possibilities of price
manipulation.

5. Arbitration Carried by Whole Network. If a trading node disagrees with the
execution result of derivative contracts, it can apply for the arbitration carried by the
whole network which can safeguard the equity of Fortuna.

6. Lifelong Credit Record. Every node on Fortuna will have a lifelong credit
record based on blockchain which can ensure the transparency, integrity and safety of
the credit records.

7. Self-disciplined by Algorithm. Fortuna is an ecological decentralized platform
which consists of five functional roles including CoT maker, Trader, Quoter, Marker
Maker and Delegate. All the definition, motivation and restriction setting of the five
roles of Fortuna are based on algorithm instead of the rules on paper which can ensure
the execution and the efficiency of self-discipline of the whole network.

In conclusion, Fortuna will build a trust network for OTC derivatives market with
consensus algorithm, smart contract, digitalized supervision, decentralized quote
scheme, whole network arbitration, lifelong credit record, algorithmic self-discipline

and other technical features.

1.2.2 Improve Operational Efficiency

Other than the credit risk and trust problem, the low operational efficiency of the
OTC derivatives market is another core problem. For example, the process of OTC
option transaction has 7 steps at least and requires manual operations in many steps,

which turns out to be an inefficient process.
The Process of OTC Option Transaction

Requirement Analysis
OTC Option Design
Price Quoting among Institutions
Main Contract Signature
Transaction Elements Confirm
Signature of Confirmation Letter

Settlement of Option Transaction

Therefore, one of the core problems of OTC derivatives market is the operational
efficiency problem. Fortuna introduces a blockchain-based solution for this problem.

1. Contract Creation and Signature. Fortuna introduces structured smart contract
which is optimized to meet the demand of operational efficiency. There are three layers
of the smart contract: main contract, contract template and contract. Lower layer of
contract will inherit all the clauses of the contract in higher layer and each layer will set
up their own class of clauses. Structured smart contract will improve the efficiency of
the contract creation and signature step.

2. Quote Broadcast on Blockchain. Fortuna replaces the traditional way of price
quoting, which requires contact with every potential counterparty one by one through
telephone or email, with broadcast on blockchain which can help to reduce the cost of
communication and the response time. Moreover, the credit record of the trading node
will be attached to the broadcast information which can improve the efficiency of
transaction further.

3. Automatic Settlement with Smart Contract. Fortuna utilizes the technical
features of smart contract to improve the efficiency of transaction settlement step.
Replacing manual settlement with programmable and automatic executable smart
contract will shorten the time and reduce the potential errors.

4. Data Supervision on Blockchain. Fortuna utilizes the technical features of

8
blockchain and decentralized network to improve the quality and efficiency of data
supervision. For example, with Fortuna, there is no need for the regulator to send audit
requirements to each institution while worrying about the quality, timeliness and
veracity of data sent by institutions.

In conclusion, Fortuna will improve the efficiency and quality of the work such as
contract creation and signature, price quoting, transaction settlement and data
supervision based on the technical features of blockchain and the optimization of smart

contract technology.

1.2.3 Increase the Liquidity

The third core problem of OTC derivatives market is the liquidity problem due to
three factors as follows.

1. The foreign exchange control policy restricted the connection between Chinese
market and international market.

2. The personalized contract is hard for secondary trading in nature.

3. The lack of trust limited the number of participants which restrict the liquidity
of the whole OTC derivatives market.

Fortuna introduces a solution for this problem based on blockchain technology.

1. Unify the Exchange Media with Crypto-token FOTA. Fortuna introduces a
new kind of crypto which is called FOTA to unify the exchange media on the platform.
All the participants around the world should trade derivatives using FOTA on Fortuna
regardless of the physical and multi-currency barriers.

2. Support PrC and PuC Trading Mode. Fortuna not only introduces a structured
smart contract with three layers, but also supports two kinds of trading mode: PrC and
PuC. PrC Mode will enable every trading node of Fortuna to launch a peer-to-peer
derivative transaction without any cost of agency. PuC Mode offer opportunities for
every node of Fortuna to be a market maker and create a new market for a new type of
derivative which can bring profit for the creator related to the trading volume of the new
derivative contract. PuC is similar to the standardized contracts traded in exchanges

which have better liquidity. The biggest difference between PuC and the exchange-
9
traded contract is that the exchange-traded contract is designed and issued by exchange,
but on Fortuna, every node could design and issue any kinds of derivative contract on

their demand.

1.3 Three Dimensional Innovations

Other than providing solutions for the three core problems of OTC derivatives
market, Fortuna can also make a difference through three dimensional innovations for
OTC derivatives market as follows.

1. Support more precise and specific derivatives on a smaller granularity level.

2. Support new class of underlying assets.

3. Support more participants to utilize hedging as a scientific risk management tool.

1.3.1 Smaller Granularity Level

The majority of the derivatives are designed for the majority of the participants.
However, many investors need some derivatives on smaller granularity level to manage
their risk more precise and more specifically. For example, S&P 500 index futures are
good for majority of the investors, but there are still a lot of demand on making S&P
500 a smaller index so that investors can take more targeted hedging strategy to manage
the risk of their portfolios.

Furthermore, the factors that can affect the price of underlying assets are abundant
and investors may have more precise prediction and analysis on these single factor rather
than the price of the underlying asset. For example, a company occupied in international
trade between China and America. The CEO of the company predicted that Trump
would be the president of U.S. and he believed that the result could affect the foreign
exchange rates and the international trades. However, the only way he could manage the
risk in the finical market is to trade foreign exchange derivatives to hedge the risk, but
there are some problems with this way.

First of all, the reaction chain is too long. Take the international trade company as
an example, the result of the presidential election can determine whether Trump has the

right to name a new chairman of Fed. The new chairman of Fed can affect the monetary
10
policy which can impact the foreign exchange rate further. The reaction chain is too long
which leads to a lower precision of hedging.

Second, other than the presidential election, there are too many factors affecting
the foreign exchange which means even if the CEO predicts the election result correctly,
he may not benefit from the derivatives trading in the financial market.

Third, the presidential election will not only affect the foreign exchange but also
the tariff policy and other policies that will affect the international trades between China
and America. The CEO can trade the foreign exchange derivatives to hedge the risk for
the assets accumulated in history. However, there is no vehicles in traditional market for
him to hedge the risk of the whole business of international trades in the future.

As for the three problems described above, Fortuna supports new types of
derivatives on a smaller granularity level which can enable investors or hedgers to trade
derivatives on single factor such as the monetary policy, tariff policy, presidential
election, etc. New type of derivatives on a smaller granularity level will be a new way

for investors to hedge the risk more precisely.

1.3.2 New Underlying Assets

The majority of traditional underlying assets of derivatives are commodity and
financial securities. However, as all kinds of areas permeated with internet and
technique, there are many new classes of assets coming into being and the derivatives
for the risk management will definitely be developed afterwards.

For example, thousands of crypto-tokens around the world based on blockchain
technology has been popular for several years. There is a great demand on the
derivatives for the crypto-tokens. Actually, the CME has just announced that it will
publish the BTC futures officially.

For example, micro-amount consumer finance through the internet is developing
rapidly in the last few years around the world. The derivatives for the credit assets
accumulated by those internet consumer finance companies are necessary and important.

As the new technology developed, there will be more and more scenarios and cases

just like the examples above. The derivatives and risk management will be on great
11
demand in those areas afterwards. And Fortuna will enable every node throughout the
blockchain to create new types of derivatives with new types of underlying assets which

will make the OTC derivatives market a whole new market in the future.

1.3.3 Higher Availability of Hedging

Traditional derivatives markets are not friendly to many investors for two reasons
as follows.

First of all, high threshold of financial knowledge. The majority of investors are
not familiar with the derivatives market because of the complex deal structures and
professional terms. However, the demand for risk management shows everywhere for
every investor even if they don’t realize and being blocked by the high threshold of
financial knowledge.

Second, high requirement of initial deposit. Take the stock index futures of China
as an example, the initial account deposit requirement is 500,000 RMB which turns out
to be a high requirement for the majority of investors in China. Although a high
requirement of initial deposit is an effective way to protect the investors by blocking
them out, there will be another way to protect the investors while enabling them to utilize
the derivatives to hedge their risk.

As for the higher threshold of financial knowledge and initial deposit, Fortuna
supports more friendly vehicles for risk management through lowering the requirement
of initial deposit, simplifying the deal structure, standardizing contract clauses,
introducing new asset class and other effective means. Fortuna can make more and more

investors know and get used to hedging for risk management.

1.4 Blockchain for Supervision

A sophisticated regulation system and self-discipline mechanism is a necessary
condition for mature financial market. As a new technology, blockchain could provide
a whole new way for supervision.

1. Build a self-disciplined community based on blockchain. Fortuna creates an

ecosystem with five functional roles including CoT Maker, Trader, Quoter, Market
12
Maker and Delegate. The ecosystem is balanced through role definition, interaction and
motivation design which is based on FOTA as a tool for punishment and reward.
Furthermore, the whole self-disciplined mechanism is programmable and automatic
executable based on algorithm.

2. Data supervision. Fortuna supports transparent, real time, and full dose trading
data supervision based on blockchain. Moreover, there is no need for regulation
department to send audit and data requirement to each institution and worrying about
the quality, timeliness and accuracy of the data provided by different institutions.
Fortuna can create a new approach to improve the quality and efficiency of data
supervision of OTC derivatives market.

3. Inspiration for regulation. The new features of structured smart contract,
digitalized trading fund supervision, arbitration driven by consensus algorithm and other
core features of Fortuna could bring a lot of inspirations for the current regulation
scheme of OTC derivatives market.

4. Lifelong credit record. Based on blockchain technology, Fortuna will record
every node’s behavior information including price quoting, contract execution, default,
arbitration, etc. The credit record will be safeguarded, lifelong and transparent to the
whole blockchain.

Fortuna will utilize and optimize the core technical features of blockchain to offer
tools and inspirations for the regulation and self-discipline mechanism for OTC

derivatives market.

1.5 Economic Model of Fortuna

First and foremost, as an open source project based on blockchain, Fortuna is
owned by every nodes of the chain. Moreover, Fortuna will not charge any nodes for
any kinds of fee and all the potential fee will be charged by nodes offering different
kinds of services. Fortuna will introduce a utility-based crypto token, FOTA, which will
be used as the exchange media for the derivatives trading. The total amount of FOTA
will be 1 billion.

For example, there is a Contract Template created by a CoT maker and the CoT set
13
its transaction fee standard. All the transaction fee from the concreate contracts

produced by this CoT will be distributed to three type of serving nodes:

Node Type Description

CoT maker could benefit from the commission of the contract

CoT Maker
created and traded under the CoT ( Contract Template ) .

Quoter on Fortuna will get FOTA based on their shares of quoter
Quoter
corporation providing price quoting service for trading activities.

101 delegates elected by whole network each round based on

DPOSA consensus algorithm will get a certain percentile of the
Delegate
commission from the contract stored in the blocks which is produced

by delegates.

Moreover, there are many kinds of roles on Fortuna could make profit through the
decentralized platform and this all-win mechanism design would be beneficial for the

sustainable development of Fortuna.

Roles Sources of Profit

Fortuna will newly issue 1% of whole FOTA as a reward for all
Delegate
the delegates producing blocks to store data.

Under the PuC trading mode, every node could be a market
Market Maker
maker to earn the bid-ask spread in FOTA.

FVLS nodes will provide FOTA value locking service for the

trading nodes to ensure that the FOTA value compared with other

FVLS crypto-tokens or currencies will be the same during the contract
period. FVLS will be a good tool for risk management and FVLS

nodes will charge for it.

2. Technology

This chapter will introduce the architecture of Fortuna and the details of four
layers including bottom layer, core component layer, platform service component
layer and application layer. Moreover, the structured smart contract, multi-roles
definition, decentralized quote scheme and the life cycle of PrC/PuC contracts are
detailed. DPOSA is discussed as an optimized version of DPOS consensus algorithm.
The meaning of FVLS is analyzed and the compliance filtering scheme is given in

the last part.

2.1.1 Bottom Layer

There are many advantages of building an application based on existing blockchain,
15
such as lowering the technical threshold, improving developing efficiency, automatic
iteration, etc. However, Fortuna still choose to build a complete blockchain from scratch
because an optimized and independent blockchain will be more appropriate for the

global OTC derivatives market which needs eight core features at least as follows.

2.1.2 Core Component Layer

The core component layer of Fortuna consists of structured smart contract, role
definition and decentralized quote scheme.

1. Structured Smart Contract

In order to meet the special requirements of OTC derivatives market, Fortuna
introduces structured smart contract with three layers including main contract layer, CoT
(contract template) layer and contract layer. The structured smart contract design can
improve the operational efficiency for contract creation, matching, signature and
clearing by reducing the repetitive work. Moreover, there are two kinds of contract at
the contract layer: PrC (Private Contract) and PuC (Public Contract). PrC trading mode

will enable every user of Fortuna to launch a peer-to-peer derivative contract transaction
16
without any transaction cost. PuC trading mode offers opportunities for every user of
Fortuna to be a market maker and create a new market for a new type of derivative
which can bring profit for the creator related to the trading volume of the new derivative.

2. Role Definition and Interaction Design

Fortuna builds a healthy ecosystem through the role definition and interaction
design. There are five functional roles of Fortuna which are CoT maker, Trader, Quoter,
Market Maker and Delegate. Based on the motivation design with FOTA and the
cooperation mechanism design of the five roles, the decentralized system for OTC
derivative market can develop in a healthy and sustainable way.

3. Decentralized Quote Scheme

As a decentralized network for OTC derivatives market based on blockchain
technology, Fortuna needs to support price quoting service which can provide the price
of underlying assets for settlement and clearing of derivatives contracts. All the nodes
on Fortuna can be a quoter node after the QNS (Quote Name Service) verification. Every
quoter needs to be a member of a QC (Quote Corporation) in order to provide the price
quoting service of some kinds of underlying assets. Every quoter has equities of a QC
and will benefit from the profit of QC based on the equities owned. Moreover, an equity
redistribution mechanism is introduced for motivating all the quoter nodes to fulfill their

duties and prohibiting the exit scam’ risk.
2.1.3 Platform Service Layer

1. CoT Creation

All the nodes on Fortuna can create its own CoT (contract template) and the CoT
needs to confirm the underlying asset, deal structure and other elements of transaction.
A CoT creator needs to deposit some FOTA to guarantee that it will not do something
that is harmful for other nodes and the whole platform, such as creating a lot of useless
CoT. A CoT creator will benefit from the commission related to the trading volume of
the contracts under the CoT.

2. PrC Trading

Fortuna introduces a PrC (Private Contract) trading mode which will enable every
17
user of Fortuna to launch a peer-to-peer derivative transaction without any cost of
agency. A PrC should define the settlement time, delivery price, margin ratio, price of
derivative, short or long position and other elements of transaction.

3. PuC Trading

Fortuna introduces a PuC (Public Contract) trading mode which can offer
opportunities for every user of Fortuna to be a market maker and create a new market
for a new type of derivative contract which can bring profit for the creator related to the
trading volume of the new contract. A PuC should define the settlement time, delivery
price, margin ratio, price of derivative, market maker and other elements of transaction.

4. Market Making

A PuC will choose a node to be the market maker for itself and the market maker
can earn the bid-ask spread from the market making activities. On the other hand, a
market maker needs to deposit some FOTA to guarantee that it can provide liquidity for
the market.

5. Price Quoting

A lot of Quote Corporations will provide price quoting service of underlying assets
for the settlement of derivatives transaction in OTC market and will charge for service.
All the quoters of a quoter corporation will benefit from the whole profit of the
corporation based on the equities owned by quoters.

6. FVLS

As a decentralized platform for hedging, the most important meaning of Fortuna is
help investors to manage the risk of their portfolio. FOTA, as the only exchange medium
of Fortuna, can help Fortuna to embrace the international liquidity regardless of physical
and multi-currency barriers. However, the fluctuation of the value of FOTA will post a
negative influence on the efficiency of risk management which will damage the meaning
of hedging. Therefore, Fortuna introduces a kind of service which is called FVLS (FOTA
value locking service). FVLS can help users to trade derivatives without the influence

of the fluctuation of FOTA value and Fortuna will charge for FLVS at a reasonable level.

18
2.1.4 Application Layer

In order to provide great user experience, Fortuna will publish different versions of
wallet and platform for PC, web and mobile phones to satisfy users’ requirements about
security, efficiency and availability. In addition, a light application allows users only
need to download the head of the block instead of the whole block while supporting
secure block access for user to create a CoT/PrC/PuC and trade the derivatives on

Fortuna.

2.2 Fortuna Ecosystem

The whole ecosystem of Fortuna is as follows.

Quote Scheme Delegate

The whole ecosystem of Fortuna is built on Fortuna blockchain and three core
components including structured smart contract, decentralized quote scheme, role
definition and interaction design.

A CoT Maker can create all kinds of contract templates under the unified main
contract. The CoT created will define the underlying asset, the deal structure and the
chosen Quote Corporation. A Contract Trader can create a PrC and search for the
counterparty to trade. Alternatively, a Contract Trader can create a PuC under a CoT to

launch long or short trading activities with other nodes. A Quoter of a Quote Corporation
19
can provide price quoting service for one kind of underlying asset and the quoted price
would be the basis for settlement of transactions. A Market Maker will provide liquidity
for the PuC and the delegates elected by DPOSA consensus algorithm will produce
blocks for storing data. Fortuna will develop in a healthy and sustainable way through
the cooperation of all the roles and the motivation design based on FOTA as the

punishment or reward.

2.3 Structured Smart Contract

The structured smart contract of Fortuna is as follows.

Fortuna Main Contract

rerfrc] maf

1. Fortuna Main Contract

The Fortuna Main Contract is the only main contract accepted by Fortuna and the
clauses are similar to the main contract of NAFMII, SAC and other self-regulatory
organization for OTC derivatives. Every trader on Fortuna will sign the main contract
before they start trading activities and will come to an agreement about the constitution
of contracts, efficacy level of contracts, duty of payment and delivery, definition of
default, default management, definition of termination, interest, compensation, expense,
arbitration and other non-transactional elements.

2. Contract Template

A Contract Template is called CoT and all the users of Fortuna can create their own
CoT with different underlying assets (commodities, currencies, bonds, stocks, credit

assets, crypto-tokens, events, etc.), deal structures (forwards, swaptions, American
Options, European Options, LMSR?®, etc.), restrictive clauses and other core elements
of transactions. Every CoT can produce a lot of contracts.

20
3. PrC

A Private Contract is called PrC and a PrC is a kind of derivative contract which is
appropriate for peer to peer trading mode. PrC will inherit all the clauses of the
corresponding CoT and will define the settlement time, delivery price, margin ratio,
contract price, short/long direction and other elements of transaction. PrC has
disadvantages of liquidity and matching efficiency, but it has the advantages of peer to
peer trading and lower cost of agencies.

4. PuC

A Public Contract is called PuC and a PuC is a kind of derivative contract which is
appropriate for N to N trading mode requiring the participation of market makers. The
creator of the corresponding CoT is the market maker in default unless the creator
choose another node to be the market maker for the PuC under the CoT. PuC will inherit
all the clauses of the corresponding CoT and will define the settlement time, delivery
price, margin ratio, contract price and other elements of transactions. PuC is very similar
to the contracts traded in the derivatives exchange. However, the biggest difference
between them is that the standardized contracts traded in exchange is designed and
published by exchanges and no users can make changes. On the contrary, PuC are
designed and created by users of Fortuna. Another big difference is that the commission
of the standardized contracts traded in exchange is all for the exchanges while the
commission of PuC will all belong to the CoT Creators. Therefore, although the PuC
has the feature of great liquidity with market making, the PuC is a new type of derivative

contract compared with the contracts traded at exchanges.

2.4 Role Definition

Five kinds of roles of Fortuna are as follows.

1. CoT Maker

¢ All the users could create their own CoT while defining the deal structure and
underlying assets at liberty.

¢ ACoT Maker needs to assign a quote corporation to provide the price quoting

service of the chosen underlying asset.
21
¢ ACoT Maker will benefit from the trading volume of the contracts under the
CoT. This kind of mechanism will motivate CoT Maker nodes to create reasonable and
popular CoT to gain more profits.

¢ ACoT Maker needs to deposit a certain amount of FOTA to guarantee that it
will not damage the ecosystem of Fortuna, such as creating a lot of useless CoT.

2. Contract Trader

¢ All the users with FOTA can trade all kinds of derivatives on Fortuna to
manage the risk of portfolio.

¢ All the users can choose a CoT and create a corresponding PrC or PuC to
define all kinds of elements of transaction.

¢ All the users can trade with other users at a trust network based on blockchain
technology.

¢ All the contract traders should deposit a certain amount of FOTA according to
the margin ratio required by contracts.

3. Price Quoter

¢ All the users can apply to be a Quoter.

¢ Anode can be a quoter only if it can pass the QNS verification (Quote Name
Service, verify the efficiency of the interface provided by the quoter node for price
quoting).

¢ A quoter node must attend at least one Quote Corporation to start providing
price quoting services and pay a certain amount of FOTA for the equities of Quote
Corporation.

¢ All the contracts will invoke a price quoting service provided by a Quote
Corporation and a Quote Corporation will produce a Quote Matrix to calculate the final
result through the SVD consensus algorithm.

¢ A Quoter will gain its proportion of profits of the corresponding Quote
Corporation based on the equities owned.

¢ The equities of a Quote Corporation will redistribute based on the behaviors

of the quoters of this Quote Corporation.

22
¢ A Quoter can sell its equities back to the corresponding Quote Corporation for
FOTA when the quoter quit.

4. Market Maker

¢ Provides market making service for a PuC and needs to deposit a certain
amount of FOTA as a margin.

¢ Market Maker makes profits through the bid-ask spread of market making.

¢ The creator of the corresponding CoT will be market maker in default.

5. Delegate

¢ Adelegate can produce blocks as well as keep trading records. For each block
produced, the delegate will be rewarded with a certain amount of FOTA.

¢ There are a total of 101 delegates in the whole network, which are elected
based on the DPOSA algorithm.

¢ Until the contracts and quotes are written into the block, a delegate cannot view

their contents.

2.5 Decentralized Quoting Scheme

The Quoting mechanism, a mechanism providing the current market price of
underlying assets, needs to minimize risks from malicious entities and provide adequate
incentives for quoters to post high-quality quotes at the same time. Fortuna is equipped
with an SVD-based decentralized quoting mechanism that can prevent market
manipulation from a small number of malicious entities in an effective way. In the
meantime, it introduces “Quote Corporation”, which uses an incentive scheme that is
analogous to corporate governance and equity redistribution, motivating quoters to

provide high-quality quotes continuously. The detail mechanism is described below:

2.5.1 The Overall Scheme

new Quoter

1. Joining a Quote Corporation

Every node in the network can become a quoter once certified by QNS (Quote
Name Service). A quoter needs to join one or more Quote Corporation (QC) before it
can post any quotes. A quoter can query the FQCT catalogue to find and join QCs that
match the category of quoting services it provides. If no such QC exists, a QC of the
new category will be automatically created.

2. Quote Corporation provide quoting services

In a certain cycle, when multiple smart contracts that using the same QC’s quoting

24
service matures, the quoters in this QC will provide independent quotes. The QC will
compile a quote matrix using all the quotes provided for each underlying asset by all the
quoters and obtain a consensus price using the SVD consensus algorithm. This
consensus price will be used for contract fulfillment. The details of the SVD consensus
algorithm will be described in later sections.

3. Dynamic redistribution of Quote Corporation equity

After each cycle, the consensus algorithm will determine the consensus quote as
well as every quoter’s impact weight in this cycle, which is used as an indicator of the
quality of its quotes. Then the QC will set aside a certain amount of equity as to
redistribute among all quoters according to their impact weights, motivating them to
provide high-quality quotes actively. This equity redistribution mechanism will be

detailed in later sections.

2.5.2 SVD-Based Consensus Algorithm

In each cycle, for a quote corporation that has n quoters and m underlying assets, a
n by m quote matrix will be constructed by collecting all the quotes posted by every
quoter for every underlying asset. The quote matrix is illustrated below.

Share of QC = { S$° Se S$}

QC : a Quote Corporation

Q,, : the quotes provided by the x-th quoter

E,, : the quotes received by the y-th underlying asset
se © + the equity share possessed by the x-th quoter
CoT,, : the k-th contract template

In the quote matrix above, each row corresponds to the quotes provided by a quoter
to the m underlying assets and each column corresponds to the quotes received by the n
quoters for an underlying asset. An SVD algorithm is applied on the quote matrix Qnxm

to determine the consensus quotes and the impact weight of each quoter as follows.
Assume that there are k eigenvalues of Qnxm , A, represents the k-th eigenvalues,
X, represents the k-th column of Qyxm:
QnxmX1 = AV%1
QnxmX2 = A2X2

QnxmX3 = 3X3

QnxmXk = AnXk

Then we can have:

Qnxm'U = U-A
Then we can calculate the eigen decomposition of Qyxm:
Quem = U:A+U- =U-A-UT
Assume there is a group of orthogonal basis {v1, V2, 3 ... Vn}:

T
QnxmVi * QnxmYj = (Qnxm¥i)" * QnxmYj = v7 Quxm * Qnxmvj = 0
26
Which means v;" -v; = vj, vj = 0
Then

Uj

So we can have

QaxmlY1 V2 V3 VilVieer Un] = [Uy Uz U UplU ... Un]
Finally

Qnxm = UEZV*
As
SVD(Qnxm) = Umxm X Zmxn X Vaxn

We can have

dmx1 = U, we take the first row of U

Centralize Qnxm Which means calculate the mean value of each column of Qyxm

Hnxm = Inxa* MEAN xm(Qnxm)

norm —
Vim” = Qnxm — Unxm
— norm
Cnxi = Vaxm” X dmx1

After normalization, each item of Cy is positive and the weighed sum equals 1.
— lal
“Ya
Finally we can get Ny which is the weight of the current result of Qy.
Based on this, we can get the consensus quotes of a Quote Matrix Qnym for the

settlement of transactions.

2.5.3 QC Equity Governance and Redistribution

QC equity can be bought by a quoter upon joining a QC. Correspondingly, it can
also be sold upon exiting a QC. However, in order to ensure its integrity of an incentive
for providing high-quality quotes, no QC equity is allowed to be traded between quoters.

The only channel for it to flow between quoters is through the dynamic redistribution

27
after each cycle, which is based on the quality and frequency of the quotes provided by
each quoter — a quoter with better performance will be rewarded with more equity.

Below are the detailed rules for the redistribution:

Quote Corporation Updated Status for Ey

Ne = NS 44
ce’ = Ce 4M

SPO" = SP" x (100% — 52°)
SEO" = SE" x (100% — 52°)
SAE = 5% x (100% — 52°)
Quote Corporation Updated Status for Cz
Nec’ = Ne
Ce! = Ce

se = s%€ x (100% — 6) +W7 x @

C2" = C& x (100% — SP°)
Seo" =0
SLO" = SP" = (100% — SP)
SPO = SY° + (100% — SP)
SRO" = SE° + (100% — 52°)

QC : a quote corporation

28
Ex : quoter X joins the QC

Oy : quoter Y exits the QC

Cz : the Z-th cycle of the consensus algorithm

M : the amount FOTA that needs to be paid to join the QC

N®&¢ : the number of quoters in the QC before the update

NC’ : the number of quoters in the QC after the update

C2° : the total amount of funds in the QC before the update

C2’ : the total amount of funds in the QC after the update

Ss 2 © : the fraction of equity shares possessed by quoter X before the update
Ss 2 ©": the fraction of equity shares possessed by quoter X after the update
® : the fraction of equity shares used for redistribution after each cycle

W# : the impact weight of quoter X after the Z-th cycle

Below is a case example to help illustrate the rules described above:

Suppose M = 1000FOT and © = 20%

1. Quoter A paid 1000 FOTA to set up a new QC for a certain category of
underlying assets. And it owns 100% of the QC’s equity shares.

2. Quoter B paid 1000 FOTA to join the QC. Quoters A and B now each owns 50%
of total equity shares.

3. Quoter C paid 1000 FOTA to join and quoters A, B and C each owns one third
of the total shares.

4. Quoter D also paid 1000 FOTA to join. Now A, B, C and D each owns 25% of
the total shares.

5. Suppose at the end of cycle, quoters A, B,C and D ended up with impact weights
of 40%, 30%, 20% and 10%, respectively. After the redistribution, their equity share
percentages became 25%x(1-20%)+20%x40%=28% , 25 %x(1-20%)+20% x30%=26% ,

25%x(1-20%)+20%x20%=24% and 25%x(1-20%)+20% x 10% =22%.
29
6. Quoter A exits the QC. Upon the exit, all of its equity shares would be bought

back by the QC. Because the QC had a total fund of 4000 FOTA (paid by A, B, C and
D upon their entry), the shares of A would be sold for 4000 28% = 1120 FOTA. These

shares would be released to quoters B, C and D proportionally. In the end, the fraction

of equity shares owned by B, C and D would be 36%, 33% and 31%.

2.5.4 Continuous Quoting and Close Out Alert

There are two types of quotes that a quoter can provide in terms of the contract
trading structure: discrete and continuous. Under certain trading structure, the trading
contract requires continuous quoting service in order to monitor the deposit accounts of
both parties in real time and issue alert when they need close out. Therefore, Fortuna
will rigorously scrutinize quoters who provide continuous quoting services to make sure
they can provide robust and continuous services continuously. See the details in the

figure below:

' Z
Day 1 ' | Day N

'
'
'

i ' message closing transaction
‘ ' send @
i 7
price polling
j price
collin: | | lert | | }
| P g ater update

register | detecting | | close out |

A quoter who provides continuous quoting/close out/alert services needs to closely
monitor if there is any active contract that requires alert/close out. Let us call such a

quoter QX. Below is how QX functions:

30
1. QX provides various types of continuous real-time services including
registration, notification, real-time inquiry, close out check, etc;

2. QX will check if the current block contains deals that need to be alerted for close
out and write them into the local contract list;

3. QX node will inquire third-party prices in real-time and compare with the alerted
close out prices in the local contracts. If the alert/close out condition applies, the
alert/close out will be executed immediately;

4. The deposit requirement can dramatically increase the cost of malicious

activities and potentially minimize them.

2.6 Contract Life Cycle

Depending on their types, contracts have different life cycles. This section will

describe the life cycles of PrC and PuC in detail.

2.6.1 Life Cycle of Prc

PrC is useful for 1 to 1 or 1 to N customized contracts, its life cycle is shown in the

picture below:

Phase I : CoT Created |

Phase II : PrC Created

Phase III : Broadcast

Phase IV : PrC Signed
Phase V : Quote

Phase VI : Audit

Phase VI : Clearing

Phase VII : PrC Mature

1. CoT Created: A contract template is created by the CoT maker, specifying the
anchored underlying assets, deal structure and quote corporation. The template is

submitted and will be written into a block. Until then, the template is be invisible.
31
2.PrC Created: Based on the template, a trader will create a concrete PrC, which
defines various key elements of the deal such as the delivery time, deal price, unit,
deposit percentage, contract price, trading direction, etc. The contract is submitted and
written into a block. Until then, the contract is invisible, which is similar to creating a

PrC contract template. Please see the figure below for illustration.

3. Broadcast: Inquiry and quoting are done by broadcasting over the whole

network. Parties who are interested in the contract will respond to the broadcast. Inquiry
will be broadcasted if the trading direction is specified as “buy-in” and quoting will be
broadcasted if the trading direction is specified as “sell-out”.

4. PrC Signed: A party responds to the broadcast and signs the contract with its
creator. Then both parties pay a certain amount of contract fee as well as deposits, which
enacts the contract effectively.

5. Quote: Upon the delivery date specified in the PrC contract, the contract will
utilize the quote corporation specified in its template and inquires the price for the
corresponding underlying assets. The quote corporation will determine a consensus

result based on the SVD algorithm and provide it for the contract fulfillment.

32
6. Audit: Both parties of the deal needs to confirm and agree on the contract
fulfillment conditions. If either party refuses the conditions, it can request for an audit
by all the nodes in the network. In this case, price inquiry will be done by all the nodes
instead of the QC. Note that, the party who requested the audit will pay a certain amount
of audit fee. However, if the audit is successful, the audit fee will be covered by the QC.

7. Clearing: After both parties confirmed the contract fulfillment conditions, they
will clear the deal by paying off their balances. The deposits will be refunded to them
after that.

8. PrC Mature: Upon the clearing, the contract finishes its life cycle. In the
meantime, Fortuna will keep a record of the behaviors of all relevant entities of this

contract, which can be used to construct a credit database.

2.6.2 Life Cycle of PuC

PuC contracts are useful for N to N risk hedging deals and require market makers
in the deal. Their life cycles are very similar to those of PrC contracts, with some
differences in the 3rd and 4th phases. The 3rd and 4th phases of a PrC are broadcasting
of inquiry/quoting and contract signing which are suitable for direct signing the | to 1
or | to N customized contracts. However, the 3rd and 4th phases of a PuC provide initial
liquidity of market makers and open the floor for whole network trading, which is

essentially an N to N market maker trading mode.

Phase I : CoT Created |

Phase II : PuC Created

Phase III : Market Making

Phase IV : Trading
Phase V : Quote

Phase VI : Audit

Phase VI : Clearing

Phase VI : PuC Mature

33

1. CoT Created: A contract template is created by the CoT maker, specifying the
anchored underlying assets, deal structure and quote corporation. The template is
submitted and will be written into a block. Until then, the template will be invisible.

2. PuC Created: Based on the template, a trader will create a concrete PuC, which
defines various key elements of the deal such as the delivery time, deal price, unit,
deposit percentage, contract price, trading direction, etc. This contract will also specify
its market maker (it will be the creator of the contract by default).The contract is
submitted and written into a block. Until then, the contract is invisible.

3. Market Making: The market maker designated by the PuC pays the liquidity
deposit and provide market making service for the deals specified in the PuC. The
market maker needs to refill the deposit account once its balance is too low. The market
maker can earn profit through the ask-bid spread of market making activities.

4. Trading: Any user with FOTA on the platform can participate in the trading
specified by the PuC. To participate, a user needs to pay certain amount of deposit and
transaction fee. The main difference between the life cycles of PuC and PrC contracts
lies in the market making and trading phases. The former follows the market maker
trading mode, in which all users can participate in the trading with market makers; the
latter uses whole network broadcasting for quoting and inquiry. Once two parties are
matched during the broadcasting, a 1-to-1 customized contract will be signed between

them. This difference is illustrated in the figure below:

5. Quote: Upon the delivery date specified in the PuC contract, the contract will
utilize the quote corporation specified in its template and inquires the price for the
corresponding underlying assets. The quote corporation will determine a consensus
result based on the SVD algorithm and provide it for the contract fulfillment.

6. Audit: Both parties of the deal needs to confirm and agree on the contract
fulfillment conditions. If either party refuses the conditions, it can request for an audit
by all the nodes in the network. In this case, price inquiry will be done by all the nodes
instead of the QC. Note that, the party who requested the audit will pay a certain amount
of audit fee. However, if the audit is successful, the audit fee will be covered by the QC.

7. Clearing: After both parties confirmed the contract fulfillment conditions, they
will clear the deal by paying off their balances. The deposits will be refunded to them
after that.

8. PuC Mature: Upon the clearing, the contract finishes its life cycle. In the
meantime, Fortuna will keep a record of the behaviors of all relevant entities of this

contract, which can be used to construct a credit database.

2.7 DPOSA Consensus Algorithm

To ensure the security and orderliness of the whole block chain, a block can only
be generated upon certain consensus. The consensus algorithm is one of the key
elements of a block chain. In terms of the choice of the consensus algorithms, block
chains face the same challenge of all distributed systems - the CAP" principle, i.e., only
two of the three following properties can be achieved at the same time: Consistency,
Availability and Partition-Tolerance.

Correspondingly, all block chains can only excel two of the following three aspects:
energy efficiency, decentralization and security. The commonly used consensus
algorithms are POW, POS, DPOS and PBFT. Their performances in terms of these three

aspects are shown below:

¢ POW: Proof of Work, generate a new block through massive hash
computations which result in an appropriate random number. This is most secure
mechanism. But it also comes with the highest energy cost.

¢ POS: Proof of Stake, reduces the difficulty for block generation according to
the amount and time of tokens possessed, which also greatly reduces the energy cost of
POW. However, its security is sacrificed and is susceptible to bifurcation.

¢ DPOS: Delegate Proof of Stake. A certain number of delegates are elected by
voting. These delegates will generate blocks in a certain sequence, which greatly
reduced the number of verification nodes that are needed. In this mechanism, deal
verification is greatly accelerated with no sacrifice of security. However, the system
becomes more centralized.

¢ PBFT: Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance. No token is required in this
mechanism, making it suitable for alliance chains.

After weighing all the pros and cons, Fortuna decides to use an improved hybrid
DPOS algorithm for consensus determination, establishing a secure and efficiency
consensus mechanism. Besides increased centralization, DPOS has another obvious
problem: the voting rights are controlled by users with more FOTA, which marginalized

the roles of other users with less FOTA. To overcome this issue, Fortuna introduced an
36
active index, to reflect how active a user is on the platform. This purpose of this active
index is to 1) encourage the active participation of users; 2) balance their financial

contribution and activeness contribution. The active index is calculated as follows.
UL =TL+AL
TL = NOT 4 NPC 4 NPUC 4 MM
AL = NSA — NFA
UL : user activeness ;
TL : trading activeness ;
AL : arbitrage activeness ;
N©°T : number of CoT created , the CoT has to be used for at least one deal ;
N?r¢ : number of deals cleared under PrC contracts ;
NPC - number of deals cleared under PuC contracts ;
N™™ : number of times serving as a market maker ;

N*%4 : number of times that the consensus result agrees with the arbitrage result ;

NFA : number of times that the consensus result differs from the arbitrage result.

The 101 delegates elected according to the DPOSA in each round will reach an
agreement on the block generation sequence (2 / 3 of the nodes need to reach agreement)
before the blocks are generated. Unless more than | /3 of the delegates collaborate to

sabotage the system, no bifurcation will occur.

2.8 FOTA Value Locking Service

As a distributed risk hedging block chain platform, the purpose of Fortuna is to
achieve rational risk management through decentralization. However, as the only
medium used on the Fortuna platform, FOTA is actively traded on the secondary market
as a digital asset. It will cause devastating damage to the risk hedging trades if its value

is unstable. Therefore, Fortuna introduces the FOTA Value Locking Service (FVLS) to
37
make sure risk hedging trades can be completed under the stable FOTA value. We use
the exchange rate between FOTA and RMB as an example to illustrate FVLS. Suppose
user A and B signed a simple risk hedging contract: each of them pays 100 FOTA as
deposit. A will earn 100 FOTA if its expectation is right, it will lose 100 FOTA otherwise.
The trading modes with and without FVLS are as follows.

1. Hedging without FVLS

In this case, upon the maturity of the contract, if A’s judgement is correct, it will
earn 100 FOTA. A receives 200 FOTA (profit and deposit). But because FOTA devalued
50% against RMB, the 200 FOTA still worth the same as the 100 FOTA that was paid
before the deal. Effectively, user A did not profit nor lose.

2. Hedging with FVLS

In this case, the exchange rate between FOTA and RMB will be locked by Fortuna

until the delivery date of the contract. In the above scenario, when A receives the 200

38
FOTA, Fortuna will offer 200 extra FOTA to user A in order to offset the loss due to
change of exchange rate between FOTA and RMB. The FLVS makes sure users can
hedge without being affected by the fluctuation of FOTA value.

When providing FVLS, Fortuna will execute trades at the opposite position in the
secondary market to achieve dynamic risk hedging and control the overall risk in the

platform. A certain amount of fee needs to be paid by the user for this service.

2.9 Compliance Filter

For the purpose of compliance and sustainable development, Fortuna will set up a
compliance filter. Its details are as below:

1. Types of filter rules: the categories of compliance filters includes ID type (filter
based on the ID of a certain contract template), asset type (filter by the type of underlying
assets), deal attribute type (filter by a certain attribute of the deal, for example, the lower
limit of the deposit fraction), entity type (filter by the entities in the deals, i.e. blocking
any deal with a certain entity)

2. Enactment/Invalidation of filter rules: a compliance filter rule needs the
agreement by the whole network to enact. Certain rules may be invalided under certain
circumstances, such as setting up error, reopening.

Upon the enactment of the compliance filter rules:

1) The rules will be added into the blocks. Before a new template is created, the
platform will query these rules. If any rule is matched, the contract template cannot be
created.

2) After each iteration of the compliance filter rules, the platform will scan all
existing contract templates. Any template that are not compliant will be removed.

We think that a comprehensive compliance filter system is the foundation for the
sustainable development of Fortuna. Therefore, as our business grows, we will update
this system in a timely manner, keeping the platform thrive on a healthy, lawful and

compliant track.

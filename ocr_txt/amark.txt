AMARK
Executive Summary

An attention-based marketing ecosystem that employs blockchain & cryptocurrency to maintain privacy

AMARK is a platform that solves three key problems:
* Local marketing inefficiency from the inability to capture customer attention
¢ The need to collect personal data by marketing solutions

* Poor consumer and merchant adoption of cryptocurrency

Efficient Local Marketing

AMARK began development in 2017 with the goal of improving local marketing efficiency through the
application of attention resource economics and consumer preference indexing. Attention resource
economics properly treats attention as a finite resource and when applied to local marketing, allows
businesses to capture verifiable consumer attention by offering direct compensation for it. AMARK uses
marketing response data to understand consumer preferences and accurately measure the value of
individual consumer attention. Consumers are delivered targeted advertising through AMARK and
compensated for their attention to these offers at a rate that corresponds to their expected future
purchases at aligned businesses. AMARK local marketing efficiency improvements are realized through
achieving verifiable attention, improved attention quality, data-based consumer targeting and effective

distribution.

Blockchain - Ending Personal Data Collection

The consumer pushback against intrusive data collection and resulting governmental privacy regulations
created a need for data-based marketing solutions that ensure consumer privacy. In response, AMARK
adopted blockchain and cryptocurrency as tools to eliminate ANY need for the collection of personally
identifiable information. AMARK uses public blockchain data, overlaid with merchant data, to identify

consumer preferences, understand local trends and set a value for consumer attention.

Marketing offers and attention data profiles are linked only to blockchain wallet addresses rather than to
consumers. Cryptocurrency is the ONLY viable way to privately compensate a consumer for their attention as
other digital payment methods expose the identity of the payee. If an individual consumer receiving an attention
payment was identifiable via the payment method, then all response and preference data could be easily tied

back to that individual, thereby compromising the individual’s data privacy.

AMARK has adopted General Attention Currency [ XAC ] to facilitate private attention payments to

consumers. XAC can be used to purchase goods and services at any AMARK participating business.

A Trojan Horse for Crypto Adoption

Cryptocurrency as a payment method for in-store purchases has not gained significant traction. For consumers,
there is little incentive to buy crypto from exchanges and then use it to make in-store purchases when there are
many other payment methods readily available. For merchants, there are too few consumers making payments
with crypto to warrant the additional setup needed to accept it and convert it to fiat. AMARK eliminates these
hurdles to adoption by changing how consumers and merchants interact with marketing. Merchants will join
AMARK to benefit from a superior marketing system that improves profitability. The activation of AMARK allows
merchants to purchase XAC through the attention marketing system and distribute it to consumers via targeted
advertisements. Consumers receive XAC payments in exchange for their attention to these offers, bypassing the
need to secure crypto through an exchange. Once merchants activate the marketing system, XAC is accepted

natively through in-store terminals without additional setup.

In our view, a pivot of the local advertising model to attention resource economics will lead to

widespread adoption of cryptocurrency by both merchants and consumers.

“AMARK rejects the premise that personally identifiable information must be used to effectively target advertising and is challenging that assumption with a marketing platform that enforces privacy by design.”

Why Blockchain?

An innovation that balances business requirements for data-based marketing with consumer requirements for data privacy

There is a massive profit motive behind personal data collection for marketing companies like Google and Facebook. These companies source demographic and personal interest data
from individuals to better target advertising and drive ROI for their customers. The collection of personal information will continue to accelerate in the absence of an effective alternative
Since it has proven to offer advertisers a competitive advantage in the marketplace. A major flaw in this method of marketing is that the marketer’s demand for personal information

remains out of balance with the consumer’s demand for privacy.

Blockchain enables private data-based marketing.

AMARK has created an implementation of attention resource economics uniquely dependent on blockchain and
cryptocurrency to efficiently target advertising while maintaining the privacy of consumers. The platform links consumer
attention value, represented by blockchain wallet addresses, with direct payments to consumers in exchange for their

attention.

Cryptocurrency offers the ONLY viable way to privately compensate a consumer for their attention as other digital
payment methods expose the identity of the payee. If an individual consumer receiving an attention payment was
identifiable via the payment method, then all response and preference data could easily be tied back to that individual,

thereby compromising the individual's data privacy.

When applied to local marketing, the innovations of blockchain and cryptocurrency restores a balance between

efficient data-marketing and consumer privacy.

General Attention Currency [ XAC |

A decentralized point of sale focused cryptocurrency developed by the General Retail Currency Foundation

Token to Coin

XAC will initially be distributed as a token on the Ethereum blockchain. The
Ethereum token will be used by AMARK as a platform currency while the
XAC blockchain protocol development is completed.

XAC Blockchain

The XAC blockchain is designed to function as an effective point of sale
payment solution while allowing for economic rules that result in value
retention through supply scaling.

MIT

XAC General Use

Through AMARK, the XAC currency will achieve wide distribution to consumers and
concentrated merchant acceptance. This adoption will increase the usefulness of
XAC as a general currency. The protocol will be developed with on-chain and off-
chain transaction scaling capabilities to accommodate the additional use of XAC.

Why not use Bitcoin?

AMARK participants benefit as the value of XAC correlates with the growth of AMARK attention ecosystems

XAC has economic rules to allow the value of XAC to be supported by the demand generated from the AMARK ecosystem.

The high concentration of bitcoin
ownership is a risk to the value of BTC
and therefore presents a risk to
the AMARK ecosystem.

XAC Demand

AMARK expects to quickly build

Introduction

Cryptonex platform (hereinafter "Cryptonex") is developed as international acquiring
and it is based on the blockchain technology. Instead of traditional methods, such as venture
investments and share issue, financial model of cryptofinancing ICO — Initial Coin Offering -
is used for capital rising.

We are convinced that the blockchain technology can speed up development of
economic coparticipation, which is currently solving the sphere's problems by attracting a
significant number of previously unclaimed people. The safe system based on blockchain
technology is protected against unauthorized access. Users can convert fiat money to any
cryptocurrencies and tokens, as well as spend cryptocurrency with the help of bank cards
and mobile applications with contactless payments.

Cryptonex is developed as an open source code platform. To account property rights,
cryptocurrency of the same name Cryptonex, ticker CNX is used. Cryptocurrency Cryptonex
will be in free trade on centralized exchanges in October-November 2017, as soon as the
backoffice and the web wallet are launched.

Blockchain. Review

Blockchain is a fundamentally new kind of database technology realization. It is
optimized to solve a certain set of shortcomings of other similar technologies. Traditionally,
databases have been created as centralized repositories for data processing and transactions
conducting. Limited technical capabilities and security issues are the reason of distributed
databases rare functioning. Blockchain is a technology for distributed databases realization,
allowing to carry out transparent and safe transactions between participants of the system.
By itself, blockchain is a database, founded on collating of distributed copies of the same
database and divided into blocks of transactions between two or more parties. Each block
contains transaction details, but the participants remain anonymous.

The blocks are checked and verified by the entire network with the help of encryption
mechanism, which compares unique signatures of the parties and the general information
about a transaction. The transaction is considered confirmed if the result is the same for all
the nodes. Addition to the chain of previous transactions occurs only after the confirmation.
Otherwise,"consensus" will correct the result on the node with the false data. A register of
blockchain is duplicated simultaneously in many places and each copy is updated separately
in accordance with the data on new transactions.

Security

Encryption is used in blockchain to confirm transactions by verifying the signatures of
the parties, participating in a transaction. This guarantees the absence of «false» operations,
which are not agreed by the parties involved. Complex mathematical calculations
("hashing") are performed with each attempt to enter information into the blockchain. They
deal with the details of a current transaction, the data about the participants and the results
of previous operations.
Dependence of a blockchain current state on the previous transactions ensures
impossibility of their replacement by hackers. In case of hash sum mismatch and discrepancy
with the results of all the rest nodes, the changed data is discarded.

Transparency

Blockchain is a distributed database, maintained and synchronized by interaction of
multiple nodes (for example, by several partners, participating in frequent operations with
each other). Transaction is added to the blockchain only if transaction data have been
confirmed by all the parties. This means, that all the participants can access to one and the
same information. It significantly increases the level of openness and transparency in
comparison with the traditional systems. Their work often relies on various "hidden"
databases, located behind firewalls, which are not available outside of a particular
organization.

Efficiency
Support and maintenance of numerous copies of blockchain database is not less

expensive than service of one centralized database. Practice confirms, that the parties,
performing transactions, duplicate databases with one and the same information of an
operation. Often this information differs and leads to costly, time-consuming negotiations
between the organizations. Blockchain cancels the necessity of manually checks, which
allows saving time and funds. In some cases, blockchain is useful for development of
common, "cooperative" resources, which exclude information duplication for the

Market analysis

Currently, the cryptocurrency market is constantly expanding, increasing capitalization
and offering new channels of investments for its participants. In this analysis, we highlight
the key moments of the cryptocurrency industry development to form understanding of
ongoing processes, causes and effective relationships.

Since 2013, the price of Bitcoin has increased 90-100 times up to $1100 per unit. The
industry experts consider the Cyprus banking crisis to be one of the main reasons for the
cryptocurrency value growth, however, after a rapid rise, there was a predictable fall in the
rate. The start of cryptopayments receiving in the local market caused an increase of Chinese
players’ interest. The rising attractiveness of the cryptocurrency as an object of alternative
investments stopped the fall in the rate and led to Bitcoin strengthening.

The Bitcoin price was more expensive in China than in other countries. As a result,
there appeared plenty of speculative schemes and "black" methods of trading. The
government did not like such kind of activity, and by the end of the year the Central Bank of
China had forbidden cryptocurrency operations and recommended the investors not to
invest their funds. Bitcoin instantly reacted by a two-fold collapse in value. It is noteworthy,
that by the end of 2013, 1,000 the market participants had owned half of all the assets. This
also facilitated destabilizing of the situation at the cryptocurrency market.

Such fluctuations attracted mass media attention. As a result, there was an impetus to
thedevelopment, mining popularization and new cryptocurrencies creation.
use the currency in economics; however, the overall level of trust was extremely low.

One of the main reasons was security issue. It is worth remembering the example of
Japanese exchange Mt.Gox, that lost $473 million because of the hacker attack.

In 2015, despite the sharp ups and downs of the previous year, Bitcoin strengthened
to $450, and in 2016 its value reached $900 per unit. It was facilitated by the increase of
payments in Bitcoins around the world, devaluation of the Yuan, and growing demand of the
Chinese investors, who found the way to bypass the currency control of the government. Not
the last influence was rendered by the fact that despite difficulties in interaction efficiency
Chinese exchanges did not collect commission for transactions. This formed a convenient
environment for high-frequency trading and rising of exchange trade turnover on the
cryptocurrency market. However, the Central Bank of China warned the investors again, and
later announced the audit of a number of exchanges for providing financial stability of
processes. The exchanges temporary restricted funds withdrawal, introduced commission
for conversion and suspended the margin trade, resulting in the Bitcoin rate fall from $1,100
to $800.

The Bitcoin capitalization increase and growing interest of the world community led to
new cryptocurrencies creation. The top five places were occupied by such altcoins as
Litecoin, Ripple (XRP), Ethereum and Dash. The number of fraudulent SCAM-projects
increased. Growth of Ethereum became acceptable among the main altkoins. Its price was
growing significantly during 2016 due to development of decentralized applications,
organizing and carrying out the first ICO (Initial Coin Offering). Despite the hacker attack and
the subsequent division into Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum classic (ETC), by the end of the
year the ETH growth had almost been 300%. It is interesting, that ETC showed its viability: its
price has doubled according to the results of the year.

In 2017, one of the key growth factors was the world community expectations related to
the decision of the American regulators and concerned the launch of ETF based on Bitcoin.
The measure was aimed at stimulating some extra investments, but during the long-time
discussions, SEC refused to employ the instrument. However, it was not a hindrance for
getting more funds from the Asian players. Japanese exchanges came out of the "shadow",
became completely legal and got the necessary legal resources to make Bitcoin a legitimate
kind of payment.
After that the cryptocurrency became free from sales tax. Undoubtedly, that situation
caused a real "boom" in the market, and the Japanese Yen as a dominant investment
currency replaced Yuan. At the same time, the demand for cryptocurrency among the
Korean players also increased. It happened due to the mass media, that formed a positive
image and cryptocurrency prospects, and due to Korean exchanges, which were provided
with financial and reputational support from the country’s main conglomerates.

Nevertheless, the market efficiency, which was expressed in a colossal price gap of
Bitcoinsin Asia and in other countries, continued to attract speculators. On separate days,
the cost of Bitcoin in Korean market received a 50% premium, which triggered investments
increase in arbitrage trading. Nowadays, there is an opinion that the Asian players invest
great sums not only because of convenient legal investment climate, but also due to their
desire to be competitive, to be trendmakers of events in the world market, to quickly enrich
by supporting new promising cryptocurrencies. Investments in new currencies, that were
put into circulation by local exchanges, exceeded in amount the investments in similar
European projects. The investments from Korean and Japanese money allowed Ripple to
show a tenfold increase within a month. A similar result was shown by Litecoin in two
months. Bitcoin became a stable reserved option; the risks of
investing in it were significantly decreased in comparison to the previous periods.

The impetus for blockchain technology development was ICO (Initial Coins Offering).
This tool allows new blockchain industry projects to attract capital at the start of the project
by selling tokens (crowdsale). In most cases ICO is based on Ethereum smart contracts; in
order to participate, it is necessary to buy ETH (or BTC). It was another important Ethereum
platform growth factor, in a short period of time it entered the market and became popular
among the leading cryptocurrencies. Now some new promising projects, based on their own
platforms, appear. They are attractive investments channels due to the industry
development and they are offering wider and more convenient functionality for their users.
Icobazaar.com says, that more than $ 900 million has been attracted with the help of ICO
since the beginning of 2017. In accordance with coinmarketcap.com, the capitalization of
the TOP—40 projects, which appeared as a result of the tokens sale in 2016-2017, reached $
4 billion.
The Ethereum growth is also affected by a speculative factor: if the launch of a large
ICO is planned, then, respectively, the demand for ETH is expected and great number of
people, who want to play on the increase.

Interest in the cryptocurrency market is constantly increasing. Arbitrage strategies can
be applied because of inefficiency, caused by a price gap between regions. External factors
are also important, for example, mass media participation. In most countries there is no
exchange control, so trade of insider and manipulative information, use of the techniques,
forbidden on traditional financial exchanges, are not ruled out. The example is the Litecoin
growth before the SegWit activation, which allowed to increase throughout blockchain and
announced the placement of currency on Korean exchanges. Operations on the exchanges
are also realized by new companies, so it is rather difficult to trade, dealing with high
volatility and surges in volume. Quite often, trades are suspended and the assets of the
exchange are frozen. The withdrawal period, even with the normal platform functioning can
take much time, and hacker attacks threaten the very existence of investors' funds.

Particular attention should be paid to the so-called flash-crash, i.e. the situations when
the cryptocurrency price falls sharply because of insufficient liquidity in case of a large
application for withdrawal or conversion of funds. It is worth noting that due to the
increasing automation and use of complex algorithms, traditional financial exchanges are
not protected as well.

A striking example is fall in the Ethereum rate from $317 to $224 and then to $1 (with
a subsequent refund) due to market order of $12.5 million with immediate execution. To
prevent such situations, it is discussed the introduction of circuit breakers (suspension of
trading with a significant price deviation for a short time) and maximum possible market
order with immediate execution. Market speculation is confirmed by the capitalization
indicator in relation to the trade volume per day. While Bitcoin shows acceptable for this
area 1-5%, some currencies (for example, Ethereum) sometimes reach 25%.

In conclusion, it is worthy highlighting, that at present, there is no centralized platform
for converting all the currencies.
Even Bittrex, one of the largest exchange platforms, which offers more than 900 items
for exchange, has limited functionality and does not convert cryptocurrency into different
countries’ currencies. This complicates funds withdrawal for users and demands additional
time and financial costs. Nevertheless, technologies and blockchain are actively developing
with the help of employing more and more intellectual resources of high-quality, including
ICO, that allows to attract investments and develop speed and security of transactions.

Cryptonex (CNX) - Global Blockchain Acquiring

Cryptonex is a global, decentralized cryptocurrency, developed on its own blockchain
platform. The main goal is to provide the opportunity to exchange any currencies of the
world for any cryptocurrencies and tokens, buy goods and services using a mobile phone and
payment cards. Instantly, with minimum commission.

Let's analyze this scheme in details:

Blockchain services <=> contactless payments

1. Conversion

Storage of CNX, BTC and Ether will be available after the web wallet launch in
September. There are plans to add the most popular cryptocurrencies. Employing only one
web wallet, a user gets an access to all the popular cryptocurrencies.

Due to instant conversion in the backoffice, the user will avoid a long-time
expectation, as it happens on many exchanges, and he/she will have the guarantee of
carrying out a transaction. If the balance of at least one kind of cryptocurrency is positive,
the user is able to employ a card or a mobile application. The application will show the price
both in fiat money and cryptocurrency, so the user can choose the wallet to pay from.
Hardware wallet (flash drive) will be released for ensuring the security of large sums of
cryptocurrencies.
2. Exchanges
Cryptonex is scheduled to be listed on the exchanges in October-November 2017.

Currently, we have reached an agreement on connecting to cryptocurrency exchangers with
pairs like eth / btc cnx / btc, cnx / eth, as well as with such pairs as btc / usd, cnx / usd, etc.
In the future, it is planned the addition to exchanges acquiring, which can use all its
functions: deposit, withdrawal of funds, payment for purchases, etc.

3. Cryptocurrencies

We will add to acquiring "long-standing", dynamically developing and the most
popular cryptocurrencies

4. Mining pools

After connecting the third-party mining pools, the user will be able to get a reward into
the webwallet and employ all the features: making purchases in a store, etc.

5. API
Blockchain and other Internet services can be used according to their purposes by
connecting to a high-speed acquiring API.

6. Banks

We plan to found or buy a ready-made bank in Singapore or in another country under
friendly jurisdiction. The documents cost with all the licenses is $ 400 000 — 900 000. The
registration takes 1-4 months (depending on the task — purchase or foundation). This
includes connection to Visa / Mastercard payment systems and issuance of cards at will of
clients. A mobile application with contactless payments and virtual cards will be the most

preferable. There are plans to add thirdparty banks to acquiring.

7. Cards, virtual and real

Due to immediate exchange in the backoffice, a user instantly gets funds on a virtual
or real card and can carry out payments and transactions between accounts.

8. Mobile application

It will include the functions of web wallet and contactless payments. It will be available
for iOS and Android.

9. Protection

Cryptonex uses an encryption Scrypt algorithm. It protects all the transactions and
wallets from external hacking. Due to our technical solution, the important files in the web
wallet cannot be found by Trojans and other malicious programs. The access can be
encrypted, the password is strongly recommended to be kept in a safe place. Moreover, the
mining procedure provides safety, as block closure is verified by all the nodes, and if
information desynchronization takes place, a suspicious transaction is rejected.

Some particular Cryptonex features are implemented in other cryptocurrencies, such as
Dash debit cards and Cryptopay.

8
However, there is no full functionality, aggregating all the financial flows in a
blockchain. Cryptonex team has integrated all the current technologies in the platform and
the backoffice. This allows to carry out main operations in one place. We guarantee speed
and security of transactions.

Thus, Cryptonex:
1. Accumulates traffic from LocalBitcoins, cryptocurrency exchanges and fiat exchangers.
2. Facilitates deposit/withdrawal and exchange procedures.
3. Combines financial flows in blockchain, providing new opportunities for blockchain
community growth.
Mining
Cryptonex provides two types of mining: Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake. Sum of
105 000 000 CNX is reserved for mining.

The profit of P-o-S mining is 12% per annum. For this, you need to get coins and keep
your wallet online all the time. Instructions for P-o-W mining will be published after ICO
completion.

Share with us and get a reward.

ICO

ICO (Initial Coin Offering) is an issuance of coupons, tokens or coins in the form of a
cryptocurrency to pay for services of the platform in the future. We suggest that you
evaluate the technology, Cryptonex prospects and purchase an appropriate number of coins
(CNX) as an investment in the platform development. The received funds will be used for
further enhancement of the project, implementation of the road map and improvement of
new technological solutions, which develop Cryptonex cryptocurrency and the blockchain
community in whole.

Cryptonex price: 1 CNX = 0.0005 BTC | 1 CNX = 0.007 ETH. DASH price is 120 times
more expensive, Ethereum — 150 times.
We expect, that along with the growth of technology and gradual implementation of
the road map, the Cryptonex price will increase.
ICO procedure takes September (1-30).
The amount of coins (CNX) available for purchase within ICO period is 85,000,000 CNX.
If the coins remain unused after ICO completion, they move to "cool wallet". During a

planned cooperation expansion and the launch of acquiring, the coins are sold to banks in
accordance with demand.

introduction of new legal norms into the legislation of the countries, in which the acquiring
will operate, as well as tracks the prerequisites for their occurrence. Transparency of actions
and legal purity are the company’s priorities. During the project development, it is planned
to expand legal support for the CNX legitimate distribution in various countries with an
attractive investment climate. There are plans to recruit a new, high-qualified personnel of
an international level. As soon as ICO procedure completes, we will obtain all the necessary
licenses and documents.

Network Admin Front-end Developer DBA Specialist

Within 6 years the team has developed many interesting and demanded projects.
Here is the list of the most significant of them:

Service application for Forex broker customers

The traders' backoffice, which allows to manage finance, accounts and other
opportunities ofthe trading platform, employing common for all the users system. The
system is developed taking into account the requirements for high load and the possibilities
of horizontal scaling. At the peak of maximum load, the application can provide unimpeded
access to a server for 10,000 clients.

Management system of investment trading

This is one of the best platforms from the point of view of functionality. It is worth to
highlight the distributed scheme of partner deductions, the ability to count profit of the
user's choice, the loss control system, the flexible system of rollover schedule and much
more. The system has the horizontal scaling possibility and theoretically is not limited in
growth.

Monitoring system for trading and investment accounts
The platform for collecting trade statistics, investment and movements of finance

between the client accounts is as good as MyFxBook and its equivalents. The modular
scheme allows easy and timely integrating new analysis methods. It gives a competitive
advantage, when a client chooses an analysis platform, based on a set of functional tools.

13
Being the first criterion of customer loyalty,the system is specifically focused on
functionality.

System of statistics
This includes modules for working with ticker data of the market, functional tools

statistics and strategies, a behaviour planning system and more. Development allows
analyzing customers’ behavior of a trading platform, adjusting and forecasting the required
amount of funds in clearing accounts, allocating risks and choosing the strategy necessary
for the company to work with clients and service providers.

Aggregate system for HFT — trading

HFT — trading is hardly imagined without access to several banks or aggregators. The
advantage of this approach is obvious. Several service modules for integration and
maintenance of protocols of aggregate Currenex systems and Integral have been developed
by the team.

Bonus and competitive system

The system has been developed to reward the customers for a particular activity, such
as deposit for management or the best results of turnover for a certain period. The system
allows introducing new of encouraging and evaluating methods.

Management modules for trading platforms
In the arsenal of the team there are several modules for integration with modern

trading platforms. For rapid implementation our specialists beforehand learn the platforms,
which are gaining popularity. The team also develops plug-ins for trading platforms, which
change the behavior in accordance with the customer requirements. One of these solutions
examples is the possibility to choose the scheme of customer service: full/partial entering
the market, entering to a certain provider of liquidity or service inside the trading platform
without providing foreign trade

System of market behavior modeling

The team has several projects, related to market movement modeling to provide
internalliquidity or conduct tests that determine various strategies of the company
development

System of instant investment and loss control

The team has developed a completely new approach to investing in trading accounts.
An investor can immediately enter or exit the market, redistribute the funds instantaneously
or according the plans. Due to lack of binding to rollovers and share schemes, the customers
have an opportunity of accurate control of losses, irrespective of the manager's declared
expenses; they can clearly determine the risks.

FAQ

1. Is Cryptonex a SCAM project?
Many investors are worried about the issue due to rising popularity of the

cryptocurrency market. There is a great number of projects aiming at collecting money and
finishing the activity. In order to make investors confident in the investments reliability, we
disclose the main participants of the project, develop the platform and launch the web
wallet with the help of our own funds, discuss issues with our audience via social nets. Being
on the start of the project, we are implementing a roadmap and making efforts to be listed
on the exchanges. Cryptonex project is an ambitious and innovative platform, aimed at
developing blockchain technology. In the future, our decisions-making will help Cryptonex
be recognizable among the most popular global cryptocurrencies. It will bring profit to all
the parties involved in the project.

2. Will there be enough technical resources to implement the project?
For carrying out the ambitious tasks which have been set and are being gradually

realized by the Cryptonex team, advanced-qualified personnel is firstly required. Currently,
at the initial stage of the project, the specialists experienced in software development for
financial markets are working. ECN—-broker with access to the interbank market, an
aggregator of providers of liquidity for HFT-trading, systems of portfolio investments,
PAMM-accounts have been developed by our team. However, there are many difficult tasks
ahead, so the funds will partly be spent on attracting the European and Asian specialists to
strengthen the developers’ team and get new ideas and solutions to the project realization.

3. Can legal problems occur?

Nowadays, the cryptocurrency market is practically unregulated by the different
countries governments. Legislatures are finding a solution and developing a legal framework
concerning cryptocurrencies and exchanges. To ensure legal clarity of Cryptonex project
implementation, we have reached an agreement with the Asian partners on purchase of a
bank in Singapore or in another country under friendly jurisdiction for conducting
transactions via the bank. The operations do not violate the existing international and local
legislation of the countries, which residents are the cardholders.

4. Can the currency fail to grow in price?

Every day plenty of new currencies and tokens in ICO do not show growth and later
become “lost” among the variety of similar projects. There are several main reasons of such
start-ups failure: they do not develop blockchain community, they do not attempt to offer
useful tools for the cryptocurrency holders and, in essence, they are the clones of already
existing projects. The key difference of Cryptonex is a technological contribution to the
blockchain development and desire to make cryptocurrency usage safer and more
convenient. For this purpose, we developedthe software, which combines the current tools
in one platform. Cryptonex is trying to raise interest in the cryptocurrency. Due to instant
conversion of cryptocurrency into any currencies of different countries, people have the
opportunity to purchase goods in any shops of the world.

TS
5. When will the listing be? Are you sure that the currency will be listed on the
exchanges?

Listing on the cryptocurrency exchanges is planned for October-November 2017.
To make Cryptonex (CNX) enter the exchanges, it is necessary to satisfy the requirements of
the specific platforms. Before ICO start, the currency meets all the demands for listing launch
and entering the main exchanges. Cryptonex team is in a direct dialogue with the world's
leading exchanges and has already made the preliminary arrangement of the currency
gradual entering after ICO completion.

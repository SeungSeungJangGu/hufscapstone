WHITEPAPER V1.6

1. INTRODUCTION

Records of prediction markets can be traced back as far as 1503, while some ar-

gue that they could be as old as humankind itself. They have stood the test of time,
enriched cultures, and contributed to people’s lives with thrill and joy throughout
history. Lately, these markets have enjoyed increased popularity, with the number of
market participants significantly increasing due to regulatory changes and the ease
of online access. Still, this comes almost as a surprise, considering how little innova-
tion prediction markets have experienced overall. Even though new games have been
developed and the internet has enabled the birth of new entertainment sources, the
binary result of financial gain or loss has persisted ever since. As such, new incre-
mental innovations might have led to new sources of entertainment, but no disruptive
changes have been introduced to capture greater value for the consumers in predic-
tion markets. Traditionally, the chance for financial loss almost always trumped the
chances of financial gain for the consumers, arguably reducing the long-term enter-
tainment factor through the experienced loss. We don’t believe that these dynamics

are the final stage in the evolution of prediction markets.

This is where Nezha positions itself: Introducing the next generation of prediction

markets.

Nezha is the liquidity engine for prediction markets where the participants do not
wager the principal stake but rather the yield generated on the pooled principal of

all participants. Through staking liquidity and yield aggregation, Nezha utilises the
power of DeFi to change the old industry dynamics radically. These improvements
have no adverse effect on the essential characteristic of first-generation prediction
markets that we intend to maintain: the greatest entertainment. The next generation
of prediction markets offers the same joy and incentive of financial gain without the
looming risk of financial loss. Additionally, the next generation incentivises larger
stakes, increased liquidity and positive flywheel effects for the prediction market
distributors. Due to the positive-sum dynamics and positive expected outcomes for
protocol participants, the next generation of prediction markets is a gamified staking
strategy rather than only a source of entertainment. Through yield aggregation and
game characteristics, protocol participants not only enjoy games but become eligible
to win the accumulated YieldPot during each game cycle.
WHITEPAPER V1.6

2. NEZHA DETAILS

Nezha plans to position itself as a leading gamified yield aggregator by offering
positive-sum prediction markets. In doing so, we provide both a novel alternative to
traditional DeFi yield strategies and change inherently zero-sum prediction games for
the better.

Through staking stablecoins in the Nezha Protocol, DeFi stakers can maintain the
benefits of stablecoins, while gaining exposure to the chance of high rewards
through winning the Nezha prediction games instead of receiving continuous yield
as being the benchmark state of other DeFi protocols. As such, the Nezha games
enable chances for large multipliers while minimising downside risks, regardless if
the market is trading sideways, down or up. The protocol offers an exciting new alter-
native to utilising stablecoin reserves instead of simply holding them or staking for
guaranteed but modest APRs. Secondly, Nezha gives prediction market enthusiasts
an attractive option to partake in prediction games while limiting risks through stak-
ing their principal stakes in yield routing contracts instead of wagering the principle
itself. Instead of wagering stakes with the negative expected outcomes, Nezha pools
liquidity and uses yield routing across DeFi protocols to distribute yield to prediction

market participants.

To fulfil this mission, Nezha is developing an ecosystem with a multitude of mech-
anisms to ensure attractive yields, security, and long-term growth and stability. As
the core of the ecosystem, Nezha’s liquidity engine directs liquidity from prediction
market participants into yield protocols. Sustainable liquidity flows are stimulated
through the offering of a new area of prediction market entertainment, achieved
through sophisticated game development, combined with quickly scaling attractive
yield opportunities.

To gain access to the prediction games, users will be required to stake into the NEZ
protocol, where their stake will remain locked until the end of each game’s cycle.
After the lockup period, participants can withdraw their principal stake and any gains
or leave their balance staked to participate in the next game’s cycle. The assets are
pooled and routed to external yield producing protocols. These protocols will gener-
ate daily compounding yield that is distributed weekly into the Nezha pools.
WHITEPAPER V1.6

3. PROTOCOL
MECHANISMS

Each week, the accumulated returns from the yield protocols will be allocated to vari-
ous pools. Each of the pools plays a vital role in the Nezha ecosystem. Details about

each of the pools will be introduced in the following section.

PREDICTION POOL

Each week, the potential yield available for distribution among the winning partic-
ipants is transferred to the prediction pool, which accounts for the majority of the
generated weekly interest. Depending on the outcome of the weekly prediction game,
the YieldPot is available to be claimed by the owners of the participating wallet
addresses. The YieldPot is equal to one hundred per cent of the Prediction Pool in
any given week. Depending on the prediction game mechanisms, winners will be
determined based on the outcomes of each weekly game cycle. In the first iteration,
Nezha will be launching a Prediction Draw Game in which six numbers are attributed
to each entry in the prediction market. Each participant is awarded entries propor-
tional to the number of tokens staked into the protocol. The entries hold the series of
numbers as well as a unique identifying id per entry ticket.

Each series of numbers is generated through a True Randomness Generator using
atmospheric noise to translate it into a sequence of random numbers. A separate
sequence is initiated to generate the winning number of the lottery. Using a VRF
infrastructure, we generate a sequence of 6 unique numbers generated at random
using Goldberg’s verifiable random function. In this function, a public and a se-

cret key are generated. The secret key is generated by selecting a number from the
secp245k1 elliptic curve used by Ethereum’s cryptography. The contract request from
Nezha creates a seed key while the Oracle creates a public key. Firstly using these
two keys to hash the input to the curve, we obtain a cryptographically secure sample
from secp245k1. This is assured through recursive hashing the inputs using kec-
cak256 until the output is less than the order of secp256k1s base field (“p”). This is
the x ordinate of a random point (x,y) on the secp245k1.

The ordinate is then multiplied as a secp256k1 curve point by the secret key to obtain
point Y. The keccak256 hash of Y, as a uint256, is the VRF output. It generates proof
that Y is the same multiple of (x,y) as the oracle’s public key is of the secp256k1
PREDICTION POOL

generator. Then it computes v=nx(x,y). Next, it hashes together (x,y), its VRF public
key, Y, the address of u, and v, takes the remainder of that hash modulo #secp256k1,
and calls that c. Finally, it computes s=n-cxk modulo #secp256k1, where k is its se-
cret VRF key. The proof is its public key, Y, c, s, and its input seed. It sends this back
to the on-chain VRF machinery, which verifies the proof, and sends the output back
to the consuming contract, assuming the proof verifies. This assured true random-

ness as well as transparency for all market participants.

For the first game iteration, payouts from the prediction pool are structured into two
tiers. In the event that any participant holds four or more of the drawn numbers in
the correct order, they hold a claim to part of the Prediction Pool. All participants
who hold four out of six drawn numbers in the correct order are awarded a claim of
the total YieldPot. Market participants who hold five out of six numbers matching
the prediction market outcome in the correct order will be awarded a higher claim of
the total YieldPot. Market participants who hold six out of six numbers matching the
prediction market outcome in the correct order will be awarded the grand prize.

This grand prize is backed through an insurance payout. The grand prize will vary

on a weekly basis and depends on the APY available and the TVL. Furthermore,

to celebrate such an event, participants who hold six out of six will be awarded

exclusively minted NFTs.

These dynamics provide sufficient variety to assure non-bias towards large market
participants as well as continuous increases in value of the yield generating sum.

The likelihood of the first five numbers being drawn is calculated as:

56! _ 56x55x54x53x52x51! = 458.377.920
5!(56-5)! 5x4x3x2x1x51! 120

= 3,819,816

In the first draw, five numbers are randomly drawn out of a sample of fifty-six
where ! indicates = n! = nx(n-1)x(n-2)x...x2x1

In the second tier of the draw one number is drawn from a sample of ten resulting in:

10!

aoa = 10
PREDICTION POOL

As such follows that the chances of a top level draw are equal to:

1 1 1
3819816 * 10 ~  3,819,8160

The chance of a second level prize draw are hence equal to:

1 9 1
3.819.816 * 10 4244240

The third and last tier with guaranteed access to the YieldPot hence

follows the probability of:

255 9 St
3819816 * 410 848848

3. PROTOCOL MECHANISMS

ROLLOVER POOL

All yield that has not been distributed according to market outcomes will be auto-
matically rolled over into the Rollover Pool. The Rollover Pool routes the assets back
into yield generating opportunities. There, they continue to be compounded ona
daily basis, generating further value for the next cycle’s distribution and the Nezha

ecosystem.

OPERATIONAL POOL

A percentage of the yield generated will be awarded into the Operational Fund Pool,
which is crucial to sustaining the ongoing development of the Nezha ecosystem. The
share required to fund operations will vary depending on the stage of development
and market conditions. Therefore, rates might vary for the operational fund pool.
Altogether, the pool will cover operating expenses such as payroll expenses, legal ex-
penses, marketing costs, further technological developments, general and adminis-
trative expenses, or other operating expenses. The Operational Pool will be managed

by the board and association members of the Nezha DAO.

RESERVE POOL

As protecting our community is of greatest priority for Nezha, it is crucial to
implement mechanisms that protect our protocol participants against losses of
their assets. To do so, Nezha is implementing risk hedges against risks such as
smart contract risk as well as market participant defaults. A percentage of the yield
generated each week will be dedicated to our own Reserve Pool. This Reserve Pool
will be built up over time. Initially, this reserve pool will be subsidised by our native
token NEZ but will shift to full stable coin based as liquidity in the protocol allows.
3. PROTOCOL MECHANISMS

AFFILIATE FLYWHEEL POOL

A further part of the generated yield is routed to fund our affiliate flywheel pool.
Assets in the pool will be paid out as rewards for referrals and shared among any
people introducing new members to the Nezha ecosystem at any given time.
Referral payouts will be made automatically as certain triggers are fulfilled. These
include the participation in at least one full cycle of a Nezha game by the referred
party. Payouts in the Affiliate Flywheel Pool will occur on a monthly basis and will
be awarded pro-rata to the overall amount of referrals made. Depending on the
current pool size, the flywheel pool may be subsidised with our native token NEZ to

encourage the organic growth of the Nezha ecosystem at all times.
NEZAH FOUNDATION POOL

Furthermore, ten percent of the generated yield flows into our Nezha foundation
pool. This pool will be created as soon as Nezha has reached operational sustain-
ability. As Nezha is committed to empowering the individual through technological
advancements, the foundation pool marks an important contribution to change the
world for the better. In doing so, the foundation pool is using its capital to promote
equal access to technology and fund access to computer science education, with
the ambition to inspire positive change. Believing in the power of innovating with-
in stagnant markets, it is our ambition to support individuals who seek to improve
other industries and processes to disrupt the status quo. We aim to operate this
initiative at a global scale, harnessing the potential in many of the regions with too
little access to needed funding.
3. PROTOCOL MECHANISMS fe

PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS OF THE
NEZHA LIQUIDITY ENGINE

A second stage of the Nezha ecosystem will be introduced after sufficient scaling of
the current operations. These developments will centre around adding further utili-
ties for our token holders and to the ecosystem. Aside from the already implemented

mechanisms, the following awaits to be added to the Nezha ecosystem:
ADDITIONAL PREDICTION MARKETS

First, a variety of new prediction market games are planned to be offered to the
community. To encompass the organic development and implementation of such,
different actors and mechanisms need to be introduced. With the core utility of
the liquidity engine remaining unchanged, the yield will be distributed among the
different prediction game pools. In doing so, Nezha will be offering a multitude of
different prediction market games, growing an ecosystem of diverse entertainment
options for our community. Next to the development of further internal games,
Nezha will open the ecosystem to community-led development of games.
Moreover, Nezha will make its technology accessible through white-labelling so
other operations may offer non-Nezha branded prediction market games on their
platform leveraging the technologies built by Nezha.

P-10
3. PROTOCOL MECHANISMS

N PREDICTION POOLS

To achieve such, multiple prediction pools for each of the introduced prediction
games are needed. The basic functionality of such pools remains the same:

protocol participants can receive yield from the prediction pools distributed to them
depending on the game’s outcome. For all Prediction Pools relating to internal games
published by Nezha, these will be done automatically, and their mechanics will be
defined by the Nezha DAO consisting of its board and members. For the origination
of Whitelabel prediction pools, the operator will receive the flexibility to change the
distribution mechanics to their liking. Hence, Nezha will continue to manage liquidity
for all Whitelabel solutions; however, the operator will be responsible for the
organisation of governance of the distribution mechanics. For all community lead
new game proposals, the community member will need to stake a certain amount of
NEZ to be able to originate a new Prediction Pool. The mechanics of these pools will
be dictated by the developing community.

ROLLOVER POOLS

Linked to each prediction pool, each prediction game has its respective rollover pool.
The remains of any accrued yield that has remained undistributed will be available to
flow back into yield generating opportunities. The game developer or operator will be
able to govern the dynamics of these pools.

P-11
4. TOKENOMICS oe

To ensure the continuous growth of the ecosystem, our native utility token NEZ

is equipped with a multitude of features. The core utility of the token is staking,
access to tiers, governance rights, pool origination, and the buyback and burn
program. Token holders can benefit from such utility by staking the tokens into the
Nezha ecosystem or by supplying them for liquidity mining at DEX. Nezha is focused
on building infrastructure around yield aggregation and next-generation prediction
markets, and Nezha will continue to add and refine token utility accordingly.

PREMIUM TIERS

Firstly, staking NEZ into its native ecosystem enables access to premium tiers to

its holders. Such tiers correspond to a premium user experience, only achievable
through staking NEZ tokens. Depending on the tier level, premium users are reward-
ed with extra market entries proportional to their stake in the protocol. Furthermore,
staking tokens will give access to premium game pools and early releases. If a user
stays a premium member for a certain time frame, this commitment to the Nezha
community will be rewarded by receiving exclusively minted Nezha NFTs.

GOVERNANCE

Through staking NEZ, holders of the token gain certain governance rights in

the Nezha ecosystem. Token holders will be granted rights that allow participation
in governance and administrative decisions, as well as voting on the operational
development of the ecosystem. Any token holder who has staked their NEZ within
the Nezha platform can contribute a suggested improvement to the ecosystem. All
suggested improvements will be reviewed by the board of the DAO and suggested
solutions will be proposed to all members. Solutions will be implemented if they
achieve a three-quarter majority of votes by all DAO members.

Independent of DAO membership, members will be able to vote on newly submitted
games or game proposals by developers. This allows the developer to test any games
prior to significant expenditures in marketing and developing them. Nezha strongly
encourages all developers to offer special access rights and other benefits to

members who have voted on their proposal.

P-12
4. TOKENOMICS

During the second stage of the Nezha ecosystem, staking tokens into the Nezha
protocols will enable independent developers to design new prediction market
games. Independent developers building on the Nezha protocol will be required to
stake NEZ to submit projects, which will be audited, and then voted on by other
protocol participants. Besides contributing to the well-being of the protocol through
long-term participation, such staking will ensure the growth of our ecosystem,
leading to a quickly growing source of entertainment fueled by the inputs of our

beloved community.
POOL ORIGINATION

In order to launch the pools required to operate a game, participants will be required
to stake a certain amount of NEZ tokens. The exact amount of tokens will be defined
at a later stage and will be voted upon by all members of the DAO. Pool origina-

tion requests will be voted on by all members of the DAO to ensure that the games
launched reflect the best interests of the community.

LIQUIDITY MINING

Nezha will proactively list the NEZ token on several external exchanges which
require liquidity to be locked to operate the exchange pool. Liquidity providers will be
awarded a percentage of the fees generated in these pools. The distribution of those
is not controlled by Nezha but by the operator of the exchange. Nezha will separately
reward Liquidity Providers with NEZ as well as stable coin rewards. The mechanics of
this are outlined in the section on Liquidity Provider Pools in this paper.

BUYBACK AND BURN POOL

To ensure price stability and value creation for NEZ token holders, a buy-back and
burn protocol aims to protect the native token NEZ from price depreciation.
Specifically, a small portion of each week’s generated yield funds our buy-back and
burn pool, counteracting bearish market periods. The Board of the Nezha DAO will
propose a buyback and burn initiation on which all members can vote. If the vote is
successfully approved as defined by a two-thirds majority, Nezha will manually place
buy orders and burn corresponding tokens. This promotes less volatility in token
price even during bearish markets, and long-term appreciation of the token’s value
through reducing the amount of circulating tokens following the rules of supply and

demand economics.

TOKEN DISTRIBUTION

Our native NEZ token is at the heart of the Nezha ecosystem and fuels our ability to
grow and develop new games. Less than seventeen per cent of all available tokens
are controlled by the community of stakers that finance the initial development of
the platform. About forty-seven percent of the tokens are in control of the operating
team and will be used to fund the development of the ecosystem, provide liquidity on
exchanges, and incentivise the team working for Nezha. About thirty-six percent of
the total tokens are in the control of the community. To safeguard the stability and
health of our ecosystem, we have implemented an eighteen-month vesting period for
all stakers as well as a four year vesting period for members of the operating team.
Our token distribution has been designed with the integrity and stability of our eco-

system in mind.

5. LAUNCH PLANS efe

After careful consideration, we have decided to develop our protocol for multichain
deployment. We will first launch our application on Solana and then deploy to more
ecosystems at the earliest date possible. Furthermore, we continuously evaluate nov-
el developments and opportunities for further deployment, focusing on other third
generation blockchains. While some competition persists between Layer 1 chains,
we recognise the unique benefits of each. We like to remind that each of these Layer
1 chains has invaluable use-cases, and that their sophisticated developments bring
our world one step closer towards decentralisation, inclusiveness, and security.

We see a close fit with Nezha’s values, by aiming to change the world for the better

through the power of technology and decentralisation.

Legacy infrastructure has made prediction markets zero-sum driven environments.
Blockchain technology allows Nezha to fundamentally reinvent prediction markets,
making them a positive-sum game, thereby generating value for all. Furthermore, the
innovation in the DeFi sector, and liquidity in third generation blockchains enables
novel staking strategies through yield aggregation, which Nezha will bring together

through gamification and prediction market activities.

Firstly, we are launching our application on Solana. The growth and development
has been unmatched in recent periods due to the fast scalability enabled through its
novel proof of history consensus protocol. Through streaming transactions, Solana
manages to keep transaction costs low while maintaining high security, benefiting
its Layer-2 dApps tremendously. Here, we look forward to launching our first pool,
enabling us to provide our offering to the community with accessible transaction
costs in due time. The DeFi and GameFi realm has experienced tremendous growth,
with an abundance of liquidity and a engaged community awaiting the Nezha

application.

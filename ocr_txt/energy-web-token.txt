EW-DOS: The Energy Web Decentralized Operating System
Preface

Energy Blockchain and EWF

Since our founding in early 2017, Energy Web Foundation (EWF) has delivered on its initial vision. The

energy sector's first public blockchain—the

(EW Chain)—is live. EWF has also released a

series of open-source software development toolkits (SDKs) enabling market participants to more-easily
launch new digital solutions that support the global transition toward low-carbon energy systems.

This was accomplished with EWF’s 100+ member
organizations, the
, representing 280 million customers.

The energy blockchain space is maturing quickly.
From Thailand, to Austria, to California, to Latin
America, major energy market participants have
already launched or are in the process of launching
first-of-their-kind, enterprise-grade energy blockchain
products on the EW Chain.

Meanwhile, the EW Chain itself is one of the only
public blockchains among any industry worldwide

EW-DOS: The Energy Web Decentralized Operating System

whose validator nodes are run by known corporations,
many of them some of the largest and most-respected
energy companies globally. To date, we count more
than

across 15 countries spanning 17 time zones.

We are proud of the technology groundwork we have
laid, the ecosystem of market participants we have
fostered, and the initial solutions being deployed that
leverage the EW Chain and our SDKs. But our mission
to accelerate the global transition to a low-carbon
future using decentralized and digital technologies
is far from complete.
Over the past three years we’ve worked with our
member organizations to research and test more
than 100 use cases for blockchain in the energy
sector, developed dozens of proof-of-concepts, and
supported the launch of commercial applications.
Along the way, we have learned the following:

Blockchain technology is uniquely capable for
establishing multi-party consensus, anchoring
trust, and providing proofs. It should be used
accordingly, and not primarily as a datastore or
messaging platform.

Open-source software and decentralized system
architectures are critical to unlocking value

in the energy sector with digital technology.
Open-source and open architectures minimize
transaction costs, avoid vendor lock-in, and
support standardization and interoperability.

Simply “adding blockchain” when attempting to
solve a problem does little. Taking advantage of
blockchain’s full potential requires reimagining
business and market processes—including

the roles and responsibilities of different
actors—while embracing new decentralized
architectures.

EW-DOS: The Energy Web Decentralized Operating System

Blockchain is not a replacement for legacy
information technology (IT) systems in the energy
sector. Blockchain should integrate with and
augment legacy IT.

The Energy Web Chain is capable of supporting
enterprise-grade applications with respect

to scale, cost, and data privacy—as long as
solutions are designed with the right architecture,
leveraging the blockchain for its strengths.

With these lessons in mind, we have narrowed our
focus to support what we believe to be the two most-
valuable use cases of blockchain technology in the
energy sector: enhancing energy sector traceability
and unlocking grid flexibility from customer-owned
resources.

Our plan is to now work with some of the world’s
largest energy companies to develop and deploy a
new technology stack focused explicitly on these use
cases. We call this enhanced tech stack the Energy
Web Decentralized Operating System (EW-DOS).

Our vision is for EW-DOS to become a de facto industry
standard: a secure, open-source, shared operating
system for the 21* century grid. It is a stack of software
and standards, including the Energy Web Chain, that
will enable market participants to digitally orchestrate
low-carbon electric systems.
The Challenge

Customers are on track to invest more in
the grid than utilities by 2030. But today’s
power grids and electricity markets are not
designed for a customer-centric future.

Utility-scale wind and solar are now the in most regions of the globe.
Renewable generation will comprise an estimated of overall capacity in the coming decades,
largely replacing thermal generation assets. This alone represents the most dramatic shift in the
electricity sector since the advent of alternating current.

But perhaps more significantly, for the first time renewables and distributed energy resources (DERs,

in over a century individuals, companies, and including distributed solar PV, energy storage,
communities can switch to local, independently- electric mobility, combined heat and power, energy
produced power at prices competitive with management systems, and “smart” appliances such as
grid supply by investing in a mix of large-scale thermostats) .+

EWF ar F Ble g Energ

Customers are making the switch quickly: in the next
ten years, electricity end-users will spend a cumulative
$830B on DERs and $7T on electric mobility. By 2030,
roughly a third of global installed capacity will reside
“behind the meter” (see Figure 1). Along with this
massive investment shift is a coming tsunami of device
interconnections: an estimated 3.5 billion internet-
connected DERs are expected to integrate with
existing electric grids by 2030.

Taken together, these assets have the potential to form
the basis of decarbonized, flexible, resilient energy
systems the world-over. But there’s a fundamental
problem: everything about today’s electricity
markets—from rules governing asset qualification,

to the way prices are set, to the systems used to
monitor and manage the grid—assumes that supply is
controllable, demand is fixed, and grid investment is a
centralized function driven by grid operators.

These assumptions are no longer valid. Supply

from renewables is variable, demand is becoming
flexible, and customer investment in energy is
projected to eclipse grid operator investment over the
next decade—investment taking place in a naturally
decentralized way: some customers want backup
power, others want to lower their energy bill or carbon
footprint, and others simply want to control smart
appliances remotely.

In this environment, asset and customer information
is fragmented across multiple siloed systems and

is often invisible to grid operators.” Consequently,
many assets remain largely isolated from core system
planning and operation functions, and DERs in
particular are chronically underutilized and frequently
fail to capture their full potential value.

We aim to overcome these issues with EW-DOS.

The Opportunity

Use decentralized technologies to enhance
energy-sector traceability and unlock grid
flexibility from customer-owned resources.

Bigger databases, more-efficient algorithms, or faster computers alone will not overcome the challenges
facing grid operators. The problem is today’s grid architecture.

Centralized architectures like the ones used to operate
the grid today ultimately place the burden ona single
party to maintain infrastructure, administer user roles
and permissions, update data based on events over
time, and establish a secure way of coordinating data
across multiple discrete technical and organizational
boundaries on a permissioned basis. In such
architectures, data is duplicated across systems, which
increases the risk of inconsistencies. This in turn leads
to low trust and high cost.

Instead, we believe market participants ranging from

regulators to grid operators to customers need to
fundamentally re-evaluate their respective roles and

EW-DOS: The Energy Web Decentralized Operating System

responsibilities. We believe in democratizing the way
renewables and DERs are integrated into grids, such
that:

Regulators set high-level rules of engagement;

Grid operators provide platforms for transactions
as well as visibility into outcomes;

Individual customers, retailers, DER installers,
and other actors perform many administrative
functions that currently reside within grid
operators.
Our vision is to develop and deploy EW-DOS, a

stack of open-source decentralized technologies
and standards to meet global requirements for
establishing identity, enforcing rules, and facilitating
transactions between billions of assets, customers,
utilities, service providers, and grid operators.

With EW-DOS, we can support
widespread value creation via the two
most-promising use cases we have
uncovered to date:

1. Enhancing traceability in the energy
sector, giving market participants the ability
purchase a variety of digitalized, attribute-

based green commodities ranging from
International Renewable Energy Certificates
(I-RECs) to certified green electric vehicle
charges or low-carbon fuels (e.g., biogas).

Unlocking deep demand-side flexibility,
enabling grid operators to tap into the vast
technical potential of customer-owned
distributed energy resources in a trustwo
low-cost, scalable way.

EW-DOS works by completely inverting today’s
system of top-down, unilateral management of
energy-sector data acquisition and management.

Instead of any given person or device maintaining
separate digital accounts for every product and

service they use (i.e., duplicated identities among
market participants) there’s one universal and
persistent identity controlled by the identity owner
and accessible to all other market participants. When
conditions change (e.g., a customer switching from
one electricity retailer to another), there is no need to
start the registration process from scratch. The identity
owner simply updates its verifiable credentials, directs
new relevant actors to its modified identity, and uses
their identity to sign messages, perform transactions,
and interact with market platforms.

Travel passports are the best analogy for describing
how EW-DOS works. At a very high level, passports

© EW-DOS: The Energy Web Decentralized Operating System

summarize who you are, where you’ve been, and
where you’re allowed to go or not go now and in the
future based on a variety of factors. Passports are a
global standard for verifying identity and credentials;
individuals are granted specific permissions based on
attributes like nationality and the rules of different
jurisdictions; the passport itself contains both intrinsic
data about you as well as dynamic data like visas and
travel history, which evolve and update over time.

EW-DOS is a tool for similarly establishing digital
“passports” for every customer, asset, service
provider, and authority in a given electricity
system. But instead of a central entity being in charge
of verifying credentials and issuing the passport itself,
any individual can create a passport and establish
verified credentials over time through interactions
with peers or various authorities.

Here’s how digital identities fit into the EW-DOS
architecture, step by step (see Figures 2 and 3):

© Digitalize: Any customer, market participant,
or device that wants to participate in a given
electricity market first establishes a self-sovereign
digital identity to coordinate with other systems
and participants. Every digital identity is anchored
on the EW Chain and fully owned and controlled
by its creator forever.

© Authenticate: Once identities are created, local

grid operators and market participants need

a system to authenticate them and know, for
example, whether a given solar PV system in
Asia or an electric vehicle in California is what

it says it is and has the attributes it claims to
have (e.g., power capacity, ownership). To do so,
identity owners make claims to peers or relevant
authorities such as grid operators and installers.

Every claim is authenticated (or not) through
bilateral transactions, in which the “claimer”

(i.e., identity owner) provides a “verifier” (e.g., a
DER installer) with agreed-upon documentation
or data to prove a given credential. For a simple
example, picture a DER owner claiming to a DER
installer that they own a5 kW capacity battery

or solar PV system. As claims are verified, the
underlying digital identity becomes richer and
more trusted. Identity owners can also use claims
to delegate other entities to perform transactions
or claims on their behalf. Claim messaging and
data storage can be done “off-chain” or “on-chain”
depending on the application. The Energy Web
Chain is primarily used for providing proofs about
each identity, enabling market actors to achieve
consensus about a given identity or claim without
needing to share or expose underlying data.

Authorize: Once authenticated, identities must
then be authorized to participate in electricity
markets or services for which they are qualified. To
do so, grid operators, regulators, and/or retailers
create registries that query the pool of on-chain
digital identities and integrate all identities that
meet defined eligibility criteria for any given
market, product, or service. These registries
enforce market rules or business logic based

on the verified claims of digital identities, thus
providing the foundational identity and relational
data that other business processes and systems
rely on—from market bidding, to dispatch, to
settlement.

Operate: With identities allowed into their
respective registries, the corresponding customers
and resources can participate in markets. For a

traceability example, authorized wind plants may
be added to an International Renewable Energy
Certificate registry and begin producing digitally-
unique I-RECs that authorized corporate buyers
can purchase directly. For a flexibility example,
authorized behind-the-meter batteries are added
to a local transmission system operator registry
and begin participating in the wholesale market
for frequency regulation. Actual market operations
are accomplished using a mix of decentralized
architectures and existing information and
operational technology systems, depending on
the requirements of the specific application. Over
time, operational and contractual data can be fed
back to digital identities as verifiable claims to
further augment the performance or “reputation”
rating of each identity.

In this architecture, blockchain-based digital
identities become the common reference point for all
participants and systems within a given market. Just
as real-world passports form the basis for establishing
identity and permissions (e.g., the ability to travel or
work) in any region, they are the basis for registering
and monitoring the actions of assets and customers in
electricity markets.

Decentralized identifiers—enriched by multi-party attestation of
verifiable claims—form the backbone of EW-DOS digital identities.

In this section we describe at a high-level each
component of EW-DOS.

EW Core

EW Chain: A public, Proof-of-Authority blockchain
operated by over 25 companies from 14 countries
spanning 17 time zones. The EW Chain hosts
decentralized identifiers, executes smart
contracts, and provides proofs for verifying the
state of data and events. It features a native token
(EWT) and a suite of templates for creating all
types of traceable digital assets.

Chain Abstraction: Application programming
interfaces (APIs) that provide a standard
communication interface between on-chain
components (e.g., decentralized identifiers and
smart contracts) and off-chain systems and data.
Analogous to middleware in a conventional
operating system.

Messaging: It’s best practice to send messages
(i.e. perform transactions) on blockchain only
when the underlying data requires multi-party
consensus. Most messaging between identities,
contracts, and applications should be done
off-chain using established standards (e.g.,
AMQP, MQTT, STOMP, COAP). EWF’s messaging
solution leverages these standards to establish
a decentralized messaging option facilitating
high-volume/low-latency messaging that can
also be integrated with on-chain transactions and
signatures.

Identity Directory: The Identity Directory
organizes decentralized identifiers (DIDs), which
are self-sovereign digital identities that can

be created and stored independently from a
central authority. Think of a DID as a universal
and interoperable online account that the

user controls and can be used to log in to any
platform or service. The identity holder (the
“subject”) can add as much information as they
like to their identity (i.e., claims) and they can get
this information verified by authorities (e.g., a
government, energy company, bank). Collectively,
this process authenticates an identity. These
verified claims can then be used to selectively
disclose information to third parties, akin to a
person proving that they have a valid driver’s

© EW-DOS: The Energy Web Decentralized Operating System

license by showing the expiry date and the picture
but without disclosing their home address, name,
or age. The core Identity Directory is a smart
contract that contains the universal list of DIDs
and associated claims on the EW Chain. This
architecture gives end users greater agency over
how their digital identity (and associated data)

is used and stored while also offering seamless
interoperability with all decentralized applications
running on the EW Chain.

@ Storage: Given the volume of data in the energy
sector, as well as the complicated regulations
governing its use, it will be impractical to store
data on blockchain at any reasonable scale.

EWF is experimenting with various emerging
decentralized storage solutions, but we expect
that in most cases existing storage solutions (e.g.,
either private cloud or on-premise database) will
be used for commercial applications and the chain
abstraction layer will serve as a connective layer to
on-chain components.

EW Auxiliary Services

@ Legacy and loT Link: EW-DOS does not replace
existing IT systems but rather augments them
by providing a mechanism for more-easily
establishing identity and attributes for customers
and energy-sector assets. EWF is developing
multiple reference architectures for securely
connecting legacy IT systems (e.g., CRM, ERP,
billing engines) as well as loT devices to on-chain
components. Toolkits range from server-side
integrations into big SCADA systems to small,
lightweight implementations that can run ona
small loT device. Link toolkits make use of the
messaging layer to communicate with other
applications.

@ Oracles: In many use cases, on-chain smart
contracts and events require data inputs from
off-chain events or systems. For use cases where
it’s beneficial to leverage multiple input sources
(e.g., monitoring of local voltage for multi-party
reconciliation, reporting of distributed solar for
renewable portfolio standards accounting), EWF is
building on top of emerging open-source protocols
for establishing a network of independent nodes
to provide event data to on-chain contracts.
e@ Bridges: As blockchain technology continues to

mature, we expect multiple blockchain platforms
and protocols to emerge for specific use cases
and/or geographies. To enable identities and
contracts running on the EW Chain to interact with
peers on other blockchain networks, purpose-built
smart contracts called bridges are used. Initial
bridges are designed to transfer tokens between
different blockchains, but over time functionality
will expand to enable any arbitrary data or
transaction to occur between networks.

EW Toolkits

@ Application Registry Reference Architecture:

EWF’s application registry reference architecture
provides market participants a standardized way
to create bespoke registries with administrative
features specific to a particular geography,
market, or application. Application registries act
as an “authorization” layer, setting the rules and
roles for DIDs that wish to participate in the given
market. For example, a national grid operator
may create an application registry that dictates
eligibility for participation in a wholesale market
(e.g., DID must have verified claim as being a
qualified DER and that claim must be signed by
another DID that has a verified claim from the
national regulator).

Every decentralized application (dApp) running
on the EW Chain will have at least one application
registry, but a given application registry can be
applied to multiple applications (in the example
above, a distribution utility could coordinate

with the national grid operator and use the same
registry for a local congestion management
program). EWF’s reference architecture includes a
series of open-source smart contracts and dApps
for managing changes and updates to the registry
and creating an audit trail of all interactions
between DIDs within the registry.

© EW-DOS: The Energy Web Decentralized Operating System

e@ EW Origin: A series of customizable open-
source software modules designed to support
provenance and traceability use cases, including
digital renewable energy marketplaces. Origin
includes three core components: certificate
issuance, tracking, and reporting systems, as well
as extensions for electric mobility and battery
storage tracking.

e@ EWFlexhub: A series of customizable open-
source software modules designed to support
grid balancing and demand flexibility use
cases in a variety of regulatory environments.
Examples include enabling vertically integrated
utilities to launch device-agnostic “bring-your-
own-device” demand response platforms to
helping DERs participate in a variety of wholesale
electricity markets. This toolkit was borne out of
requirements to enable DER participation in a two-
second balancing / frequency response market.

@ Other Toolkits: We are continuing to develop
additional toolkits for renewable energy, DERs,
and electric vehicle market participation as we
gather additional requirements from our global
network of members. In-development toolkits
include functionality that enable digital identities
to settle payment; automatically conduct
evaluation, measurement, and verification (EM&V);
post value in escrow; and engage in complex
transactions (e.g., financial contracts).

The Roadmap

EWF’s Plan to Drive Impact at Scale

EWF's theory-of-change is simple. To achieve our mission we work directly with some of the world’s largest
energy companies—including utilities, grid operators, and others—to develop and deploy solutions based

on EW-DOS.

We believe we can transform the energy sector,
enabling new low-carbon market designs of all
shapes and sizes (in both developed and emerging
economies) by implementing EW-DOS in collaboration
with major market participants. EWF has already
begun to develop and deploy discrete pieces of EW-
DOS with several market participants, including:

In Europe, EWF is helping a transmission system
operator integrate grid-edge customers to participate
in national balancing markets. A “prosumer”
engagement platform enables the country’s
prosumers and hardware vendors to establish DIDs for
themselves and DER devices. The DIDs then are used
to establish claims about DER attributes, location,

and capabilities to inform which market(s) the DER

EW-DOS: The Energy Web Decentralized Operating System

can participate in. For ongoing market participation,
bids—whether submitted individually or as part of an
aggregated pool—are linked to DIDs to prevent double
counting in multiple markets or pools. Following
activation events, DIDs serve as an anchor to reconcile
operational and financial data, and ultimately execute
financial settlement.

In Thailand, EWF is co-developing a renewables
marketplace platform with PTT to simplify corporate
renewable energy procurement across Southeast
Asia. This digital marketplace platform uses DIDs and
a shared registry to streamline the onboarding of
existing and new renewable generation assets, helping
buyers find options that meet their needs, indicate
their demand for new renewable energy projects,
improve transparency into energy use across their
supply chain, and prove their purchases for reporting
purposes. The marketplace also synchronizes with a
solution developed for the issuing bodies of energy
attribute certificates (EACs) to certify transactions
using the DID standard and uses tokens to trace EACs
through their entire lifecycle from generation to
retirement. PTT’s platform will also make it easier to
link electric vehicle (EV) charging with I-REC purchases
to position EVs as a new, large renewable energy buyer
category.

These are only two examples, but they highlight three
important points:

EW-DOS makes it possible to build private
and/or proprietary solutions on top of open-
source software and a public, decentralized
network. If a utility wants a completely walled-off
network where they are the only party capable

of confirming and rejecting DID claims (meaning
they can restrict who does / does not participate
in the local market), EW-DOS supports that. If that
same utility wants all operational matters to be

conducted in-house using legacy IT systems, no
problem. EW-DOS does not prescribe a particular
approach to privacy and is flexible enough to work
in any context.

EW-DOS is market and regulation agnostic.

It creates value in vertically-integrated utility
territories as much as fully deregulated
competitive markets. It works just as well in
established markets in Western Europe as it does
in emerging economies.

EW-DOS is not a “use case” or an “application”;
it is public infrastructure that supports
companies that want to build solutions.

Like other infrastructure platforms such

as telecommunications, the Internet, and
blockchains like the EW Chain, the applicability
of EW-DOS is limited only by the imagination.

It enables myriad use cases and applications,
especially those that leverage the swell of
customer DER investment to envision a low-
carbon, decentralized electricity grid.

EW-DOS in Context

New energy market designs are coming fast. Along with them, so are shifts in roles and responsibilities

across grid operators,’ retailers, and customers.

There are growing trends toward dynamic retail tariffs,
local electricity markets, exposing retail customers to
wholesale markets, and even “peer-to-peer” or other
types of transactive energy markets that clear from the
bottom up. With this context, there is a clear and urgent
need to transition customers—and their assets—from
being a passive “end point” in a complex supply chain
to becoming active participants in a dynamic energy
system.

Novel market designs and regulations are a necessary
step towards achieving the energy transition. For
example, in some jurisdictions, retail customers are
prohibited from providing services to wholesale
markets. But passing policy is only the first step, and
implementation is much more easily said than done.

Even in instances where DER market participation

is allowed (e.g., aggregation in competitive western
Europe, California’s DRAM program), established
processes that grid operators use to integrate large-
scale resources simply don’t scale to customer-owned
DERs. Other factors add further complexity, such as
the arcane rules and systems that govern customer,
DER, and grid data. Maintaining an accurate state of
both the physical and financial relationships between
customers, DERs, and other market participants (e.g.,
aggregators, service providers, and installers) is costly.

As a result, there is a high barrier to entry for
integrating DERs to the grid and operating them to
achieve a net benefit for all system participants.

In terms of scale, impact, and intricacy, this challenge
of integrating DERs into electricity markets is
analogous to another industry currently undergoing
widespread transformation: financial services.
Globally, an estimated are currently
“unbanked” and lack access to traditional financial
products ranging from checking accounts to lines

of credit. Myriad reasons account for why so many
people remain unbanked, yet three prominent barriers
come to the forefront: 1) cost of those services, 2)
lack of access to financial institutions, and 3) lack

of proper documentation and identity verification.

In short, existing systems for performing “know-
your-customer” (KYC) checks and basic account
management are either too complex or costly for
billions of people living in rural and/or developing
economies.

Similarly, in both developed and emerging
electricity markets, most DERs are a) too small
individually for large grid operators to care about,
b) not worth the expense to justify traditional
processes for enrolling, and/or c) simply invisible to
local grid operators. Yet there will soon be far too
many of them (DERs) to ignore or exclude—in both
number and capacity.

It’s wildly impractical for a grid operator to physically
commission every single smart thermostat in their
territory, or to run dedicated fiber optic lines to
every distributed solar PV or energy storage system.

DERs such as solar PV with smart in ters, batt torage systems, and f

DER participation in wholesale markets

In Africa

assurances for kilowatt-scale assets vastly outweighs
the value of each asset’s transactions.

For these reasons, to date the primary way—often the
only way—for DERs to participate in markets is via
aggregators who pool DERs into groups big enough to
matter for traditional electricity markets. Aggregation
is an undeniably useful tool, providing benefits both
to end customers as well as grid operators. But it does
not solve the fundamental problems of onboarding
and integrating DERs at scale and at low cost.
Aggregation only outsources costly administrative
duties to aggregators themselves. These operating
expenses are why even aggregators typically exclude
certain types or sizes of DERs due to the impact on
company profit margins.

Thus, the global energy industry faces two
fundamental barriers to widespread DER integration.
First, there’s the issue of system-wide resource
optimization for tomorrow’s electricity grids in a
renewables- and DER-rich energy future. Second,
there’s the fundamental issue of onboarding, vetting,
and sharing key information about DER attributes,
capabilities, relationships, and behaviors that allows
system-wide optimization in the first place.

With respect to system-wide resource optimization,
tools like Advanced Distribution Management Systems
(ADMs), Distributed Energy Resource Management
Systems (DERMS), and microgrid controllers are
already proven and continue to make progress.

Onboarding and integration remains the thornier
problem:

e@ Verifying Identity and Credentials: Just as banks
need to perform “know-your-customer” checks to
verify the identity of potential customers, assess
their suitability for various products, and manage
risk, grid operators need to qualify and register
every asset that provides services to the electricity
grid. They in essence need to “know-your-device”
(KYD).

e Enforcing Market Rules / Allowing Market
Access: DERs, like any asset, must only be allowed
to participate in markets or provide services for
which they are legally, technically, and financially
capable. Such qualifications may change over
time due to varying physical performance and/or
evolving contractual relationships. In the banking
world there’s an established (albeit imperfect) way
of tracking “reputation” and enabling any relevant
provider to allow or reject participation ina
particular financial service: the credit score. In the
electricity world, there’s no analogous reputation
rating for small assets.

e Exchanging Information (and Value): At
any given time a grid operator and/or other
parties (e.g., aggregators, retailers, customers
themselves) may rely on a single DER to
provide a variety of services. To make optimal
operational (i.e., real-time) and investment
(i.e., planning) decisions, those entities need
to have a common and accurate view of the
attributes, capabilities, and state of each DER,
its physical surroundings, and its contractual
relationships. Therefore the identity, relational,
and operational data associated with each DER
needs to be authenticated and shared efficiently
with all market participants that need access
(e.g., regulators, TSOs, DSOs, aggregators, OEMs,
customers).

These are the challenges EW-DOS is purpose-built to
solve.

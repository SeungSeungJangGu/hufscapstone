Introduction

GBX Limited, a subsidiary of GSX Limited - the Gibraltar Stock Exchange (“GSxX’), is launching an initial
token sale (“Token Sale”) for the Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange (“GBX”) utility token, the Rock Token
(“RKT’).

GBX — the first of its kind

The GBX aims to be the world’s first licensed and regulated token sale platform and digital asset
exchange, operated by a European Union (“EU”) regulated stock exchange.

Using a sponsor and rules-based system, the GBX will apply to be licensed by the Gibraltar Financial
Services Commission (“GFSC”) under the Financial Services (Distributed Ledger Technology Providers)
Regulations 2017 (“DLT Regulations”), which came into operation on 1 January 2018 in Gibraltar.

More specifically, GBX is expected to be:

(a) a global listing and token sales springboard for utility tokens that have satisfied a
strict due diligence process and admission process set out in the “GBX Rules”; and

(b) a high-quality digital asset exchange, including a marketplace where issuers of utility
tokens, traders and investors can participate with confidence and trust in a platform where the
tokens listed have been subjected to an institutional grade approval process.

Commitment to digital assets

The GSxX intends to develop a fully tokenised stock exchange system that will aim to provide a pathway
from listing and trading initial token sales through to accessing funding via the traditional bond market or
equity issuance route. This should give issuers an opportunity to issue tokenised securities to a wider
capital base.

Why Rock Token matters

Rock Token is the proposed “currency of choice” for GBX and its supporting financial services and
fintech ecosystem.

In designing the utility aspects of the Rock Token, GBX considered several questions:

° What is the core brand and value proposition of the GBX platform itself?
° Who are the intended users of the platform, and how are they likely to perceive RKT’s value?
° How can the token be used to incentivise ideal behaviour, discourage misbehaviour, and

improve the overall user experience?

. What is the roadmap of the project, and how can Rock Token support that?

This whitepaper explains how the Rock Token serves the GBX platform in three primary ways:

e Create an engaged community, reflecting the shared buy-in in the overall vision.
e Deliver premium opportunities for users committed to a safe, forward-thinking industry.
e Incentivise community members to uphold GBX values.

Rock Token helps the GBX brand to be anchored in trust and integrity. See Part G for further details.

About this document

This whitepaper details the GBX strategy, our vision for the broader ecosystem, key aspects of the
issuance of the RKT and how RKT is expected to be applied throughout GBX.

The “Key Facts Schedule” also provides a summary of the key information about GBX Limited, GBX, RKT
and the Token Sale. Any sale of Rock Tokens is subject to separate terms and is not available in all
jurisdictions and to all purchasers.

All projects carry variables and contingencies. For the avoidance of doubt, the licensing of GBX and certain other
initiatives as proposed in this whitepaper are subject to regulatory approval.

You must read all relevant documents and obtain the advice you need before making
any decision to purchase Rock Tokens. RKT is not for everyone.

Part A — Industry and Project Overview

1 Industry overview
World Economic Forum — June 2017:

“Like the first generation of the internet, this second generation promises to disrupt business
models and transform industries. Blockchain (also called distributed ledger), the technology
enabling cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, is pulling us into a new era of openness,
decentralization and global inclusion. a

We are fortunate to live in a disruptive time. Since the invention of Bitcoin in 2008, the ideals of
decentralisation, public consensus, and creating new trust models between parties conducting
transactions has been embraced. Principles of consensus, efficiency and mutual trust are
treasured by the community, as demonstrated by the rapid adoption of blockchain technology,
cryptocurrencies and other digital assets by both businesses and individuals in numerous
jurisdictions globally.

Token sales have captured imaginations, giving rise to a wide range of innovative new projects
and generating unexpectedly large amounts of funds. To date, over USD $3.4 billion has been
raised via token sales (source: Coindesk). The flexibility and speed to market of token sales has
created a fundamental change in fund raising, however, it comes with several associated risks.
Governments and regulators around the world have struggled to find a solution for dealing with
fund raising via token issuance without inhibiting business or the development of new technology.

At a high level, we can categorise three types of digital assets as follows:

(a) medium of exchange digital assets: these are digital coins and other digital
assets, such as Bitcoin, in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the
generation of units and verify their transfer. They operate independently of a central bank
or other issuer;

(b) utility tokens: these are digital assets that are intended to facilitate access to
services or units of services that can be purchased with those assets. These tokens can
be compared to API keys, used to access the service; and

(c) tokenised securities: these are digital assets that represent a regulated “security”
product in a particular jurisdiction. Regulations and structures vary widely, but generally,
this can capture products that are (or reflect interests in) shares, debentures, managed
investment schemes and structured products.

Digital assets can also serve as digital representations of tangible assets. There are also various
other possible types of digital assets and more will undoubtedly emerge.

2 Gibraltar - DLT Regulatory Framework

In January 2016, HM Government of Gibraltar published for consultation a document titled,
“Virtual Currency: Outline Regulatory Framework” for the consideration of regulating distributed
ledger technology (“DLT”) firms. After considering the feedback received, further detailed work
continued on this project. The consultation process indicated a strong preference from firms for
the GFSC to be the regulator for such activities."

’ http://www. fsc.gi/news/cryptocurrency-working-group-distributed-ledger-technology-dit-the-way-forward-231

GBX and Rock Token Sale Whitepaper Page 8
© GBX Limited
On 9 May 2017 the GFSC, in conjunction with HM Government of Gibraltar, published a
consultation paper entitled “Proposals for a DLT Regulatory Framework”.? The paper included
the “three pillars” of the desired regulatory outcomes and the “nine DLT principles”.

The consultation paper explored an approach to:

(a) provide regulatory certainty for DLT firms based in and operating from Gibraltar;

(b) provide a regulatory framework that recognises DLT is still a nascent technology that is
rapidly-evolving;

(c) provide a responsive regulatory framework;
(d) encourage growth in technology and fintech skills in the jurisdiction;
(e) provide sufficient flexibility to enable the effective regulation of novel business activities,

products, processes, and business models;

(f) enhance consumer confidence in dealing with properly regulated firms using novel
technology; and

(g) encourage DLT firms to be established in Gibraltar because there is an appropriate
regime for regulating their activities.

On 12 October 2017, HM Government of Gibraltar published the DLT Regulations.? The DLT
Regulations came into operation on 1 January 2018. When establishing the regulatory
framework HM Government of Gibraltar recognised that it should be flexible to adapt to new
cases and new uses of DLT and that it needed to be able to be applied to a wide variation of
DLT firms and, as such, the DLT Regulations are principles based as opposed to being
prescriptive.

The “nine DLT principles” require that a DLT firm must:
(a) conduct its business with honesty and integrity;

(b) pay due regard to the interests and needs of each and all its customers and must
communicate with its customers in a way which is fair, clear and not misleading;

(c) maintain adequate financial and non-financial resources;

(d) manage and control its business effectively, and conduct its business with due skill, care
and diligence, including having proper regard to risks to its business and customers;

(e) have effective arrangements in place for the protection of client assets and money when
it is responsible for them;

(f) have effective corporate governance arrangements;

(g) ensure that all systems and security access protocols are maintained to appropriate high
standards;

(h) have systems in place to prevent, detect and disclose financial crime risks such as

money laundering and terrorist financing; and

(i) be resilient and must develop contingency plans for the orderly and solvent winding down
of its business.

GBX, the “Crypto Harbour”

GBX is a member of the GSX group of companies, of which GSX Group Limited is ultimate
parent (“GSX Group”). GBX proposes to establish the Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange (GBX) and
seek approval from the Gibraltar regulator within Gibraltar’s DLT regulatory framework.

The aim is for GBX to become a fully integrated utility token sale platform and digital asset
exchange (“GBX Market”) licensed under the DLT regulations during the first half of 2018.

GBxX is in a unique position to offer the GBX Market within the environment of a stock exchange
and therefore provide much-needed anti-money laundering and know-your-customer
(“AML/KYC”) standards, quality control, accountability and transparency to the digital asset
market. With the corporate governance, management expertise and regulatory experience of the
GSX, GBX proposes to follow a similar governance and rules-based system for admission and
trading of digital assets and cryptocurrencies.

Further details regarding the GBX Market are described in Part B.

THE CRYPTO HARBOUR

A REGULATED
TOKEN SALE PLATFORM AND
GIBRALTAR BLOCKCHAIN EXCHANGE DIGITAL ASSET EXCHANGE

GSX, a stock exchange for tokenised securities
GBxX is a subsidiary of GSX.

GSX operates the Gibraltar Stock Exchange, a regulated market under European Union
regulations and is a member of both the Hyperledger Alliance and the Ethereum Enterprise
Alliance.

GSxX proposes to provide a blockchain-based exchange for capital markets and will aim to be the
world’s first stock exchange for tokenised securities (“GSX Tokenised Securities Exchange”) to
provide a new level of access, liquidity and transparency in the capital markets. Issuers of tokens
listed on GBX may have access to the GSX capital markets pathway, giving more options for
capital raising, and access to a more diverse investor base as they grow.

Further details regarding the GSX Tokenised Securities Exchange are described in Part C.

GIBRALTAR

STOCK EXCHANGE

GBX Ecosystem, the financial services and fintech ecosystem

GBX is expected to be different from other participants within the token and digital assets sector;
in addition to operating the GBX Market, and operating within the GSX Group that has the GSX
Tokenised Securities Exchange, it is also expected to have a financial services and fintech
ecosystem that will provide professional services to support a full spectrum of market participants
(“GBX Ecosystem’).

The total offering is envisaged to ultimately comprise of:

(a) the GBX Market;

(b) the GSX Tokenised Securities Exchange;

(c) fund services (operational now);

(d) corporate services (operational now);

(e) business solutions (operational now); and
(f) digital e-money institution.

The GBX Ecosystem will be launched using a phased development approach:

(i) the GBX Market commenced activities during December 2017;
(ii) the fund services, corporate services and business solutions are already
operational;

(iii) the GSX is operational and currently has the facility to list funds and debt and is
expected to launch the GSX Tokenised Securities Exchange during the latter
part of 2018; and

(iv) the digital e-money institution is an intended business line and is expected to be
launched during 2018.

Further details regarding the GBX Ecosystem are described in Part D and the phased
development approach is described in Part E.

GBX is also committed to the global blockchain community. GBX proposes to establish the GBX
Alliance, a forum for building consensus, confidence and trust within the community. It has
already established the GBX Blockchain Innovation Centre during September 2017 with the aim
of supporting blockchain businesses in Gibraltar. Further details regarding these initiatives are
described in Part F.

GBX and Rock Token Sale Whitepaper Page 11
© GBX Limited
The Rock Token

The functioning of GBX Market and the GBX Ecosystem is proposed to be supported by GBX’s
utility token: Rock Token.

Rock Token will be structured as an ERC-20 compliant token that may be used by holders to
access membership rights and use it as the preferred medium of exchange throughout the GBX
Market and the GBX Ecosystem.

Further details regarding the Rock Token are described in Part G.

The GBX vision

Bringing everything together, the GBX vision is to:

(a) regulated market: establish a marketplace for utility tokens and digital assets
operating within Gibraltar’s regulatory framework that is “first in class”;

(b) standards: create a high standard for entry and a controlled environment with rules for
admission and trading, with ongoing obligations and standards of conduct, under the
GBX Rules;

(c) quality and compliance: pioneer the development of high quality whitepapers with

standardised content and disclosure requirements while maintaining and ensuring
AML/KYC compliance;

(d) sustainable: implement an innovative staking mechanism, ensuring all members
have a shared ethos to grow a sustainable token and digital asset exchange ecosystem
within the DLT regulatory framework;

(e) liquidity and transparency: develop GSX as a marketplace for tokenised
securities, allowing for a new level of access, liquidity, and transparency to capital
markets;

(f) facilitation: use Rock Token as a medium of exchange within the GBX Market and

the GBX Ecosystem;

(g) membership benefits: enable Rock Token holders to exchange Rock Token for
membership benefits, which may include early access rights and potential incentives;

(h) confidence: build public trust and consensus, to support the ideals of the crypto-
movement and to establish confidence, credibility, and liquidity to the global crypto-
community; and

(i) inclusiveness: leverage the experience from both the finance industry and the
crypto-industry to enable GBX to be the bridge between the traditional financial industry
and the blockchain community, bringing greater acceptance and inclusion for participants
in the community from a unique institutional position.

GBX and Rock Token Sale Whitepaper Page 12

Part B — The GBX Market

This Part B sets out GBX’s aims in respect of the GBX Market, which consists of the token sale platform
and digital asset exchange for utility tokens, fully integrated within a single user sign-on and consolidated
in a single website and platform.

8 Token sale platform for utility tokens

To achieve its goals GBX will:

(a) create a platform that can list utility tokens;
(b) create a rules-based system;
(c) establish a network of firms to guide and advise token issuers through the listing process

(“Sponsors”);

(d) establish a network of ancillary services (in-house and external); and
(e) establish a network of users.
8.1 Create a token sale platform

GBX proposes to build a high-quality token listing platform.

By operating at a high standard and with token listing best practices, we are confident of
attracting the best quality token listings to GBX, which should in turn attract the best quality of
token buyers (both accredited and individual buyers). We expect this will result in an ecosystem
of quality token buyers and token issuers, with extensive global participation.

Key components of the GBX token sale platform include:

(a) operation: the GBX token sale platform will function via a website with a database
back-end, which means users access the platform through an external application;

(b) token admission: tokens will be admitted to the GBX token sale platform only after
successfully completing GBX’s compliance process;

(c) token sale payment types: at the initial stages of the GBX token sale platform,
token issuers will be able to receive Ether and/or Rock Tokens in consideration for their
token listing;

(d) tracking performance: token issuers will be able monitor the progress of their

token issuance via GBX’s Website and subsequently monitor the trading of their tokens
via GBX’s digital asset exchange;

(e) buyer deposits and withdrawals: token buyers will be able to deposit and
withdraw fiat currencies and tokens to and from their wallets;

(f) AMLI/KYC compliance: token buyers will be required to undergo AML/KYC
compliance procedures in order to open an account with GBX. Upon approval, token
issuers can then sell their tokens to AML/KYC compliant purchasers. This arrangement
should resolve common AML/KYC issues relating to public sales of tokens and allows for

GBX and Rock Token Sale Whitepaper Page 13
© GBX Limited
regulatory oversight over the token sale process by GBX acting within the framework of
Gibraltar’s DLT Regulations;

token buyer segmentation: token buyers will be segmented into various
categories, based on jurisdiction, professional or individual, and token buying
experience, which token issuers can then use to target buyer segments according to
their various legal/jurisdictional needs; and

security: security automation will be a core element of GBX’s systems to support its
security infrastructure (see Section 9(g)).

8.2 Establish clear requirements and a trusted listing process
(a) Admission and listing requirements

GBX will establish admission and listing requirements that will set out the process for the

listing and admission of tokens to market, as well as ongoing obligations for listing.

These codes will draw from community initiatives, “first in class” principles, and GSX best

practices.

More specifically, GBX will issue requirements relating to:

(i) the tokens themselves, including their admission, listing, trading and continuing
obligations;

(ii) Sponsors, such as eligibility and obligations; and

(iii) the operation of the GBX Market.

There will also be overarching requirements for all GBX Market participants.

(b) Trusted listing process

The expected process for listing tokens is summarised below:

(i) Appoint a Sponsor: all token issuers seeking admission of their tokens to
GBX (“Applicants”) must appoint a Sponsor who is responsible for reporting to
GBX on all matters pertaining to the application, listing, and continuing
obligations of all tokens admitted to the official list. Sponsors will need to
conduct thorough due diligence on Applicants in accordance with standardised
criteria.

(ii) Prepare a whitepaper and terms: all Applicants must publish a
whitepaper and terms of sale with minimum content and disclosure
requirements. GBX will publish its expectations and requirements to assist
Applicants, Sponsors and their advisors with their preparation and submission.

(iii) Submit documentation: the Sponsor will submit the application to GBX.

(iv) Review by GBX: the application will be subject to review by GBX. Comments
on the application are expected to be returned to the Sponsor within 10 business
days of the first submission and 5 business days on any subsequent
submission, but are subject to change depending on volume and the matters
raised. Once comments are cleared, GBX will proceed to approval.

(v) Approval: GBX will inform the Sponsor when the application is approved. The
whitepaper is published by GBX on its Website.

GBX and Rock Token Sale Whitepaper Page 14

© GBX Limited
(vi) Listed and admission to trading: the token issuer will set the token
offering period. Once the token offering period has completed, the approved
token can be traded on the secondary market of the GBX Market in accordance
with the GBX Rules.

(vii) Issuance: the tokens are issued.

Existing tokens listed and trading on other exchanges can also apply to be approved and
admitted by GBX to its digital asset exchange but will have to comply with the GBX
Rules in order to be admitted to trading.

8.3 Establish a network of Sponsors

GBX will play an important role in the global blockchain community and Sponsors will form an
integral part of such a role.

Sponsors have a duty to uphold the quality, reputation and integrity of the GBX Market. They will
play a crucial role in maintaining quality in the market and, in particular, are responsible for
critically assessing the appropriateness of an Applicant for admission.

Sponsors will be required to ensure the Applicant meets the GBX eligibility criteria, is suitable for
admission, and to assess the likelihood of an Applicant affecting the integrity and reputation of
GBxX. A vital component of such determination is the due-diligence process that Sponsors will be
required to undertake.

GBX and Rock Token Sale Whitepaper Page 15
© GBX Limited

PA

GBX proposes to require Sponsors to:

(a) conduct due diligence: adopt a consistent set of key due diligence parameters in
accordance with the GBX requirements. Sponsors will be required to conduct due
diligence on the Applicant's senior management and controllers (including directors,
shareholders and beneficial owners) as well as consider in detail, aspects of the
Applicant's legal, financial and commercial proposition, and the viability of the Project as
a whole. The use of accredited third party due-diligence providers to provide detailed
commercial compliance reports may, in certain cases, be required;

(b) advise Applicants and liaise with GBX: be responsible for advising Applicants
on their obligations and guiding them through the admission process. Sponsors are also
responsible for dealing with GBX on all matters relating to the application, listing, and
continuing obligations of tokens admitted to the official list; and

(c) fit and proper: have appropriate financial and personnel resources for the role that
they are to perform. They must be fit and proper, have appropriate organisational
arrangements, and will be required to undertake to GBX to accept and discharge those
responsibilities at all times to the satisfaction of GBX.

Drawing from “first in class” principles and GSX best practices, GBX envisages establishing a
trusted network of Sponsors who will play a crucial role in maintaining the quality of the GBX
Market. GBX will set eligibility criteria and a code of conduct with the aim of attracting world
class, proven experts in the token sale sector.

Innovative fee and staking mechanisms will help ensure Sponsors have a shared ethos to grow
GBX with responsibility and accountability. The specific mechanisms envisaged are as follows
(See Part G for more details):

(i) Fee payment - Fees paid by an Applicant to a Sponsor should include at
least 20% of the total fees payable to the Sponsor for non-disbursement fees
paid in the Applicant’s tokens. The Sponsor will be obliged to hold these tokens
for a minimum of 6 months when vesting (or “lock-up”) restrictions will be lifted.

(ii) Staking — In addition, each Sponsor will stake a fixed amount of Rock Tokens
(to be held in GBX escrow) for 12 months, equivalent to 0.5% of the total tokens
issued through each token sale that they are sponsoring and which are admitted
to trading on GBX.

The full details of the Sponsor rules and application requirements will be released in the separate
“Sponsor Rules” once finalised.

Presently, there is interest from more than 20 well-qualified organisations to be Sponsors. More
are expected to be added over time.

8.4 Establish the GBX Ecosystem

The GBX Ecosystem is expected to be a network of ancillary services both in-house and external
to support the GBX token sale platform, from payment facilities to company formation and due-
diligence services. This is described further in Part D.
GBX aims to work only with the highest quality firms to assist token issuers and the development
of the community in general. By doing so, GBX will form a centre for excellence for token
issuance and token sales.

For the GBX token sale market to operate effectively the market will require participants
(“users”). GBX is committed to creating a broad base and efficient marketplace for both buyers
and sellers.

GBX’s token sale platform will be designed to be user-friendly for both issuers and users. For
example:

(a) categorising tokens: token issuances are proposed to be categorised to allow users
to filter token listings by individual or multiple criteria, such as, geography and activity,
experience in participating in token sales, accredited institution or individual, in order to
identify their preferred choice of token. This will aim to allow token issuers to be able to
target the right kind of participants based on their business or legal requirements.

(b) communication: the GBX platform’s messaging service will allow users to contact
token issuers directly;

(c) ease of use: users will be able to deposit and withdraw fiat currencies and tokens to
and from their account, and will be able to acquire token issuances via “one-click”
participation;

(d) AMLI/KYC standards: all users of GBX’s token sale platform will have to pass
AML/KYC compliance standards. They will have assurance that they have an account in
a regulated token sale market along with other users that have also passed the same
AML/KYC compliance standards.

The functionality and controls of the token sale platform will not alone be sufficient to attract
users. A marketplace is created by buyers and sellers. Therefore, token issuers and users need
to be aware that the GBX token sale platform exists. GBX has a public relations program and
media strategy, as well as community and content managers who will raise awareness of GBX
within the crypto-community. GBX will produce content and news on leading social media
platforms including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub, Telegram, Reddit, as well as other
social community channels and newspaper publications. GBX will also generate news and
awareness with respect to its token sale platform via its community initiatives including, but not
limited to, the GBX Blockchain Innovation Centre.

All activities and opportunities for access will be subject to applicable law. This means, for
example, that GBX may limit participation access to all or certain tokens in order to comply with
the laws of other jurisdictions.

“The GBX marketplace is
akin to issuing tokens into
a large pool of

AML/KYC cleared buyers”

- Nick Cowan Group CEO

Digital asset exchange

GBX’s digital asset exchange is expected to connect buyers and sellers in the secondary trading
market to buy, sell, or exchange digital assets and cryptocurrencies for other digital assets and
cryptocurrencies, or for fiat currency, utilising the single user sign-on more fully explained and
highlighted in Section 8.

(a)

(c)

Products

Users will be able to buy major digital assets, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, Ripple,
and Litecoin that have perceived strong credibility, user base, and liquidity along with
tokens listed on GBX’s token sale platform.

Different tokens are expected to be incrementally added over time as the token sale
platform and digital asset exchange develops.

Integration with the GBX token sale platform

GBX’s token sale platform and digital asset exchange are expected to be operated as an
integrated system which will share the same website with a database back-end and
blockchain connectivity.

The Website will be user friendly, and will host a range of trading features for traders and
casual users alike, including ‘beginner friendly” functions. The digital asset exchange
aims to be open constantly, and have customer service and multi-language capability.

User deposits and withdrawals

Users are expected to be able to fund their wallet with digital assets and fiat currency
(major currencies such as USD, GBP and EUR) via various methods of payment
including debit and credit cards, wire transfer, and payment service providers.

Users are also expected to be able to store, send and receive digital assets, view
account balances, manage portfolios, and trade digital assets via their wallet.

Trading interface

GBX envisages that the digital asset exchange will support web-based trading, as well
as desktop applications and will have multi-language support.

AML/KYC compliance

As highlighted in Section 8.1(f), users must pass AML/KYC compliance before they are
permitted to open an account, after which they will be able to fund their wallet up to
agreed limits (based on the assessment of the user at the point of account opening and
subsequent review as applicable).

GBX will adopt ‘first in class” AML/KYC policies and procedures; for example, users will
only be able to withdraw fiat to an agreed account in the name of the user with a
reputable bank. The AML/KYC compliance process should protect the exchange and its
users against the risks associated with a poorly controlled environment. Subject to legal
and regulatory restrictions, GBX expects to on-board retail and professional users alike
who may open an account with fiat and/or digital assets, subject to passing applicable
on-boarding and AML/KYC compliance requirements.

GBX and Rock Token Sale Whitepaper Page 18

Market operation and fees

GBX will endeavour to make a market in all tokens that are admitted to trading. In
addition, GBX will seek strategic relationships with other exchanges, aiming to enable
dual listing of tokens to increase liquidity and price transparency. However, ultimately the
market and not GBX will set the prices within the exchange.

The market will operate by matching buyers and sellers via “one-click” trading
technology. Matching engine technology facilitate fast and robust trading of digital
assets, aiming to ensure that GBX has a fast execution speed, price/time matching and
permit an order book for trading with depth. The aim is that tokens will be matched by the
system on the basis of users offering a number of tokens to buy/sell at a set price for a
duration of time determined by the token holder.

GBX’s digital asset exchange will have low transaction fees for holders and users of
Rock Token. GBX’s digital asset exchange may have geographical restrictions in respect
of specific user functions and product availability that may only be accessible from

certain jurisdictions.

Security

GBX will employ air gaps and other security protocols to minimise the risk of theft. GBX
will adopt a multisig wallet security system whereby tokens deposited at GBX will be
secured in various multisig wallets; and the majority of tokens will be stored offline in cold
storage, while a small proportion of the tokens will remain in hot online storage allowing
for faster transactions for users who perform deposits and withdrawals on the digital
asset exchange. Wallets will be multi-layer and allow for storing and trading between
tokens listed on GBX.

Limits
GBX will impose various limits on trading as well as on the purchase and sale of

particular digital assets, based on operational, market integrity, legal and regulatory
requirements. Not all digital assets will be available to all users.

Part C — The GSX Tokenised Securities Exchange

This Part C sets out GBX’s vision in respect of the GSX Tokenised Securities Exchange.
10 Overview

GBX and GSX clearly distinguish between utility tokens (which includes medium-of-exchange
tokens) and tokenised securities.

GBxX is the planned regulated marketplace for utility tokens, with GSX planned to be the
regulated marketplace for tokenised securities.

11 About GSX

The following chart provides an overview of the key aspects of GSX and its proposed overall
product scope and structure.

GSxX is licensed and regulated by the GFSC under licence number FSC123B (issued on 11
November 2014).

GSX operates two markets:

(a) GSX Main Market, an EU regulated market recognised by ESMA and by the
United Kingdom’s tax authority (HMRC) under $1005 (1)(b) Income Tax Act 2007 for
funds and debt securities; and

(b) GSX Global Market, a self-regulated market which is a Multilateral Trading Facility
(MTF) as defined under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2004/39/EC
(MiFID) for funds and debt securities.

As a relatively new exchange, GSX has had the opportunity to develop fresh practices and
build new infrastructure rather than being hampered by legacy systems. GSX aims to take this
one step further by becoming one of the world’s first tokenised securities exchange, providing
a new level of market efficiency, access, liquidity, and transparency in the capital markets. By
GSX implementing a blockchain solution, GSX plans to build a secure and controlled
environment for the issuance, trading, and holding of tokenised securities for market
participants who have passed AML/KYC compliance.

GBX and Rock Token Sale Whitepaper Page 20

12 About the GSX Tokenised Securities Exchange
12.1. Key features

The GSX Tokenised Securities Exchange is planned to function as a transparent auditable
ledger such that participants will be registered holders of the tokenised securities at every
stage of the trading process.

This is by virtue of utilising the record-keeping functionality of DLT for the benefit of the
exchange, issuers, the participants and regulators alike.

The GSX Tokenised Securities Exchange is expected to provide access to the capital markets
for a wide variety of issuers and participants including:

(a) traditional and non-traditional counterparts including global conglomerates,
institutional licensees, operating companies, family businesses, investment vehicles,
family offices, and ETFs; and

(b) participants who can trade within the GSX marketplace and build investment
portfolios with confidence and without the layers of intermediaries, barriers to entry,
and cost associated with traditional markets. This has the potential to give
participants access to a spectrum of investments, capital, and/or income generating
assets that might not otherwise be possible in the same manner and to the same
degree under a traditional stock exchange model.

With the adoption of the blockchain-based trading system, the GSX Tokenised Securities
Exchange will dramatically boost efficiencies whilst reducing costs by integrating the entire
spectrum of exchange services including, but not limited to, listing, execution, clearing,
settlement, AML/KYC controls and processes, security, digital identity management and
custody.

12.2 Timing and progress

We aim to be able to list tokenised securities by Q3 2018, while employing a blockchain-
based trading system for such tokenised securities by Q4 2018.

We are already in the design phase of a blockchain-based trading system that will be able to
offer all the benefits and effectiveness of the DLT, while ensuring such securities remain
registered and compliant under current EU Securities regulations during secondary trading.

12.3 Opportunities for GBX listed token issuers

GSX aims to open up new markets and create new opportunities for collaboration. It will also
serve as the next destination point for tokens listed on the GBX digital asset exchange.

As the token issuers of the GBX token listings grow in their business, they may apply to list a
security token on the GSX Tokenised Securities Exchange and get further access to capital
raising opportunities.

Issuers that are listed on the GBX digital asset exchange will receive fast-track access, with
faster processing times, to list security tokens on the GSX Tokenised Securities Exchange,
giving more options to raise capital. They will also have access to a more diverse investor
base as they grow including possible dual listing opportunities on other stock exchanges.

Part D —- The GBX Ecosystem

This Part D sets out GBX’s vision in respect of the GBX Ecosystem.

13 GBX Ecosystem
13.1. Overview

GBX envisages creating the GBX Ecosystem, a financial services and fintech ecosystem with
multiple products and services.

GBX Comprehensive Ecosystem
is expected to include:

* Token Sale Platform

* Digital Asset Exchange
* Fund Services

* Corporate Services

* Business Solutions

* E-Money Services

The GBX Ecosystem is expected to consist of three divisions:

1) Exchange Division

2) Services Division

3) E-Money Division

It is intended that the entire GBX Ecosystem will make use of DLT, initially by both GBX and

GSX, and thereafter by the other members of the GBX Ecosystem with an initial focus on
AMLIKYC, settlement and clearing.

GBX and Rock Token Sale Whitepaper Page 22
© GBX Limited
13.2

13.3

Services Division (Juno Services)

The services division comprises a unique offering within a stock exchange eco-system
including company formation and supporting services, fund services (fund establishment and
administration), business solutions (securitisation, advisory and regulatory) and support.

Juno

services

The services division includes Juno Fund Services Limited, Juno Fiduciary Services Limited
and its licensed nominee and company manager subsidiaries (collectively, “Juno Services’),
all of which are former Grant Thornton‘ service lines that were acquired by GBX on 30
November 2017. The former Grant Thornton service lines are existing businesses with over
10 years operational history.

The key entities are as follows.

(a) Juno Fund Services Limited is licensed by the GFSC, licence number
FSC00926B, to carry on business as a Collective Investment Scheme Administrator.
The business line provides services to funds of varying asset classes (conventional
“trading” funds, alternatives and DLT/crypto funds) and jurisdictions (Gibraltar, Malta,
BVI and Cayman Islands).

(b) Juno Fiduciary Services Limited is licensed by the GFSC, licence number
FSC006038, to carry on business as a Company Manager. The business line
provides corporate services to the GBX Ecosystem, its users and participants.

(c) Juno Nominees Limited is licensed by the GFSC, licence number FSC00604B,
to carry on business as a Company Manager restricted to the provision of nominee
shareholdings.

(d) Juno Management Limited is licensed by the GFSC, licence number
FSCOO605B, to carry on business as a Company Manager restricted to the provision
of directorships.

(e) Juno Solutions Limited will provide solutions and services to clients of the GBX
Ecosystem, its users and participants on an ad hoc basis with a focus on token issues
and regulatory support.

(f) Juno Support Limited will provide back office support to the exchange, services
and e-money divisions.

The Juno Services businesses will not be funded by any of the proceeds of the Token Sale.
E-Money Division (digital e-money institution)

The e-money division is expected to consist of a digital e-money institution.

4 Grant Thornton’ service lines consist of Grant Thornton Fund Administration Limited, GT Fiduciary Services Limited, GT

Nominees Limited and GT Management Limited, former members of the Grant Thornton Gibraltar Group of Companies.

GBX and Rock Token Sale Whitepaper

Page 23
A digital e-money institution would facilitate the smooth transaction of business and would
serve to make the GBX Ecosystem stronger. From a commercial point of view, a digital e-
money institution could on-board and provide services for issuers, users, participants and
clients of the ecosystem.

A digital e-money institution could facilitate currency exchange, peer-to-peer payments and
peer—to-business payments for fiat and digital assets alike. The e-money institution could also
support Rock Token and permit users to store and trade tokens, digital assets on GBX and
tokenised securities on GSX via their e-money wallet.

The digital e-money institution would be regulated by and be subject to the authority of the
GFSC, and potentially other regulators.

14 Gibraltar fintech ecosystem
Gibraltar is positioning itself to become a global fintech hub and the assent to law of the DLT
Regulations on 12 October 2017 supports this development.
It is GBX’s view that there are four critical elements that establish and develop a fintech
ecosystem:
(a) business environment/access to markets;
(b) government and regulatory support;
(c) access to capital; and
(d) financial and technical expertise.
Gibraltar is seeing growth in the fintech sector with many fintech institutions choosing
Gibraltar as a place to do business. For example, Gnosis, Xapo and Wavecrest, along with
some of the largest e-gaming companies in the world including bwin.party, 888.com and
Bet365 operate from Gibraltar.
Gibraltar has a supportive government and regulator, a favourable fiscal environment, access
to a large pool of talent built upon the financial services and e-sectors and access to markets.
The GBX Ecosystem intends to create fintech synergies and integration between GBX, GSX
and members of the GBX Ecosystem to enable development of products, services and
growth.

Phased development approach

The GBX Market, the GSX Tokenised Securities Exchange and the GBX Ecosystem are
expected to be built via a phased development approach at appropriate intervals as and when
technology and control systems are developed, tested and approved for adoption and
integration.

Regulatory applications will be submitted to the GFSC in respect of GBX, GSX (licence
extension for tokenised securities), and digital e-money institution.

The authorisation of any licensed activity, including extension, will be subject to the approval
of the GFSC at the appropriate time based on the merits of the respective request for
authorisation. Other licences and approvals in other jurisdictions may be sought in due
course, subject to legal and regulatory advice, as well as business need.

GBX proposes to fund these costs primarily using the proceeds of the Token Sale, and with
support from the excess capital of the GSX Group if the Token Sale target is not reached.

In the long term, GBX expects the proposed various revenue streams of the GBX Market, the
GSX Tokenised Securities Exchange, and the GBX Ecosystem should maintain its
sustainability and ensure the long-term goals of GBX are achieved.

Part F - Community, the GBX Alliance, the GBX
Alliance Council and the GBX Blockchain Innovation
Centre

This Part F sets out GBX’s vision in respect of the blockchain community, the GBX Alliance, the GBX
Alliance Council and the GBX Blockchain Innovation Centre to serve the blockchain community.

17 Community

GBX considers the well-being of the global blockchain community to be of paramount
importance. Core to GBX’s business purpose and objective is:

(a) building public trust and consensus;

(b) supporting some of the key principles important to the community;
(c) establishing confidence in and credibility of the digital assets; and
(d) ensuring maximum liquidity in the crypto-market.

The global token sale and digital asset market is experiencing a period of significant risk and
uncertainty; GBX is intent on serving the community and creating a regulated business
environment with corporate responsibility and community involvement to support the growth of
the new digital economy.

With the aim of serving the blockchain community, GBX will establish the GBX Alliance; and
has already established the GBX Blockchain Innovation Centre during September 2017.

18 GBX Alliance

The GBX Alliance will be “established with the community for the community” to support the
development of the new digital economy in Gibraltar. The GBX Alliance will be formed from a
cross-section of the community with international participants as well as those from Gibraltar.

The GBX Alliance will be a forum for high-level discussions, for building consensus,
confidence and trust and for developing thought leadership. It is expected to support the
following:

(a) promote and support the Gibraltar DLT sector: support the promotion of
Gibraltar as a DLT centre of excellence, promote adherence of the “nine DLT
principles” of the DLT Regulations and provide a forum through which all can express
and represent views in relation to the DLT sector in Gibraltar, including current issues,
development, regulatory developments and building Gibraltar as a DLT centre of
excellence;

(b) communication and advocacy channels: encourage an exchange of
information and provide a channel of communication with the relevant authorities and
professional bodies in Gibraltar and elsewhere in order to achieve common goals and
provide input on regulatory and legislative matters relating to DLT;

(c) discussion and cooperation: provide a forum for members of the GBX Alliance

and the community to discuss matters of mutualinterest and promote cooperation and

GBX and Rock Token Sale Whitepaper Page 27
© GBX Limited
respect between members of the GBX Alliance and the crypto-communhity in general;
and

(d) education: encourage and promote the continuing education of members of the
GBX Alliance and the community in general by providing training and guest speakers
on current and suggested programmes.

19 GBX Alliance Council
The GBX Alliance Council will be formed from the GBX Alliance.

The GBX Alliance Council will be a small body of persons, chosen from members of the GBX
Alliance, who will work with GBX to provide advice on both the content and the
implementation of GBX Rules.
As a key adviser to GBX in respect of GBX requirements, the GBX Alliance Council is planned
to be kept separate and distinct from Sponsors to ensure impartiality, a fair evaluation
process, and respected advice.
Given its advisory role on some fundamentally important aspects of the governance of GBX
and the operation of its market, it is important that the GBX Alliance Council draws its
membership from a wide cross-section of persons and professions, both locally in Gibraltar
and internationally.
20 GBX Blockchain Innovation Centre
GBX established the GBX Blockchain Innovation Centre on 18 September 2017.
The GBX Blockchain Innovation Centre has been established with the aim of enabling
Gibraltar to be the world’s most connected tech community, by bringing customers together
with fast-growth tech companies and world-class talent whilst providing infrastructure support.
The aim is to create a centre for the blockchain community in Gibraltar, providing a dynamic
workspace, an active events calendar and world class facilities to help businesses achieve
scale.
GBX and Rock Token Sale Whitepaper Page 28

© GBX Limited
The vision for the GBX Blockchain Innovation Centre is to:
(a) promote and be a driving force for blockchain innovation;

(b) foster the creation of new applications for DLT / blockchain technology with the aim of
helping people realise their ideas for new businesses;

(c) act as a centre for the development of new protocols, applications, and software
related to DLT / blockchain technology; and

(d) welcome proposals and proofs of concept related to any aspect of functionality or
area of the DLT industry.

The GBX Blockchain Innovation Centre is expected to work closely with the GFSC and
Gibraltar Finance Centre to ensure consistency of message in marketing Gibraltar as a
friendly crypto-enabled jurisdiction. It is part of GBX’s commitment to the community to
embrace and improve new technology and drive forward innovation and will promote
collaboration and networking, build partnerships, facilitate sound investment and create
employment.

Membership of the GBX Blockchain Innovation Centre is free of charge. Technology firms,
developers, and investors are all welcome to join.

The GBX Blockchain Innovation Centre is expected to host conferences, seminars, lectures,
panels, meet-ups, hackathons, and competitions. The GBX Blockchain Innovation Centre
hosted its first international event, the Blockathon, with the Broctagon Fintech Group’s
innovation centre in Delhi, India, on 28 October 2017. Similar events are already being
planned with partners in London, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Canada.

Hyperledger project (“Hyperledger”), followed by the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance during
November 2017 and is also collaborating with the IOTA Foundation for research in
conjunction with the GBX Blockchain Innovation Centre. Amongst other things, Hyperledger
aims to build an open source DLT framework and code base, allowing organisations to create
specific applications, platforms, and hardware systems to help support industry specific
business transactions. In the spirit of Hyperledger membership, the GBX Blockchain
Innovation Centre is demonstrating a very early stage bond-trading platform at bond.bic.gi.

GBX intends to support technology development initiatives and values in its engagement with
the wider community. It will allocate human and capital resources to the development of new
technology at the GBX Blockchain Innovation Centre, invite engagement on guiding the
governance of its platform via the GBX Alliance and the GBX Alliance Council, and work with
the wider Gibraltar and international communities as the blockchain industry grows.

Part G — The Rock Token

This Part G describes the key aspects of the proposed Rock Token and the Token Sale.

21 Overview
The functioning of GBX, GSX and the GBX Ecosystem are proposed to be supported by
GBX’s utility token: the Rock Token.
The Rock Token is an ERC-20 compliant token to be issued on the Ethereum blockchain, and
used and accepted throughout the GBX, GSX and the GBX Ecosystem.
The ERC-20 token standard prescribes the functions that a token on the Ethereum blockchain
should incorporate to enable the issuance, distribution and control of tokens in a standardised
manner. It is a set of guidelines that a token issue contract should adhere to in order to be
compatible with most wallet software. The Rock Token contract will adhere to the ERC-20
token standard by declaring six standardised function names and two standardised event
handles. This standardisation makes it easy for decentralised application developers to utilise
Rock Token in the future and ensure maximum exposure and adoption.
22 Utility token
The Rock Token is considered to be a “utility token” and is intended to be used for:
(a) settling of the GBX application fee ("Application Fee"), listing fees (“Listing Fees”)
and Sponsor fees (“Sponsor Fees”) on GBX;
(b) staking by Sponsors on GBX;
(c) settling trading fees (“Trading Fees”) on the GBX Market;
(d) medium to pay fees in the GBX Ecosystem including corporate services, fund
services, business solutions and e-money services;
(e) GBX Blockchain Innovation Centre campaigns, rewards for GBX Blockchain
Innovation Centre campaigns and other incentives.
It is also planned to provide:
(f) membership to GBX, with privileged account benefits including potential discounts;
(g) priority access to token sales; and
(h) other potential incentives and voting rights on select community initiatives and
developments;
in each case subject to further consideration and legal and regulatory advice.
GBX and Rock Token Sale Whitepaper Page 31

© GBX Limited
*An indication of the proposed Application Fee, Listing Fees, Sponsor Fees and Trading Fees is set out
in the Appendix. The full details of fees and application requirements as well as the mechanism of the
staking model and token utility will be further detailed in the separate GBX Rules.

Wy LISTING FEES
2 TOKEN PURCHASERS

243 sponsor FEES

e TRADING FEES

Given the expected coherence of interests among Rock Token holders, it is our view that GBX
can be properly thought of as a community, with the following intended initial model:

€)RECKTSKEN

22.1 Member use

° Member classification: a person may apply to open an account with GBX,
subject to compliance with applicable AML/KYC and other procedures, and any
restrictions imposed by GBX. All approved GBX account holders (wallets) will be
classed as “Members”.

. Account opening gift: following the successful opening of an account, a Member
will be granted 1 RKT as a gift.

. Participation in “early-access” public sales: any Member that holds a
balance equal to or greater than USD $1,000 equivalent of RKT, will be eligible to
access a higher membership tier, which entitles participation in the “early-access”
public sale of any token sale using the GBX platform. This period is expected to be a
period of 24 hours before the general public sale date, and all token sales in this
period must be paid for using RKT.

° Trading Fees: Members will have the option of holding a minimum amount (such
amount to be determined in due course) of RKT and utilising it to pay their Trading
Fees, which may result in a lower overall transactional cost.

22.2 Issuer use

. Issuer classification: a person may become a GBxX issuer by listing a token on
the GBX digital asset exchange, subject to compliance with the GBX Rules.

° Listing payments: an issuer must settle the Application Fee and Listing Fee in
RKT. The Listing Fee is expected to comprise:

° the GBX listing fee (85% of the total face value of the Listing Fees); and

° the staked RKT (15% of the total face value of the Listing Fees). Staked RKT
is proposed to be held in escrow and returned after 24 months if the issuer
has complied with its obligations. However, if it fails to do so, GBX will not
return the RKT and it may be used for other purposes.

GBX and Rock Token Sale Whitepaper Page 32
© GBX Limited
22.3. Sponso

The Appendix sets out the expected initial Application Fee and Listing Fee.

Minimum token sale proceeds in RKT: an issuer that lists on the GBX digital
asset exchange must raise at least 10% of the value of tokens in RKT. If the actual
sale proceeds collected from the sale are in other forms of payment, then the issuer
will have to purchase the shortfall of RKT to top it up to 10%.

Issuer staking of RKT: an issuer will stake by permitting GBX to hold in escrow
half of the Rock Tokens required to be raised as described above, for a period of 12
months. The issuer-staked RKT will be repayable in four equal proportions, paid
quarterly, the first quarter being 3 months after the admission to trading of the tokens.
The amounts staked will be held by GBX as part of a claims mechanism for any
resolution of disputes between market participants and the issuer. GBX retains the
right to change staking requirements as needed or consider lowering the staking
requirements to 2.5% of the amount raised.

ruse

Sponsor classification: a person may be approved as a Sponsor as described

Part H — Corporate Governance, GBX Team and
Advisors

This Part H provides information about GBX’s corporate governance arrangements and the key team
members and advisors that are involved in the Project.

27 Corporate governance

27.1 ‘First in class” corporate governance
The GSX Group has adopted and embraced a ‘first in class” principles-based approach to
corporate governance. The approach promotes and guides the behaviour of those responsible
for corporate governance in order to achieve the purpose and objectives of GBX, GSX, and
the GBX Ecosystem.

The six overarching principles of the corporate governance approach are:

Leadership Ethics, Honesty and Integrity

Leaders shall lead with the intent of meeting
the business purpose and objectives of the
ecosystem in both the short and long term.

Leaders shall ensure that the business of the
ecosystem is conducted in an ethical, fair and
transparent manner. Leaders shall act with
honesty and integrity in every walk of life.

Capability

Leaders shall have an appropriate mix of
knowledge, skills, qualifications and
experience to enable them to discharge their
duties and responsibilities effectively.

Sustainability

Leaders shall guide the business of the
ecosystem to create value and allocate it fairly
and sustainably to ensure that adequate financial
and non-financial resources are maintained.

Accountability

Leaders shall be accountable and shall
communicate to stakeholders at regular
intervals, a fair and balanced assessment of
how the ecosystem is achieving its business
purpose and objectives.

Community

Leaders shall ensure that they uphold and protect
the interests of the communities in which the
ecosystem operates and safeguard the
reputation and integrity of Gibraltar and the global
blockchain community.

The principles are intended to contribute to open and dynamic practices so that those
responsible for corporate governance can focus on how to best apply them to achieve the
business purpose and objectives. A robust internal control system will be adopted with
policies and procedures that manage risk and ensure consistency in the quality of service
being provided at all times to all stakeholders. Control systems will be designed to ensure the
standards of regulation and compliance are applied to all business areas including adherence
to the “nine DLT principles” of the DLT Regulations (where applicable).

Management will be organised such that clear goals are set, with feasible strategies to
achieve the goals, an appropriate organisation structure to deliver the goals and appropriate
reporting and controls to monitor performance. Irrespective of the fact that the interests of
stakeholders may be different, the corporate governance approach will treat all stakeholders
with equal concern and respect. The tone and culture of the ecosystem will be set from the
top with ‘first in class” corporate governance principles being encouraged throughout.

Conclusion

In less than 10 years since the invention of Bitcoin, decentralisation and the rapid adoption of the
blockchain has created opportunities to develop and change the way we live and work, giving rise to
innovative ways to raise capital via token sales.

On 12 October 2017, HM Government of Gibraltar published the DLT Regulations. Gibraltar is
positioning itself as a world leader in innovation, embracing change by creating a regulated
environment in which distributed ledger technology can flourish.

GBX and GSX, the Gibraltar Stock Exchange, have a unique objective, to be one of the world first
licensed and regulated exchanges for both utility tokens and tokenised securities, operating entirely
on the blockchain.

Using a Sponsor-based rules system, a strict due diligence process and strong conduct principles, a
market place will be created where issuers, traders and investors can participate with confidence and
trust.

To support our expansion, GBX will issue its utility token, the Rock Token, providing membership and
access to our exchanges and financial services ecosystem. Contributors to the Token Sale can take the
opportunity to become an early adopter of what is likely to be a significantly disruptive capital market.
GBX, together with the Rock Token, signals the dawning of a new era of best practices in the token sale
space. Greater disclosures and transparency, coupled with innovative staking mechanisms, should lead
to a higher quality market place for issuers and participants.

We are committed to the crypto-revolution and bring to the world our newest market, GBX, the Gibraltar
Blockchain Exchange, which along with GSX, the Gibraltar Stock Exchange, provide a stamp of
excellence to attract viable high quality tokens and securities listings with supporting exchange
infrastructure for the entire crypto-community. We will aim for the highest standards, on the principles
of trust and credibility, and bring institutional respectability and recognition to the millions of crypto-
users all over the world. We welcome you to join in our journey and acquire a unique token that will
help contribute to enhanced disclosure, transparency and confidence. RKT, the Rock Token.

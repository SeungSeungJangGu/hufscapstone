1 SUMMARY

The Dero Project has written a unique new blockchain technology that is
based on the DAG and CryptoNote protocol with double spend protection.
DERO is a new, experimental blockchain technology written in Golang with
a focus on enhanced Privacy and Smart Contracts while maintaining the
transparency and security of the blockchain.

The goal is to create a unique state of the art blockchain technology with
enhanced Reliability, Privacy, Security, Usability, and Portability by bring-
ing together some of the best proven technologies like CryptoNote Protocol
and Smart Contracts, thereby allowing for the creation of Private Smart
Contracts.

Blockchain is an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions
etween two parties efficiently, and in a verifiable and permanent way.

CryptoNote Protocol uses a distributed public ledger that records all
alances and transactions of its in-built currency like Bitcoin. Unlike Bitcoin,
CryptoNote’s transactions cannot be followed through the blockchain in a
way that reveals who sent or received coins. The only people with access to
che whole set of data about a transaction are the sender or receiver of the
ransaction.

A smart Contract is a protocol intended to facilitate, verify, and enforce
che negotiation or execution of a digital contract. Smart contracts allow
for direct contract execution without a third party. These transactions are
‘rackable and irreversible. Smart contracts were first proposed by Nick Szabo
in 1994.

Tact see:

e Smart Contract

Some brief examples of what a smart contract is capable of managing
without third-party intervention include: access authorization to a physical
object like a building or internet-of-things (IoT) devices, asset management,
rading, ticket purchasing, or share distribution. In some instances, an indi-
vidual or organization would prefer not to reveal the details of the transaction
or contract (i.e. participants, amounts, and contract terms) to the rest of
che world. Dero brings true privacy to smart contracts for the first time on
any blockchain.

Truly private smart contracts are a unique feature offered by DERO that
other projects to date (October 2, 2018) do not offer. Dero accomplishes
chis by keeping all aspects of the transaction, smart contract, and users
details private on the original blockchain without the need to trust sensitive
or otherwise private information to second layer or off-chain solutions.

2 CHALLENGES

2.1 Identification and know-your-client (KYC)

Having briefly touched upon the need for privacy on the blockchain we must
also address the need for some degree of transparency in certain limited
situations. Dero will allow thoroughly verified and publicly known certifying
authorities to add their signature to individual wallets, and only for those
who have applied. This signature serves as confirmation that your identity
has been verified by a certifying authority such as a Government, Bank,
telecom operator, Visa, Mastercard, or other organizations as required.

When a service provider require verification of your KYC details, similar
to what weve seen with exchanges, the process can now be made as simple as
using a wallet with the appropriate certification. The service provider, ven-
dor, or payment gateway will only get to see a basic signature that confirms
it is authorized to use their services. No personal details are available in
these situations. Only certifying authorities will have personal information
for individual wallets and only with those who have submitted an application.

In places where KYC compliance is at its most stringent levels, trades
would not be possible without pre-authorization from the appropriate au-
thorities. On an individual level, you can choose whom you certify your
wallet with, at your discretion. Given the need for robust privacy and secu-
rity, DERO blockchain has been designed to allow full integration of hardware
wallets with biometric protection.

2.2 Voting using safe, secure, and transparent smart
contracts

Any organization may use DERO blockchain for a safe, secure, and trans-
parent voting process that also keeps the identities of all voters anonymous
in the eyes of the public. This is achieved through a type of private voting
smart contract that is only made possible today on DERO blockchain. Aside
from Dero, current voting solutions to date operate on public ledgers with
public smart contracts that dont obfuscate or shroud your network traffic
from identification. Some workaround solutions have been proposed, such as
off-chain computations and second layer solutions; however, these solutions
leave a number of fundamental flaws that needlessly complicate wide scale
adoption of blockchain technology for private voting processes.

To register for the voting process, an individual must apply to the certify-
ing authority with their public Dero address and documentation as required.
In this instance, the authority in charge will validate your wallet and allow
for one (1) vote or more as defined by the smart contract. The details of such
a contract should theoretically be public, transparent, and fully available in
any democratic process.

A smart contract of this nature will, of course, require flexibility, and the
ability to be reprogrammed to suit the needs of any party that chooses to
utilize a private smart voting contract. To that end, the Dero development
team is working to keep as much flexibility in the system as possible.

2.3 Asset management: PRIVATE AND AUDITABLE

With Dero, assets can be recorded, distributed, or traded on the blockchain.
Perhaps the most critical issue today facing asset management on the blockchain
is privacy. Consider for a moment how assets are recorded today. Most as-
sets are recorded in a private or centralized database like you may find at
the Department of Motor Vehicles. Organizations or departments often have
limited hours, cumbersome access to information policies, and substantial
overhead costs. Bringing asset management to DERO blockchain will al-
low individuals unrestricted use of their own data, by allowing 24/7 access to
anything they have stored on DERO blockchain while simultaneously offering
unparalleled privacy.

Any individual or organization that choose DERO blockchain for asset
management will benefit from the highest levels of privacy by utilizing the
CryptoNote protocol and complete SSL implementation across the entire net-
work, among other critical features. For audits or tax purposes, all you have
to do is provide a simple and convenient viewkey that will list all relevant
history from the wallet. This view key can be easily programmed into tax
software to reduce cost and human error, while insuring accuracy. Its impor-
tant to note that all details of wallets are entirely hidden from the rest of the
network. As such, it is the individual wallet holders responsibility to make
their relevant tax information known as required.

2.4 2-Factor authentication: Secure password manage-
ment and access

Dero plans to integrate one-time password (OTP) authenticators and passphrases.
Subaddresses could be used as the username to keep public address informa-
tion private, and, if required, an OTP will appear in the wallet. An applica-
tion programming interface (API) and software development kits (SDK) will

be freely distributed to service providers for facilitate integration of their ex-
isting infrastructure with the Dero blockchain. This will create a significantly
more secure environment for the users on a particular service or platform.

2.5 Integration with telecom gateways

DERO blockchain is built in such a way as to allow integration with telecom-
munication gateways, to send and receive short message service (SMS a.k.a.
text) messages. Once your wallet is certified with a telecom operator, you
will be able to send text messages that take advantage of the privacy features
from the CryptoNote protocol. For example, ring CT signatures are just one
of many features used to hide your data. One-time password verified SMS
data will be relayed to the appropriate wallet and held completely privately
for only the recipient.

3 DERO KEY FEATURES

3.1 CryptoNote privacy

CryptoNote currencies use a distributed public ledger that records all bal-
ances and transactions of its in-built currency like Bitcoin. Unlike Bitcoin,
CryptoNotes transactions cannot be followed through the blockchain in a
way that reveals who sent or received coins. Dero utilizes all aspects of the
CryptoNote protocols privacy features in its new blockchain technology to
protect the identities of all parties involved in a transaction.

3.2 Completely SSL/TLS encrypted network

DERO is the first blockchain to have complete SSL in the P2P layer.

The Dero development team has implemented complete TLS across the
Dero network which is a first on any blockchain. This encrypts the entirety
of our network traffic, which greatly reduces our attack surface, while si-
multaneously preventing ISPs or other users from analyzing DERO network
traffic.

3.3 Scalability and security

DERO is the first CryptoNote blockchain to have 75 transactions per second
on its native blockchain without any lightning networks, validators or off-
blockchain solutions.

Currently(October 2, 2018),DERO achieved 12 seconds blocktime and
2 minutes confirmation time by using Dero DAG technology introduced in
Dero Atlantis mainnet:

DERO-DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) DERO Atlantis is DERO-DAG
ased. DERO-DAG is mineable, POW based, fully linear with same level of
security as blockchain.No orphans, scalability limits defined by resources(Compute,
Network, Storage etc.)

DERO DAG implementation builds outs a main chain from the DAG
network of blocks which refers to main blocks (100% reward) and side blocks

8% rewards). Side blocks contribute to chain PoW security and traditional

51% attacks are not possible on DERO network. If DERO network finds
more blocks at the same height, instead of choosing one, DERO include all
locks. Thus, rendering the 51% attack futile.

Traditional Blockchains process blocks as single unit of computa-
tion(if a double-spend tx occurs within the block, entire block is rejected).
However DERO network accepts such blocks since DERO blockchain con-
siders transaction as a single unit of computation.DERO blocks may
contain duplicate or double-spend transactions which are filtered by client

6
protocol and ignored by the network. DERO DAG processes transactions
atomically one transaction at a time.

Client Protocol It handles same transactions mined by two different min-
ers in different blocks mostly due to luck/Network lag.

Optimized Bulletproofs Secure and fast crypto is the basic necessity of
this project and adequate amount of time has been devoted to develop/s-
tudy/implement/audit it. Most of the crypto such as ring signatures have
been studied by various researchers and are in production by number of
projects. As far as the Bulletproofs are considered, since DERO is the first
one to implement /deploy, they have been given a more detailed look.

First, a bare bones bulletproofs was implemented, then implementations
in development were studied (Benedict Bunz,XMR, Dalek Bulletproofs) and
thus improving our own implementation.Some new improvements were dis-
covered and implemented (There are number of other improvements which
are not explained here).
Major improvements are in the Double-Base Double-Scalar Multiplica-
tion while validating bulletproofs. A typical bulletproof takes 15-17 ms to
verify. Optimized bulletproofs takes 1 to 2 ms(simple bulletproof, no ag-
gregate/batching). Since, in the case of bulletproofs the bases are fixed, we
can use precomputed table to convert 64*2 Base Scalar multiplication into
doublings and additions '. This time can be again easily decreased to .5 ms
with some more optimizations.
With batching and aggregation, 5000 range-proofs ( 2500 TX) can be
easily verified on even a laptop. The implementation for bulletproofs is in
https://github.com/deroproject/derosuite/crypto/ringct/bulletproof.
go , optimized version is in https: //github.com/deroproject/derosuite/
crypto/ringct/bulletproof_ultrafast.go.

There are other optimizations such as base-scalar multiplication could
be done in less than a microsecond.Some of these optimizations are not yet
deployed and may be deployed at a later stage.

Further research/studies/optimizations are in-progress to further improve
DERO network.

Ultra Compact Blocks Faster block propagation times and low network
usage.

3.4 Smart contracts

A smart contract is a digital self-executing contract that is capable of enfore-
ing the terms laid out by all participants in the contract. The goal of smart
contracts is to significantly increase contract security while simultaneously
reducing costs associated with traditional contracts.

3.5 Atomic swaps

Atomic swaps make the exchange of one cryptocurrency for another possible
without the need for a trusted third-party. To prevent one party from failing
to send their coins, atomic swaps use something called hash time-locked
contracts (HTLCs)? to enable a trustless trading system.

3.6 Mobile and offline wallets

As with any currency, multiple forms of storage and varying degrees of finan-
cial availability are required. Dero is bringing a complete spectrum of wallet
storage options to users by providing solutions that range from mobile wal-
lets on mobile devices to offline 2FA (Two Factor Authentication) biometric
identification protected hardware wallets.

3.7 Lightweight wallet

Instead of downloading the entire blockchain, a lightweight wallet connects
to randomly selected decentralized nodes to utilize the data stored there.
This dramatically reduces the amount of data required to transact on the
network while maintaining the security of your private keys on your device,
not the node the device is connected to.

3.8 Subaddresses

This technology allows for the creation of additional public addresses for one
wallet. This allows a user to differentiate where payments are coming from

2https://en. bitcoin.it /wiki/Hashed_Timelock_Contracts
while preventing privacy loss caused by linking transactions to one public
address.

3.9 Escrow services on the blockchain

Escrow services may take advantage of DERO blockchain technology by using
it as the trusted third party. In this instance, a financial instrument or an
asset is recorded on the blockchain and held until the appropriate instructions
are given, or contractual obligations have been fulfilled.

3.10 Address signing and certifying

Comparable to the way a certifying authority may issue a passport or drivers
license, an individual may receive digital signatures and pre-authorizations
that are stored on their individual wallet on the blockchain.

3.11 Voting

Through the use of blockchain technology any group or organization may
create a safe and transparent voting system that also maintains complete
anonymity among voters.

4 DERO VIRTUAL MACHINE

Smart Contracts on the DERO blockchain will run in a DERO Virtual Ma-
chine (DVM). DVM is a Turing complete 256-bit Virtual Machine runtime
environment for DERO Smart Contracts with CryptoNote Protocol Privacy
and additional modifications. DVM is unique in its ability to execute Smart
Contracts while maintaining the privacy and fungiblity of the identities in-
volved in the Smart Contracts. DVM will support the Golang language for
writing Smart Contracts with the possibility of Solidity in the future. DVM
is in the development phase, and several other features and optimizations are
planned which may be added in the future.

Chapter 1: Introduction

Social Media platforms have bloomed dramatically ever since their introduction,
especially Facebook. The number has risen as high as 68 million members in
Vietnam(data in March 2020). The reason for usage is expanding from personal use to

fanbase use to business use or introducing a product/service to the market.

This leads to our creation of Like2Like, a platform capturing the abilities and
possibilities that Social Media brings and delivers it in a secured, easy to use, work, or

put into functions.

Like2Like has its ecosystem (found on page 6), which opens platforms from all sources.

better understanding the power of viral activities and leverage the resources of social
media. Like2Like gives opportunities to the owners of social platforms to keep their

users loyal. It can lead to social connection and develop social interactions.

During the pandemic, the pandemic resulted in quota of unemployment going up
unexpectedly throughout the whole world. Moreover, the economic crisis was also
taking a crucial part in the unemployment rate. On the other hand, starvation,
poverty, homeless are still existing. All the above proportions increased on their scale

because of the problem that appeared in the world.

Like2like is here for that purpose:

Our mission is to provide 100 million jobs for the unemployed. Our mission followed

social media interaction services in 3 years.

Like Token

We launched our Like Token on February 21, 2021. It is a memorable event for our
company on a small scale and the Bitcoin world from an expanded and broader
perspective. Our strong advantages are accelerating the transaction within the
platform payment method, secure, fast and free of charge. The number for our
development is astonishing ever since our launch for every part of the ecosystem.

It is a crypto utility token used for rewarding, transaction, gift and was made based on

CSE3.0.

Chapter 2: Technology Enable

We have businesses that support our Like Token, whichLike2Like delivers a platform
based on Blockchain technology to the user obtaining maximum security. Like2Like is
equipped with CSE30 Blockchain Technology 3.0, which was especially targeted for
fast internet connection. Our goal is to become the World’s Leading Technology

Company for both Financial Technology and Digital Transformation.

Our most potent tool is CSE30 Blockchain Technology 3.0, which emphasizes high
security and shorten time usage to analyze customer’s data. The biggest hit from us is
our deliverance of Smart Contract; we owned an enormous, massive amount of Big

Card to increase social network interaction

To create a robust environment and earn money for the community balance, Like2Like
(like2like.org) implements programs for the users who want to increase the amount of
interaction for their social network, community, or help their friends and relatives the

same purpose through the top-up cards. Thereby, the interactive recharge card will

become an effective tool, an important piece to help build and create added value for

Like Token.

There are three types of top-up card values: 200.000 VND, 500.000 VND and

1.000.000 VND

Card to increase social network interaction

Firstly, in addition to the OPP value that will be returned for each type of recharge card
value (as shown in Figure 3), the depositor will also be rewarded with the
corresponding amount of UPP, 30% - 40% - 50% respectively, with a recharge card
200,000 VND — 500,000 VND — 1,000,000 VND. For instance, the Like Token price
updated on May 1, 2021, is 0.092530 USDT (Tether), USD/VND exchange rate is
23,140; conversion rate between Like Token and OPP is 11.75. Table 1 presents the
conversion value between Like Token, USDT, VND, and OPP, respectively, updated on

Third, if you only use UPP to create jobs and keep the same OPP, this amount of OPP
has a variable value between Like Tokens, USDT, and digital currencies on CS9 virtual
exchange. (Crypto security 9). With the benefits that Like2Like brings to the community
and the total value that Like Token's ecosystem provides to all users, the value of Like
Token will increase, then the amount of OPP will have an investment meaning which is
significant for users (or investors). Table 4 can show the interaction with each job (job)

Like Fit

The Like Fit project (LF —- mobile application) aims to create a community with the spirit
of proactive health promotion through the process of walking. The app is officially
released on June 20, 2021.

Like Fit is a tool and an environment for increasing our interactions with our current
and future shareholders. We plan to expand our platform to up to 10.000 active users.
Like Fit was created to be a community and playground for increasing health actively
from health-related activities. We aim to reach 100.000 users within 24 months. Our
motto has good health is like having lots of money. We raise motivation by paying for
the steps the users take or any of their physical activity. Like Fit stays close with the
training process and creates good exercising habits. It helps spread the message of
increasing health by sharing apps with everyone. Exercising is based on motivation, and
we firmly believe that letting the users connect with new friends with the same
purpose will push them to pursue their goals. It is beneficial because the leaders can
create plans for the members daily; they can practice anywhere. The tracker tracks
every exercise you perform, and we pay for you to work out and pays higher than most
apps. The process of getting your money is also fast and accessible by the crypto floor.
Players in the Like Token ecosystem earn Like Fit (LF). Players make LF through mining

and can spend this money on better tools in the NFT Marketplace.

Staking

It is introduced officially on June 20,2021.

Staking is known as the act of buying and storing cryptocurrency in cryptocurrency
wallets

Proof of Staking — PoS

PoS is an algorithm created to add new blocks of data to the blockchain platform.
Those holding or owning a certain amount of cryptocurrency will stake these blocks,
and PoS will validate a new transaction or agreement on the blockchain system. Users
can mine or confirm new transactions for cryptocurrencies with a value corresponding
to the amount of cryptocurrency used in those transactions. The more cryptocurrency
you put in, the more likely the transactions will be valid and vice versa. And
accordingly, the interest is generated more and more, and you will get more
cryptocurrencies. In this method, the system will use smart contracts (Smart Contracts)
and agree to authorize and limit the specific amount of Staking for a Staking stage (also

known as Staking Nodes). These steps will always work online on the system.

Like Token Capacity Profile 26
(A) Like2 Like | Business Ecosystem

Chapter 4: Business Ecosystem

Staking

The Staking tiers mentioned above need to be authorized to store and provide a place
to contribute cryptocurrency if they want to stay connected in the blockchain system.
They confirm that the owner of these steps is a system member through the amount of
money they are Staking. Those Staking Nodes also support users in adding new blocks
and receiving rewards, commissions in cryptocurrencies, coins, etc.

Staking will create for the blockchain platform the infrastructure and financial
resources to maintain the reliability of these staking tiers.

As such, Staking is a suitable method for you to invest in the field of cryptocurrency.
And the essential factor in helping you profit from Staking is patience.

Staking is an intelligent investment solution to increase income and assets quickly and
easily:

- Increasing the number of Crypto assets through global partners and the CSE
community;

- Increase passive income through effective and convenient tools;

- More effective portfolio risk management with Blockchain technology ver 3.0 — Smart

Contracts;
Users do not have to spend a lot of time with Like Staking because automation tools are processed by Al

technology (Artificial Intelligent - Artificial Intelligence).

Farming

It is published officially on May 24, 2021.

A popular way to start a decentralized blockchain is to distribute governance tokens
algorithmically, with liquidity incentives. This attracts liquidity providers to “mine” new
tokens by providing liquidity to the protocol. Yield farming is also known as liquidity
mining, which generates rewards from holding crypto assets. In a word, it means
locking the cryptocurrency and getting the compensation. In a sense, yield farming can
be done in parallel with staking. It works with users known as liquidity providers (LPs)
to add funds to liquidity pools. Yield farmers will often move their funds quite a bit
between different protocols in search of high returns. As a result, Like2Like can also
provide another economic incentive to attract more capital to the platform. Just like on
centralized exchanges, liquidity tends to attract more liquidity. Liquidity providers
deposit funds into the liquidity pool. This pool powers the marketplace where users
can lend, borrow, or trade tokens. The process of using the platforms incurs a fee,
which is then paid to the liquidity providers according to their market share in the
liquidity pool. What is a liquidity pool? It is a smart contract that contains money.
When you provide liquidity to the bank, you will receive tokens and rewards. The
rewards may come only from fees generated by our platform. Those reward tokens can

then be deposited into other liquidity pools to earn more rewards.

Application: Like Miner

Like Mining is an application to mine tokens such as (Bitcoin BTC, Ethereum ETH,
Binance Coin BNB, Dogecoin DOGE, SHIBA INU, and tokens in the CSE ecosystem)
developed by the Like2Like team.

The new projects utilized the potential of the smartphone’s hardware resources to dig
for Like Tokens created by Like2Like. The test version of the app was introduced on May
21, 2020, with the upcoming day on May xx, 2021, for its computer version of the Linux
and Windows operating systems with completely similar features to the web app
version. The users can generate profits by duplicating their Like Token and exchange it
on the cs9.io exchange floor. The process information of the excavator is transparent
with our CSE30 technology and credited on the cs9.io exchange floor. We plan to carry
on and put this project to work at its most potent quality before the end of 2021.

Users in the process of mining Like Token will receive all the information and reports of
mining efficiency such as Level (Power-up); Power (Power-up); Total reps; Total reps
loaded; Tokens mined (Like); Miner speed; Device information like the chip, 32/64-bit,

Like2Like deploys a top-up card system based on dealer levels to create business
opportunities and find jobs for users.

In this section, we will narrow down the calculations to the following:

The term top-up card: It is calculated based on the minimum recharge card value of
200.000 VND; Total number of top-up cards to be issued: 10.000; Estimated
implementation time: 30 days.

The dealer hierarchy and the respective sales (card quantity) and discount and profit
levels are presented in Table 5.

Agents with start sales from 2.000.000.000 VND will receive a discount of up to 45.0%.
And if the minimum sales level at Level N - 20.000.000 VND is not met, then the agent

is only entitled to a minimum discount of 15.0%

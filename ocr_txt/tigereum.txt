Welcome to Tigereum
Overview

Over the next two years, everyone will be sending money
by instant message. Social media companies are working
around the clock on this paradigm shift. Crypto is being left
behind on these smaller social payments. Sending crypto
from digital wallets is difficult for small amounts. Enter the
Tiger. Tigereum will enable everyone to securely and easily
send small amounts of crypto to friends and family by
instant message.

The Problem

A revolution is occurring in the way we send money.
Social media giants like Facebook, WhatsApp and Skype
are investing in solutions to send money by instant
message. Crypto should be at the forefront of this new
wave but instead it is lagging behind. Digital wallets will
not be able to compete with instant messaging for smaller
money transfers.

The Solution
Tigereum will develop an Al chatbot to enable the crypto

community to securely and easily send small amounts of
crypto to friends and family by instant message.

A?

Tigereum will adopt the key principles of the crypto world:
security, anonymity, decentralization and encryption.

Building our solution around Al chatbots makes Tigereum
flexible, globally scalable, independent of any particular
instant messaging platform, and quick to market.

Messaging with Crypto

Crypto developers should be able to provide a better solution
for messaging money than social media companies, big banks
and international remitters.

Crypto already has the answers to a decentralized, borderless,
secure, digital, global currency which can be messaged to
anyone, anywhere. Crypto’s competitive advantages should
make messaging money cheaper and easier for everyone. The
crypto community should be at the forefront of this paradigm
shift, and not leave it to the instant messaging platforms.

Tigereum’s initial aim is more humble: to enable the crypto
community to message crypto on instant messaging
platforms, in the same way that fiat currencies are messaged.

We can take on bigger challenges once we achieve this.

A?

Tigereum’s Al Chatbot

Tigereum will not only enable crypto to be messaged, it will
also provide the crypto community with the best customer
experience for sending crypto. Tigereum will deliver
conversation-style messaging of crypto using the newest Al
tools available for chatbots.

Tigereum won't ask you to clunk through your digital wallet to
send crypto or fill out web forms, or take QR scans or paste long
crypto addresses.

Tigereum’s Al chatbot solution will enable crypto holders to
securely message crypto:

* anonymously, or with disclosed identities

* onany device - mobile, tablet, laptop or desktop - on the go,
in the office, at home, in an airport lounge, or on the beach

* within the instant message platforms you use to
communicate with your friends

+ without passwords, usernames, QR scans, new software or
new apps

- fully secured by encrypted identity tokens

+ using any cryptocurrency

* across borders

+ inyour preferred language.

How the Al Chatbot Will Work

Tigereum’s Al chatbot solution will be simple to use, and users
will complete the following steps:

- Add Tigereum to your friends list on any
instant messaging platform you like to use.

+ Open a chat with Tigereum to message crypto to a friend.
* Tigereum will ask three simple questions in chat style:

(1) which cryptocurrency do you want to send?

(2) how much?

(3) do you want to write a short message to your friend?

+ Choose a friend (the recipient of your crypto) from your
friends or contacts list on your device.

+ Details of your transfer will be displayed on screen and can be
messaged to your friend.

- Pay for the crypto you have messaged using your digital wallet.

« Your friend can use the crypto in whatever way they like:
+ depositing it in their digital wallet

- exchanging it for fiat and depositing it

in their bank account

+ forwarding it to another friend.

Tigereum Prototype

Tigereum has built a prototype Al chatbot for securely sending
money on the Facebook Messenger instant messaging
platform, and has performed a series of early tests. These

have helped identify the chatbot's scalability and garnered
important customer feedback. Tigereum is ready to commence
a full live pilot and to integrate crypto into the chatbot.

Industry Background

Cryptocurrencies

Readers of this Whitepaper are familiar with the background of
cryptocurrencies. A summary is provided here:

+ Cryptocurrencies are decentralized digital currencies which
operate outside normal central banking.

+ Bitcoin was the first major cryptocurrency, commencing in
2009 after a paper was released under the name Satoshi
Nakamoto. There are close to 17 million Bitcoins mined, trading
around US$4000 each with a capitalization of US$68 billion.
Bitcoin value has doubled over the last 12 months alone.

+ Other major cryptocurrencies are Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin
and DASH which make up part of over 700 cryptocurrencies
worldwide with a total value of roughly US$150 billion.

+ To trade between cryptocurrencies, and in/out of fiat, crypto
exchanges have become important service providers to the
crypto community. There are about 200 crypto exchanges.
Approximately US$300,000,000 is traded on crypto exchanges
each day.

Crypto holders keep their cryptocurrency assets in digital wallets.
Digital wallets are like online bank portals. You can see which
cryptocurrencies you own, and their current value. You can buy
more crypto into your wallet, or sell it (through an exchange).

tt:
faa
=

Digital wallets enable customers to send and receive crypto
directly to and from other crypto holders. In your digital wallet,
you have an anonymous, encrypted, randomly-generated
address for your cryptocurrency. This is like a bank account
number (but it’s so long you have no hope of remembering it).
You can send crypto to a friend at their address from within
your digital wallet.

You can only send and receive crypto to and from your digital
wallet if you and your friend have crypto. If you want to send
funds to a friend who does not have crypto, you have to

first convert your crypto to fiat, then transfer it to your bank
account, and finally send fiat to your friend from your bank
account through an international remitter, or indeed by instant
message.

Generally, there is a 2% charge to send and receive crypto
between digital wallets.

Online Landscape

Facebook, Google, Alibaba, Tencent, Apple and Microsoft know
that many customers would prefer to use instant messaging to
message money to friends and family, especially for smaller
social-type payments, so this is what customers will get.

Facebook introduced messaging small amounts of money for
US customers in 2015 on Messenger. This is a brilliant customer
interface, as it is very easy to use. However, Facebook has
struggled to overcome the international regulatory obstacles
to roll this out globally. It has also apparently been working on
a patent to protect its unique IP solution for messaging money
In the meantime, Facebook's dual strategy is to work with
remittance partners outside the US and support
payment chatbots on its Messenger platform.

tt:
faa
=

WeChat introduced instant messaging of money to customers
in China in 2016. The owners of WeChat recently bought
MoneyGram, so expect to see this feature expand rapidly for its
Chinese customers.

Snapchat introduced instant messaging of money to its platform
in 2014, by partnering with Square.

WhatsApp announced in 2016 that it plans to enable instant
messaging of international currencies. WhatsApp is preferred by
international users, therefore the opportunities for WhatsApp

are as big as the regulatory obstacles and currency exchange
challenges. It could unwittingly be running an international
remittance operation within an instant messaging platform, and
earning significant revenue from currency exchange. It seems this
strategy is still under consideration.

Hike (in India) announced in August 2017 that it would introduce
payments to its instant messaging platform.

Paypal has been successfully messaging money to emails and
mobile phone numbers for over ten years.

Venmo (a Paypal brand) messages money in the US and Singapore
through an instant messaging app.

Sending money using instant messaging is changing the way we
use the internet, and how we communicate. Online experiences

which require us to download desktop software, go to a browser,
send an SMS, install a mobile app, or even make a phone call, are
in decline. Instant messaging money is the next big thing.
a

Instant messaging is even outstripping the new social media
tools which put Facebook, Google and Amazon on the map ten
years ago. Instant messaging is becoming more popular than
the generation of social media apps we all first came to use, and
this change is occurring right now. The social media companies
are having to re-invent themselves already.

Because of these trends, and the possibility of skimming a
large number of small fees across global banking transactions
(a market worth over US$400 trillion per year in international
remittances alone) it is easy to see why social media companies
are working on how to make payments work on their instant
messaging platforms.

International Remitters

International remitters (of fiat currencies) are very relevant to
this market analysis, and Tigereum.

The key international remitters are Western Union, MoneyGram,
and Transferwise. Paypal is not regarded as a traditional
international remitter, but it rates a mention here too.

Primary customer-facing tools for international remitters are
local branches and agents dispensing cash. Western Union
has over 500,000 branches and agents around the world.
Where they do employ technology they are, in the main, still
using only web browsers, SMS and mobile apps, which are
clunky to use. International remitters are expensive, and part
of the centralized financial ecosystem which represents fiat
currencies, central banking and burdensome regulations.

tt:
faa
=

Western Union is not particularly inventive or challenging,
and we all know it well. It is the dinosaur in the park.

MoneyGram was recently acquired by Chinese financial
conglomerate Tencent (which also owns WeChat). Expect changes.

Transferwise is being a successful disrupter. In only ten years,
Transferwise has grown to remitting $1 billion per month.
It recently released a remittance chatbot.

Paypal is doing great work. It has a strong customer interface and
is breaking all the rules (in a good way) to better serve customers’
financial requirements smoothly and efficiently.

Start-up fintechs like Revolut in the UK are also doing interesting
work in this market.

Ripple is a cryptocurrency which is developing some great tools
for international remittances. Its focus seems to be at the top of
the B2B end of the market — to facilitate efficient movement of
large amounts of international currencies between banks and
global corporations. This is very important work for the crypto
community, however, it is unlikely that Ripple will deliver B2C
solutions for sending and receiving crypto to friends and family.

None of these fiat international remitters show any signs of

using digital currencies to revolutionize themselves and create
efficiencies. None of them seem to be adopting crypto as the way
forward in a decentralized, anonymous, encrypted world which
treats currencies as jurisdictionally-bound anachronisms. They are
all very much creatures of their highly-regulated environments
and legacy customer interfaces. Even Paypal is starting to look
legacy now.

3

In fact, rather than develop their own solutions for messaging
international remittances, it looks like their preferred strategy
is to partner up with the social media companies to deliver the
systems, compliance and back-end banking for messaging

money on instant messaging platforms.

Digital Wallet vs Instant Messaging

The crypto community has built an impressive ecosystem over
the last ten years, and it is indeed possible to send crypto from
a digital wallet. However, typical digital wallets are hard work
for most people and are expensive to use. They are not the
preferred way to send and receive money between friends and
family. It is difficult to use your digital wallet to simply send
small amounts of crypto. It’s usually easier to send money from
an online bank portal.

The problem is that digital wallets have customer interfaces
based on old forms. Crypto has leapt ahead as a new form of
digital currency, but digital wallets have not kept up with new
forms of customer communication and they have not linked up
with the social media tools we use everyday. Digital wallets may
be good for holding and trading cryptocurrencies, but not for
sending funds to friends and family.

Customers will continue to message fiat as their default choice
on their preferred instant messaging platform before they send
crypto from a digital wallet everyday.

Competitor Analysis
Tigereum is not proposing to be any of these things:

+ Crypto wallet

+ Crypto exchange
- Remittance

+ Bank

+ Social media

+ Billing platform

+ Foreign exchange
+ Payment card

Tigereum will be a blockchain, anonymous, encrypted and secure

instant messaging Al chatbot to send crypto to friends and family.

Who is competing with Tigereum in the crypto community? We
have not identified any direct competitors. Nobody seems to be
doing what Tigereum is proposing.

We have identified a number of indirect competitors to Tigereum
in the crypto community whose mission is to provide good
customer interface to crypto holders, and help them use their
crypto in a predominantly fiat world.

They are not digital wallets (exclusively) but are building website
and app solutions which are friendlier and easier to use than

the average digital wallet, and which generally also enable their
customers to send crypto to friends and family in a fiat world.

a

Wirex (www.wirex.com) is a Bitcoin wallet website and app with
a plastic and digital prepaid MasterCard attached. Customers
can move funds within the Wirex wallet between Bitcoin and
fiat, and spend their fiat online and instore with the MasterCard.
It also enables send/receive between other Wirex account
holders, and easier links to your fiat bank account(s).

Cryptopay (www.cryptopay.me) also offers a plastic and digital
prepaid MasterCard so that customers can spend their Bitcoin
in fiat currencies online and in-store, and to send crypto to
other Cryptopay account holders.

Izibits (www.izibits.io) is interesting to Tigereum because its
whole architecture is built as an Al chatbot. It is not a website
or app. It is a website/app chatbot. All interactions with their
customers occur within a chat. It is developing a new suite of
services, including: P2P transfers, international remittances,

a prepaid MasterCard, a shopping platform, and a crypto
exchange.

Bitpay (www.bitpay.com) is a US-based payment gateway for
crypto/fiat. It seems to be pitched mainly to merchants who
want to accept crypto payments. Bitpay enables merchants
and retails customers to send crypto and fiat in their shopping
ecosystems.

Byteball (www.byteball.org) is one of the few new blockchain
offerings we could find which allows you to chat and pay in an
instant message, as one of the many things it does.

However, none of these crypto companies are doing what
Tigereum is proposing.

Disruption

Messaging money on instant messaging platforms is going to be a
game changer. It will disrupt many markets:

- Banks (domestic and international transfers)
+ Remitters (Western Union, MoneyGram, Transferwise)
+ Payment apps (Venmo, Paypal, PayTM, Revolut)

Crypto should not be left behind as this change sweeps through
our financial institutions or the customer experience gap between
crypto and fiat will widen further.

In fact, crypto should be leading this disruption. Crypto's
decentralized blockchain architecture should be taking this battle
on, not leaving it to the social media companies.

First Mover Advantage

Tigereum has a significant first mover advantage. We are well
positioned to ride the instant messaging wave for the crypto
community if we can start our development work and go-to-
market strategies now.

Our primary aim is to provide a viable alternative in the market
for crypto holders to message crypto to their friends and family,
so that they do not have to convert to fiat simply to message
funds easily and efficiently.

Our secondary aim is to build on all the benefits of crypto to
make messaging crypto a better and more secure solution for
messaging funds, especially across international borders.

Tigereum Tokens

Cryptocurrency for Instant Messages

tt:
faa
=

Tigereum Tokens will be the cryptocurrency used to send
crypto to friends and family in an instant message. Senders

will buy Tigereum Tokens to message money. Recipients will
redeem Tigereum Tokens into their preferred crypto or fiat
currency to receive their money. The mechanisms for this to
occur securely and efficiently will be developed further through

the course of this project.

Initial Tokens

There will be fifty million (50,000,000) Tigereum Tokens created.
Up to forty million (40,000,000) of these will be swapped for
ETH under the Token Swap program described further in this

Whitepaper.

Listing of Tigereum Tokens

Tigereum Tokens will be listed on public cryptocurrency
exchanges, starting with EtherDelta. This listing is scheduled for
Monday 18 December 2017 (the close date for the Token Swap).

Tigereum Tokens will be listed on other exchanges promptly
after Monday 18 December 2017 to maximise trading

opportunities for Tigereum Token holders.

Revenue Model

Tigereum will earn revenue from payments flowing through
our platform. This revenue stream will underpin the

value of Tigereum Tokens.

A?

It is common for crypto exchanges to charge 1% to 2% for
transfers, and for international remitters to charge fees (including
exchange margins) up to 5% for fiat remittances. Based on these
competitor price points, Tigereum expects revenues through its
Al chatbot to attract gross margins in the range of 2% to 5%.

Value Proposition

Tigereum’'s high-margin revenues will create an environment in
which upward price pressure can benefit Token Swap participants,
and ensure a strong secondary market into the long term.

As Tigereum gains traction in the market, more Tigereum Tokens
will be required by our customers to message crypto. This will give
rise to greater liquidity and upward price pressure on the value of
Tigereum Tokens.

The availability (and pricing) of Tigereum Tokens will be
controlled by the secondary market, so Token Swap participants
can be assured that there will be a viable secondary market for
Tigereum Tokens when we go to market.

Messaging Tigereum Tokens

Tigereum will develop the mechanisms to securely message
crypto seamlessly and cost-effectively without compromising
anonymity and the blockchain’s integrity.

We anticipate that these mechanisms may require Tigereum to

hold a treasury float to manage the exchange between crypto and
fiat currencies. This treasury float, if required, will not be created
until Tigereum is ready to go to market as it is not required
during the development phase, and we need to get the
model right first.

d
tt:
faa
=

Intellectual Property

Tigereum may apply for patents for methods we develop within
our Al chatbots for messaging crypto. Patents will further
underpin the value of Tigereum Tokens and reduce the risk of
unfair competition.

This will be considered after our key development work has
finished, but before we go to market.

Regulation

Until Tigereum has completed its development, it is not
possible to have clarity about what regulations may apply

to Tigereum Tokens. Tigereum will obtain legal advice on
regulatory compliance before launching any Al chatbots using
Tigereum Tokens in the market.

Notwithstanding this uncertainty, at this stage we recognize
there are four key areas of regulation to consider regardless
of which laws may apply: consumer protection, prevention of
money laundering, taxation and remittances.

« Inall countries, regulators with responsibility for ensuring
that financial services are provided in a way that protects
consumers and maintains the integrity of the market will be
interested in Tigereum Tokens.

+ Local tax laws are complex, and will apply on a case by case
basis, depending on where Tigereum Tokens are issued.

+ The prevention of money laundering is taken very seriously
in many countries around the world. Tigereum will at
all times act to prevent money laundering.

A?

+ tis not clear whether messaging Tigereum Tokens would
constitute a remittance, and whether Tigereum would have
to comply with the regulatory requirements which various

countries impose on international remitters.

Insurance

All Tigereum Tokens will be fully insured and kept in cold storage.
This means that if Tigereum were to suffer a breach of its online
storage, the insurance policy would pay to cover any funds lost as
a result.

The insurance policy covers any losses resulting from a breach of
Tigereum’s physical security, cyber security, or by employee theft.
The policy is planned to be provided by a syndicate of insurers
through Lloyd's of London (which also insures, for example, Airbnb
&Tokenbase).

This will also apply to other digital currency that Tigereum will
hold, such as ETH which it will receive under the Token Swap.

Token Swap
Introduction

Tigereum will make forty million (40,000,000) Tigereum Tokens
available to swap for ETH.

Key Dates

The Token Swap opens at 09:00 GMT on Friday 8 December
2017 and closes at 23:00 GMT on Monday 18 December 2017.

Token Swap Price

The Token Swap Price is 1 ETH for 1000 Tigereum Tokens.

First Day Bonus

When the Token Swap opens on Friday 8 December 2017 there
will be a 33% bonus. Your 1 ETH can be swapped for 1,333
Tigereum Tokens (giving you 333 bonus Tigereum Tokens).

This 33% bonus applies only from 09:00 GMT to 23:00 GMT on
the first day - Friday 8 December.

Public Exchanges

On Monday 18 December 2017, Tigereum Tokens will be listed
on EtherDelta. We will list promptly on other public exchanges
such as Coss.io after this initial listing.

A?

Pre-Swaps

Pre-Swaps are available until Monday 20 November 2017.
We will offer special bonuses to Pre-Swap Participants.
Contact us for your Pre-Swap special bonus.

The objective of Pre-Swaps is to fund this Token Swap campaign
and further develop the Tigereum prototype.

Pre-Swap Participants will be rewarded with the following
additional benefits:

+ Personal invitation to participate in testing
« VIP invitation to product launch

+ Bonuses for early participation

+ Priority access to the first buyback

Benefits of Token Swap

We have structured the Token Swap to minimise risks and
maximise returns for participants:

+ Prototype already in testing

+ Experienced team of entrepreneurs

+ Low, hard cap on the number of tokens

+ Optional buyback & burn program

* Tokens an integral part of the business model

tt:
faa
=

Allocation
Tigereum Tokens will be allocated as follows:

* 80% to Token Swap participants, including Pre-Swap and
bonuses

+ 20% to be split between bounty (1%), team members and
advisors (2%) and founders (17%).

In the unlikely event that not all of the Tokens allocated for the
Token Swap are swapped, they will be burned.

ERC-20 Standard

Ethereum smart contracts enable a very transparent and secure
way of profit sharing among Tigereum Token holders. Tigereum
Tokens will be an Ethereum-based token of value.

Ethereum-based tokens are a digital asset, bearing value by
themselves based on their underlying assets and associated
rights. They rely on a well-established Ethereum infrastructure,
benefiting from several advantages:

+ Security and predictability (as opposed to, for example,
having to run an independent blockchain network).

+ Use of robust and well-supported clients (Ethereum-based
Tokens can be managed with official Ethereum clients).

* High liquidity (interchangeable with other Ethereum-
based tokens or ETH); easier listing on exchanges with
infrastructure already in place.

Our Ethereum-based Tigereum Token smart contract will
comply with the ERC-20 standard, and it will be extremely
easy for exchange trading to happen.

tt:
faa
=

More detailed information about the ERC-20 standard:
https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20

Use of Token Swap Funds

Overseen by the Advisory Board and financial auditors,
ETH swapped for Tigereum Tokens will be used to fund:

+ the development of Tigereum’s Al chatbot solution,

+ legal and regulatory costs,

* ago-to-market team around the Tigereum solution,

+ marketing to grow the Tigereum business, and

+ working capital for operations as the Tigereum business
establishes itself, and

+ the treasury float of crypto and fiat currencies needed by
Tigereum to enable settlements to occur (subject to the
mechanism to be finally adopted).

BuyBack & Burn

Tigereum will allocate corporate profits to buying back Tigereum
Tokens.

Participation in the buyback program is optional. Tigereum Token
holders who participate will receive their buyback in the form of
ETH swap. Priority will be given to Pre-Swap participants in the
first buyback program. Tigereum expects to burn buyback tokens.

Our buyback & burn program will allow the net asset value of a
Tigereum Token to increase, giving all token holders a fair way to
gain value in their Tigereum Tokens over the long-term.

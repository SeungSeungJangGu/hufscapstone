MANTRAs are typically melodic, mathematically structured meters, believed to be
resonant with numinous qualities.

DAO’s are a paradigm shift in the very idea of economic organizations, offering
complete transparency, total tokenholder control, unprecedented flexibility, and
autonomous governance.

MANTRA DAO leverages the knowledge and wisdom of the crowd to create a
community governed, transparent, and decentralized ecosystem for web 3.0 that gives
financial control back to the people to grow their wealth together.

MANTRA DAO

4
Abstract

MANTRA DAO is a fully integrated ecosystem of decentralized financial services built
on interoperable technologies and controlled by its users collectively. Its governance
mechanism is predicated upon a digital token called OM that allows its holders to
participate in decisions affecting the parameters of the system. OM token is
distributed as a reward for contributions made to the platform and provides access to
a variety of economic incentives. In addition to OM token, MANTRA DAO supports the
Karma Protocol, a reputation mechanism that assesses participants’ behavior within
the system and keeps track of OM holders’ performance metrics.
Introduction

Distributed ledger technology and cryptocurrencies enable faster, more inclusive and
transparent financial services than traditional legacy systems. However, current
blockchain solutions lack interoperability and are laden with governance issues,
preventing DeFi from reaching mass adoption.

The evolution of Blockchain systems design since the inception of Bitcoin in 2009 has
been driven by this critical need for adaptability and connectivity. Over the past few
years, various initiatives have aimed at addressing the limitations of traditional
blockchains by adopting flexible design and providing interoperability between networks.

Polkadot is a sharded protocol that enables multiple blockchain networks to operate
together seamlessly, increasing the resulting network’s throughput by parallelizing
transactions and transfers of data.

It surmounts the limitations of general-purpose blockchains in terms of scalability by
providing a composability framework for those blockchains to communicate. From this
perspective, Polkadot can be thought of as a superstructure for digital infrastructures
(referred to as parachains) to be built atop.

MANTRA DAO is a decentralized application built on Rio Chain, a Substrate-based
blockchain infrastructure that is interoperable with the Polkadot network.
The MANTRA DAO platform is composed of the following features:

1. A savings and lending platform whereby depositors can earn interests on their
pooled digital assets.

2. A governance token called OM which confers its holders’ voting power over certain
economic parameters such as interest rate, inflation and deflation levels.

3. A reputation protocol called KARMA which A) weighs the voting power of OM
token holders proportionally to certain measurable metrics. B) increases the
chances of OM token holders benefiting from various financial incentive schemes.

MANTRA DAO is a project initiated by the MANTRA DAO Foundation, a validator
candidate on the Polkadot Network. MANTRA DAO Foundation is created to maintain
the MANTRA DAO platform and serve the OM token holders, who are the beneficiaries
of the foundation and govern how it operates.

The MANTRA DAO Foundation will ensure the release and development of the
MANTRA DAO until the MANTRA community is established enough to maintain it in a
completely decentralized manner. The MANTRA DAO Foundation is also responsible
for safeguarding certain intangible assets pertaining to the project such as trademarks
and copyrights.
MANTRA DAO

Community-Governed Organizations

DAOs — Decentralized Autonomous Organizations — are changing how organizations
are coordinating their activities to create value. A DAO is decentralized because
control over its operations does not reside in a single location. It is autonomous
because the smart contracts that govern its operations determine how the
organization functions, without the need for human intervention.

DAOs represent a massive upgrade on the traditional firm. DAOs use blockchain
technology and programmable incentives to solve issues traditionally faced by global
organizations, such as financial transparency, process automation, governance, and
aligning geographically-separated, individual stakeholders in pursuit of a common
goal. By combining state-of-the-art technology with new _ token-economic,
governance, and financial models, DAOs can provide substantial benefits for their
members. With DAOs, communities are able to leverage the strengths of all
members, turning them into active stakeholders to grow the network together.

While DAOs have amazing potential, they’re still very new. Most existing DAOs are
too complicated for the average person to interact with as they require a
sophisticated knowledge of cryptocurrencies. What’s needed to bring DAOs more
into the mainstream? Better user experience, simpler governance & voting
processes, a reputation system that promotes positive actions, and more incentives
for active participation. With these systems in place, each DAO member has both
economic and social incentives to be a nice person, a good collaborator, and a team
player, as well as to hold each other accountable, regardless of age, experience, or
perceived influence.
Staking

MANTRA DAO will support non-custodial staking services beginning with Polkadot
ecosystem assets including but not limited to:

As more Polkadot Ecosystem assets become available for staking, we will add them
accordingly. These include RING, PCX, and ACA.

Continuing our non-custodial staking service, we will add other DPoS assets such as:

- XTZ
- TRX
- ADA
- EOS
- ELA
- Etc.

We plan to support non-custodial staking in the near-to-mid-term but will also add
custodial staking-as-a-service for other PoS assets, such as ETH 2.0 and DASH.

The rules for the staking of assets will vary by the chain and by the asset. However, as
an example, we will not charge staking-as-a-service fees for Polkadot assets in the
beginning, but we will charge a staking fee for other DPoS assets. These fees will be
variable depending on the staked asset and can be voted upon through the OM
governance token.

Example: If a user is staking $1,000 worth of DOT with us and generates a 20% return
on their assets, we will return the principle + 20% or $1,200 in DOT and give them at
least an additional 50% of the USD value of the DOT interest generated in the form of
the OM token. In this case, they would receive $1,300, a 30% return, in USD value on
their underlying principle. Depending on the KARMA level of the individual they could
receive an even higher percentage of OM interest, up to 100% of the USD value of
the DOT interest.
Lending

MANTRA DAO is developing multiple lending products over three phases.

OM

In Phase 1, we'll build cross-chain bridges to existing open-source DeFi lending
protocols, such as Compound, to offer our users access to lending interest for
Ethereum-based assets.

In Phase 2, we’ll be using third-party lending service providers on the back-end to
provide access to high-interest savings options and stablecoin loans. This platform-
agnostic approach allows us to cooperate with industry leaders across multiple
blockchains and protocols, giving users access to a full suite of services within a single,
easy-to-use interface. MANTRA DAO Foundation will take a small spread on these
integrated products.

10
In Phase 3, we’ll be developing our own proprietary lending algorithm & stablecoin
system, similar to MakerDAO’s, but with cross-chain collateralized assets rather than just
Ethereum-based ones. By using tokenized derivatives, such as omDOT, as collateral, we’ll
allow users the opportunity to generate staking rewards even while taking out stablecoin
loans. Users can then utilize this system to leverage their underlying assets, in a way that’s
less risky than traditional margin trading, in order to acquire more of them, generating
further yields.

USDOM Stablecoin

USDOM is the native stablecoin of the MANTRA DAO platform, which will be launched
during Phase 3 of our lending platform development. Similar to MakerDAO’s DAI
stablecoin, USDOM is multi-collateral, generated through Collateralized Debt Positions
(CDPs) in an overcollateralized manner, and pegged 1:1 with the US Dollar.

While DAI can only use ERC-20 assets to back it, USDOM could be backed by any
cryptocurrency that’s supported by the Polkadot network, which will include OM, DOT,
KSM, BTC, ETH and ERC-20 tokens, EOS, ADA, XTZ, etc. The specific assets that are used in
practice will depend on the liquidity of the underlying asset and the selections of
MANTRA DAO’s members via the community governance process.

Derivative Tokens

While many users may choose to stake with MANTRA DAO in a fully non-custodial
manner, there is a downside to staking tokens this way. Polkadot (DOT) tokens will be
locked for 28 days on Polkadot after unbonding, and seven days for Kusama (KSM) tokens.

Derivative tokens, such as omDOT, provide liquidity for NPoS, DPoS, and other staking
cryptocurrencies that would otherwise be bonded, and therefore locked, as part of the
staking process. These derivative tokens still provide users with the ability to participate in
on-chain governance, by signaling their votes on proposals via the MANTRA DAO
platform, and they are redeemable for their underlying assets at any time.

The value of derivative tokens like omDOT grows over time due to the accumulated value
of staking rewards, similar to how Compound’s cTokens increase in value due to the
interest generated by the protocol. These derivative tokens are exchangeable receipts for
the underlying assets, allowing the benefits of liquidity and tradability while still
supporting the security of the underlying DPoS networks through native on-chain staking.

12
MANTRA POOL

MANTRA POOL is a crypto savings game that allows users to participate for the
chance to win a percentage of MANTRA DAO Foundation’s staking rewards. Every
week, the protocol will select randomly generated winners. Users are able to enter
the MANTRA POOL by burning OM to generate an entry.

Users can gain entry into the MANTRA POOL in 2 ways:

- Burning OM, where 1 burnt OM = 1 entry
- Depending on a user’s KARMA level, they will have automatic entries into the
MANTRA POOL

25% of all the staking rewards generated by MANTRA DAO Foundation’s assets will go
to funding MANTRA POOL. This basket of rewards is given out in their native assets,
e.g. DOT, KSM, XTZ, OM, etc. Users will have the option to convert all these assets to
OM with additional earned interest if they so choose.

We also will allow for sponsored MANTRA POOL giveaways, where companies can
sponsor a distribution using assets of their choosing. These will run separately from
the staking reward-generated MANTRA POOL offerings.

MANTRA DAO

13
Governance

In order to submit a proposal and vote within the MANTRA DAO ecosystem, a member
must first hold and stake OM. Each staked OM represents 1 vote within the MANTRA
DAO system. In order to propose a topic for voting, users will need to deposit USD
$100 worth of OM as collateral. If the proposal should fail, they will lose the OM, but if
the proposal passes evaluation from the council, then the vote will proceed. If the
proposal receives a simple majority (51%) of the votes from the valid voters (staking
OM), then the depositor will receive their OM back as well as an additional amount of
KARMA for helping the ecosystem.

The process for voting is as follows:

- 1 week for proposals

- 1 week for evaluation of proposals

- 1 week for the voting of proposals

- 1 week for the implementation of proposals

OM holders who stake OM will be allowed to propose changes to the MANTRA DAO
ecosystem including, but not limited to, changes in:

- Interest rates

- OM Inflation level

- Ecosystem grants

- Adding additional staking assets

- Adding additional lending products
- Etc.

The MANTRA DAO Council is currently comprised of 5 Council Members. The Council
Members will serve 2-year terms and will help guide the proposal, evaluation, voting,
and implementation process for MANTRA DAO. Every two years, there will be a vote for
the next MANTRA DAO Council Members, with the maximum number of Council
Members being set at 9. The Council will always maintain an odd number of councilors
to never allow for a tie during the evaluation of proposals. The maximum number of
consecutive council terms by any Council Member is set at 5.

It is also possible within our governance model that the MANTRA DAO Council can
create sub-councils that specifically focus on certain topics, such as the MANTRA DAO
Financial Council. The overall MANTRA DAO Council holds veto power over any sub-
council.

14
Grants

The MANTRA DAO Foundation’s Member Grant program is designed to directly
support the growth and expansion of the MANTRA DAO ecosystem through projects
that either increase OM token’s adoption and use, open up new markets and
business lines, support economies (both emerging and established), create novel
uses of the MANTRA DAO stablecoin, or ones that generally embrace MANTRA DAO
Foundation’s guiding principles and vision. The program can make grant allocations
between 5K - 100K USD equivalent in either OM tokens or the USDOM stablecoin.
Any grants given out will be distributed on a milestone basis as the teams reach
different pre-determined KPls. As with anything in the MANTRA DAO ecosystem,
should the members deem that this allocation range is either too small or too large, a
vote may be proposed to change it.

The MANTRA DAO Foundation aims to support a wide variety of products and
companies as it continues to execute upon its roadmap of services. Initially, the
grants will look at companies that are using and building upon Parity Substrate and
interacting with the Web3 ecosystem or solving issues within decentralized staking
and lending services. As the MANTRA DAO ecosystem and service offerings grow, the
scope for the grants will widen and shift to best support the organization. These
companies are ideally self-operating, outside teams that have shown an ability to
execute upon a formulated strategy and plan. The MANTRA DAO Foundation
Members will provide some support in working with the grant obtaining teams to
help them best position themselves within the MANTRA DAO ecosystem. The
MANTRA DAO technical developer team will also work closely with the teams at
different stages of their development to make sure that their product and build-out
can be easily and securely integrated into MANTRA DAO.

Custody

The security of cryptocurrency assets is one of the most important elements in the
blockchain industry. Many blockchain companies have failed due to poor security
procedures. Most security breaches could have been prevented by taking simple
precautions to protect critical resources. MANTRA DAO will integrate a mix of non-
custodial and custodial wallet solutions depending on the specific service
offerings. When custody is required for specific services, MANTRA DAO will
use and leverage Rio Chain’s enterprise-grade security solution that utilizes the
strongest encryption technology available in order to have absolute trustworthiness.

As security is of the utmost importance for us, MANTRA DAO will focus on offering
non-custodial services for its initial staking business line through Delegated
Proof of Stake (DPoS) tokens. By utilizing and working with cryptocurrencies
that are DPoS, MANTRA DAO is able to greatly reduce security risk as it will
not be handling any of its members’ digital assets, having them remain at all
times in the members’ custody. As additional tokens are offered that are
Proof of Stake (PoS), we will maintain these through industry-leading security
solutions.

18
OM Token

MANTRA DAO and the MANTRA Protocol are only able to operate as a
community-governed, decentralized autonomous organization through its use
and integration of the OM token. OM tokens are the entry pieces for people
to become members into MANTRA DAO and are what allows them to decide
how they want the organization to operate. OM tokens grant members of
MANTRA DAO governance and voting rights, access to collateralized loans
and compounded interest, as well as entrance into MANTRA POOL’s savings
games.

Initial Membership Offering

OM tokens will initially become available to the public through MANTRA DAO’s
Initial Membership Offering (IMO). We are selling membership rights into a
next-generation decentralized financial ecosystem that’s structured as a DAO
to give financial freedom and decision-making abilities to its members.
People who participate in the MANTRA DAO IMO will be given OM tokens and
access to the MANTRA DAO platform, where they will be able to access a
broad range of financial services and rights within the ecosystem.

Asset Purchases

15% of the MANTRA DAO Foundation’s initial funds will be used to purchase assets to
operate our various staking-as-a-service nodes.

These assets will accrue staking rewards, of which:
° 50% will be used to re-purchase OM tokens for future staking & referral rewards
° 25% will be rewarded to users of the MANTRA POOL savings game

° 25% will be re-staked to grow the MANTRA DAO Foundation’s assets under
management (AUM) on behalf of its beneficiaries, the OM token holders

Burning

Every time a MANTRA DAO member burns an OM token in order to enter the
MANTRA POOL or uses OM to pay interest on a loan taken out through
MANTRA LENDING, that OM is sent and collected in the MANTRA DAO burn
wallet. Every quarter, we will burn, in its entirety, all of the collected OM held in that
burn wallet. All transactions will be transparent and completed on Rio Chain. We
could eventually burn up to 50% of the total OM supply, leaving 50% remaining.

Vesting

The MANTRA DAO team and advisors’ OM will be vested on a 24-month (2-year)
timeline with OM being released at the beginning of every month in the amount of
4.167% or 1/24" (5,926,399.9940736 OM).

The Private Sale participating members will be vested on a 6-month timeline with
OM being released at the beginning of every month in the amount of 16.67% or 1/6"
(13,333,333.3 OM).

Those members who join during the Public Sale will follow no vesting period and will
receive 100% of their tokens following the successful close of the Initial Membership
Offering.

21
KARMA Protocol

KARMA Protocol is a reputation mechanism that aims at rewarding members for their
contributions to the MANTRA DAO ecosystem. MANTRA DAO’s overarching goal of
bringing peace-of-mind to peoples’ control of their financial future cannot
happen without the support and participation of its members. The more
members participate, the more decentralized and autonomous MANTRA DAO
becomes. KARMA Protocol is a reputation system that plays a crucial part in the
MANTRA DAO ecosystem by rewarding and incentivizing its members for
performing positive actions within the organization.

Members who carry out different actions within MANTRA DAO are rewarded in
KARMA. The more KARMA a member has, the more benefits that member will receive
within the ecosystem. There are 10 tiers within the KARMA Protocol that unlock
different incentivization offerings that ultimately allow our members additional
opportunities to increase their OM holdings, decrease fees, earn rewards, and more.
Besides the amount of KARMA each user earns, users must also hit specific
requirements of staked OM in order to receive all of the rewards in that specific tier.

Users gain KARMA by supporting the ecosystem through:
* Staking OM tokens

* Taking out & paying back loans

¢ Submitting & voting on proposals

¢ Joining the MANTRA POOL savings game

¢ Referring friends to grow the community

¢ Receiving grants

Users with higher karma gain access to various benefits, such as:
* Increased OM staking rewards

* Decreased staking fees

¢ Free access to MANTRA POOL

* Lower loan interest rates

* Loyalty Rewards, such as SWAG and community recognition

MANTRA POOL requires members to burn at least 1 OM in order to take
part in the savings games. Besides just being able to participate in
MANTRA POOL by burning OM tokens, members that accumulate enough
KARMA are given free entries to participate in all offered MANTRA POOLs. Once
members hit the different KARMA levels, they will be automatically enrolled in
every game in the amount offered in their designated Tier.

OM token’s interest rate will be dependent on the circulating supply of OM and
how many OM are being staked at a given time. Depending on members’ KARMA
Tiers, they will be entitled to a percentage increase on whatever the OM token’s
interest rate is at that time. These interest rates will be automated and written
into smart contracts on the blockchain.

Staking fees will vary from each PoS or DPoS cryptocurrency that is supported and
offered on the MANTRA DAO platform. Depending on the specific fees
associated with the specific PoS / DPoS cryptocurrency, the KARMA Tier
levels will allocate a reduced percentage based on those fees at that time. These
reduced percentages on the fees will be automated and written into smart
contracts on Rio Chain.

Loan interest rates will be calculated based on the assets that users are borrowing
against and the pre-determined rates at that time. Depending on the given interest
rates at any specific time, users who qualify in specific KARMA Tiers will receive a
discounted rate in real-time. These reduced percentages on the interest rates will
be automated and written into smart contracts on Rio Chain.

25
MANTRA DAO Foundation

MANTRA DAO Foundation is established as a registered separate legal entity, without
owners. Its initial assets are donated to the foundation and are managed by its
councilors on behalf of its beneficiaries. A foundation’s council (analogous to a
company’s board of directors) manages and administers foundation assets in
accordance with its purpose as detailed in the terms of its charter and regulations.
Persons who become members of this Foundation become its beneficiaries and are
collectively known as the "Members" or singly as a "Member". Interests of the
Members of the Foundation are denominated in "Units”, which are represented by
OM tokens.

Seychelles foundations are provided for under the Seychelles Foundations Act 2009
as amended by the Foundations (Amendment) Act 2011 (together the “Act”). The Act
strikes an effective balance between sound regulation and market attractiveness.

Foundations are often formed for wealth management purposes, and are commonly
used to hold investments such as company shares, bonds and real estate, or
cryptocurrencies and digital tokens. MANTRA DAO Foundation will own 100% of the
shares MANTRA DAO IBC, a Seychelles International Business Corporation (IBC),
which will operate all business activities in service of the Foundation on behalf of its
Members.

Approximately 15% of all funds raised will go toward purchasing cryptocurrency
assets and nodes to operate the staking-as-a-service business on behalf of the
Members.

The staking rewards from the Foundation’s assets will be used as follows:
° 50% will be used to buyback OM tokens on secondary exchanges
° 25% will be used as rewards for the MANTRA POOL savings game

° 25% will be re-staked to grow the Foundation’s assets under management
(AUM) on behalf of its Members

For additional details on how MANTRA DAO Foundation will operate, please see
Appendix A & B.

Parity-W3F-Polkadot

MANTRA DAO Foundation collaborates with leading Blockchain organizations at both
technical and business levels.

Web 3 Foundation

Web3 Foundation was created to nurture and steward technologies and applications in
the fields of decentralized web software protocols, particularly those that utilize
modern cryptographic methods to safeguard decentralization, to the benefit and for the
stability of the Web3 ecosystem. Polkadot is the flagship protocol of Web3 Foundation.

Parity Technologies

Web3 Foundation has commissioned Parity Technologies to build Polkadot. Founded by
Ethereum cofounder Dr. Gavin Wood, Parity is a global team of top distributed systems
engineers, cryptographers, solutions architects and researchers. Parity has
fundamentally shaped the blockchain industry, from building the highly-adopted Parity
Ethereum client and implementations of Bitcoin and Zcash, to developing the next
generation of blockchain technology with Substrate and Polkadot.

Polkadot

Polkadot is a next-generation blockchain protocol that unites an entire network of
purpose-built blockchains, allowing them to operate seamlessly together at scale.
Because Polkadot allows any type of data to be sent between any type of blockchain, it
unlocks a wide range of real-world use cases.

By bringing together the best features from multiple specialized blockchains, Polkadot
paves the way for new decentralized marketplaces to emerge, offering fairer ways to
access services through a variety of apps and providers.

While blockchains have demonstrated great promise in several fields—Internet of
Things (loT), finance, governance, identity management, web decentralization, and
asset-tracking to name a few—design limitations in previous systems have largely
hindered large-scale adoption. Polkadot’s design offers several distinct advantages over
existing and legacy networks, including heterogeneous sharding, scalability,
upgradeability, transparent governance and cross-chain composability.

27
Rio Chain

Existing blockchains are too slow, too rigid, and too foreign to traditional digital
infrastructure to be used by most institutions and organizations. Blockchains must
meet businesses’ requirements in order to be successful and implementable.

Rio Chain iterates over previous generations of blockchain networks such as Bitcoin
and Ethereum. Built with Substrate and focusing on security and usability, Rio Chain
introduces greater interoperability, scalability, increased network speeds, and cross-
chain transactions. It is for this reason that we have chosen to use Rio Chain to power
the MANTRA DAO platform.

Rio Chain is a hybrid blockchain that is powering Rio Wallet and a host of dApps in
the Rio ecosystem (explained in more detail on RioChain.io and in the Rio Chain
Whitepaper).

Rio Wallet

There currently exists a big gap in the creation of digital asset wallets and their user-
friendliness. Sending, receiving, and using cryptocurrencies or any digital assets should
be as easy as the push of a button and should not be something that requires multiple
steps. With this in mind, we have created a seamless, easy-to-use wallet to power Rio
Chain.

Rio Wallet is not only a secure storage medium for cryptocurrencies, but also allows
participants to access a suite of payment services and uses within the Rio DeFi

ecosystem through various decentralized applications (dApps).

Rio Fuel

ORioFuel

Rio Chain’s native token — Rio Fuel (RFUEL) — is a unit that measures the amount of
computational resources used to execute operations on Rio Chain, and is required to
conduct any transactions or execute any smart contracts within the Rio Chain
ecosystem, including all of its dApps. Any OM token transactions will require the use
of RFUEL since they are Rio Chain’s native tokens. Each Rio Wallet comes pre-loaded
with 10 free RFUEL, which can be used to initiate 100 actions on Rio Chain as the
transaction fee is only 0.1 RFUEL for most actions. Rio Chain will ensure that
transaction costs remain vastly cheaper than traditional blockchains.

100 million RFUEL
tokens are pre-

minted, a majority of
which are distributed
to users’ wallets

MANTRA DAO

Community Governed DeFi Platform
Appendix A: REGULATIONS OF MANTRA DAO FOUNDATION

Section 1. Purpose. The purpose of MANTRA DAO Foundation is to hold shares of
MANTRA DAO IBC, a Seychelles International Business Corporation (IBC), which will
operate all business activities in service of the Foundation on behalf of its Members. This
IBC will operate as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) through which it can
accept requests to perform services for its Members or third parties, solicit bids on such
requests from Members and non-Members, and permit Members to allocate responsibility
and remuneration of Members and others for completion of related tasks. The Foundation
may transact such other lawful business as the Members may determine in accordance
with these regulations.

Section 2. Powers. The Foundation may engage in any and all activities that may lawfully
be performed by a Seychelles Foundation under the Seychelles Foundations Act, 2009 (the
"Act"), and other applicable laws.

Section 3. Governance; Type of Decentralized Ledger; Security Protocols; Tax Elections.

(a) Governance. The Foundation intends to govern itself and conduct all of its activities
through the use of blockchain technology, software-enabled governance procedures and
protocols, and associated voting protocols, including but not limited to: (a) admission or
expulsion of Members and approval or denial of Member Unit transfer requests; (b)
proposed upgrades to or modifications of the Foundation’s DAO, software, and/or
protocols; (c) proposed changes to these regulations; (d) bids or proposals to perform work
for third parties; (e) bids or proposals for Members or non-Members to perform work for
the Foundation and/or third parties and receive payment and Reputation therefor in their
individual capacities; and (f) any other matter of governance or other activity the
Foundation finds necessary or convenient to have its Members determine collectively. The
software-enabled governance procedures and protocols adopted from time to time by the
Foundation, together with this document, shall jointly constitute the regulations of the
Foundation. The initial version of such governance procedures and protocols is described
in Appendix B to this document, but the current version of governance procedures shall, at
all times, be determined by and stored on the DAO. Subject to the foregoing provisions and
the provisions of Section 6, the Foundation shall be governed by its Members, collectively.

42
(b) Type of Decentralized Ledger. The Foundation will utilize a decentralized, publicly-
available ledger (the "Ledger"). Information about participants’ permissions and ability
to read and write protocols to the ledger is set out in Appendix B.

(c) Security Protocols. The Foundation believes that the use of blockchain technology
and a DAO structure provide ample security, but has nonetheless established security
protocols to address and mitigate risk. Information about those Security Protocols is set
out in Appendix B.

(d) Tax Status. No taxation. Seychelles foundations are completely exempt from any
form of taxes in Seychelles, meaning that all income and gains of any kind of the
Foundation are not taxable in Seychelles. Distributions to beneficiaries, fees paid to
investment advisors and similar are also tax exempt. Note: U.S. taxpayers and those
from countries taxing global income are required to report all income to their tax
authorities.

Section 4. Units; Outside Work and Duties; Compensation; Capital Accounts;
Foundation Funds.

(a) Units. The Foundation will have Units, called OM tokens; their supply fluctuates in
accordance with the economic parameters of the smart contracts and decided upon by
the DAO’s members. The voting power of each staked Unit will initially be 1 (1 staked
OM token = 1 voting power). Future iterations of the protocol may have voting power
vary in accordance with the corresponding Unit holder’s KARMA, as determined from
time to time by the Members through the DAO, or by such other methodology
determined from time to time by the Members through the DAO. The number of Units
in the Foundation held by each of the Members as of the date of this document and
thereafter will be as determined by the smart contract protocols of the DAO. Unit
records will be updated dynamically as Members are admitted or leave the Foundation
and if Members transfer their Units to others. The Foundation neither expects nor
intends to amend its written Charter to reflect such changes, as all such information will
be stored on the DAO and accessible to Members therein.

43
(b) Outside Work and Duties. Members, including Councillors, are permitted to work
for and have outside business interests in companies and organizations besides the
Foundation, and such work or interests will not violate any duties or obligations of
Members or Councillors to the Foundation. No Member will have any fiduciary duty to
the Foundation for any contractor work done for the Foundation, unless the Members
vote to approve such a fiduciary duty and the Member concerned consents to it.

(c) Compensation. Members, Councillors, and non-Members may _ receive
compensation as independent contractors on particular tasks undertaken through the
Foundation as approved from time to time through the DAO structure, including, but
not limited to, for services of the Councillor to the Foundation and services by any
Member or non-Member to a third party on behalf of the Foundation or directly to the
Foundation, at such times and amounts approved by vote of the Members or as
established in the regulations. Neither Members, Councillors, nor non-Members will
receive distributions from the Foundation aside from such compensation, unless the
Members or regulations approve such distributions.

(d) Foundation Funds. Foundation funds may consist of traditional currency or of digital
assets, including, but not limited to, cryptocurrencies and digital tokens. All Foundation
funds consisting of traditional currency shall be deposited in such bank accounts or
invested as designated by the Councillors. Foundation funds consisting of digital assets
shall be held in such a manner as may be designated by a vote of the Members. In
whatever form, such funds shall not be commingled with funds of any other entity
managed, controlled, owned or advised by any of the Members. All withdrawals from
any traditional currency accounts shall be made only by a Councillor or by other
persons duly authorized by the Foundation to make such withdrawals. Transfers of
digital assets may be made by duly authorized persons or through duly authorized
"smart contracts" or other automatic means approved by the Members.

44
Section 5. Distributions; Financial Reporting; Books and Records.

(a) Distributions. The Members will make all decisions related to distributions of cash
or any form of currency (including, but not limited to, cryptocurrencies and digital
tokens). For the first two years, in order to efficiently create the DAO’s products and
services, the Foundation’s assets will be professionally managed by its initial
contributors, who will act in accordance with guidance from the Councillors and
advisors.

(b) Financial Reporting. Each Member agrees to be bound by the decisions of the
Members with respect to distributions and other aspects of the Foundation’s
accounting.

(c) Books and Records. The Foundation books and records shall be kept in accordance
with the accounting methods determined by the Members to be most advantageous to
the Foundation for financial and reporting purposes. The books and records shall be
open to the reasonable inspection and examination of the Members or their duly
authorized representatives upon request.

Section 6. Management; Councillor; Indemnification.

(a) Management. The business, operations and affairs of the Foundation will be
managed under the direction of the Members in accordance with the governance
procedures described in this Charter. The use of Councillor(s) described below is for
convenience of administration and is not intended to diminish the fundamental role of
the Members as a whole in directing the operations and affairs of the Foundation.

45
(b) Councillor. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6(a) above, in order to
maintain a centralized point of contact with the outside world, the Foundation will, at
all times, have one or more Councillors with the limited authority described in this
Charter, who will be selected from among the Members by vote of the Members, the
first of whom shall be the individuals referenced in Appendix B. If the Members name
multiple Councillors to act at any given time, each such Councillor will have the power
to act individually on behalf of the Foundation, independent of the other Councillors,
unless decided otherwise by the Members. Councillors may also be required to post a
surety related to the faithful performance of managerial duties, if so determined by the
Members. Councillors may be removed or replaced and one or more Councillors may
also be named, also by vote of the Members. The Councillor(s) will have primary
responsibility for interacting with third party service providers and officials (e.g.
accountants, attorneys, government officials and departments) on behalf of the
Foundation and such other tasks as the Members or this Charter may assign. The
Councillor(s) will have the power to execute or file any document required or permitted
to be executed or filed on behalf of a Foundation under the Act. A Councillor, like any
Member of the Foundation, may fulfill multiple roles within the Foundation, including
but not limited to, Member, Councillor, developer, contractor, voter, or other participant
in the DAO operated by the Foundation. Within their authority, Councillors may act as
agents of the Foundation. No other Member will be an agent of the Foundation solely
by reason of being a Member.

(c) Indemnification. Any Member, including a Councillor, may request indemnification
by the Foundation for his, her, or its acts for or on behalf of the Foundation, including,
but not limited to, actions related to a particular bid by a Member to perform work for
or on behalf of the Foundation. Indemnification may be granted or approved through
the same Member voting process or regulations used to govern the Foundation’s
activities and operations.

46
Appendix B: MATERIAL INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN APPENDIX A

3(a) The initial version of such governance procedures and protocols will consist of the
following, which may be changed at any time by vote of the Members through the DAO:

The Rio Chain smart contract framework. This consists of a set of smart contracts
deployed on Rio Chain that define the basic building blocks and standard
components that can be used to implement any dApp.

The latest release of Rio Chain’s protocol can be found at
https://github.com/RioDefi/riochain

Members of the Foundation will use the DAO protocol to vote on all proposed
governance matters related to the Foundation and on all proposed projects
submitted to the Foundation through the DAO, which may include proposals for the
DAO to perform work for outside clients and proposals for DAO Members and/or
non-Members to perform work for or on behalf of the DAO in exchange for digital
currency or tokens.

KARMA is a non-transferrable balance associated with a cryptographic address,
meant to gauge a user’s reputation and positive actions within the community. An
address with a positive KARMA balance, who is staking at least 1 OM token, will be
considered a Member. Each Member will maintain at least one KARMA, but voting
power in the DAO will be calculated according to Members’ staked OM tokens,
meaning that Members with higher amounts of staked OM will have greater voting
power. Note that future upgrades, voted on by Members, may also utilize KARMA
balances to calculate voting power. KARMA will be awarded and adjusted by smart
contracts, per the specifications set by the DAO, and can also be adjusted by votes
of the Members through the DAO protocol.

Non-Members may become Members of the DAO and receive KARMA if they stake
at least 1 OM token. Only Members may submit and vote on proposals.

Proposals by Members may involve requests for KARMA in exchange for work.

When proposals are approved through the DAO protocol, the DAO will approve
awarding the submitting Member the digital currency, tokens, and KARMA (if any)
associated with that proposal.

Whenever a non-Member client desires the Foundation or the DAO perform a
project, a proposal for the same must be submitted to a vote of the Members
through the DAO protocol. A Member may submit the proposal on behalf of a
client, providing such details as needed to allow the Members to consider the
proposal. Neither Members nor Councillors may unilaterally agree that the DAO will
perform a project for a third party without first obtaining the consent of the
Members through the DAO protocol.

47
Non-Members for whom the DAO agrees to perform work will receive the address
of the DAO that allows the non-Members to pay the Foundation. The DAO will
award that payment to those Members and/or non-Members whose proposals to
perform the same work are also approved by the Members through the DAO
protocol.

3(b) The Foundation’s distributed ledger will consist of Rio Chain. The smart contracts
that define the Foundation’s protocol will limit write permissions for certain
functionality, such as the ability to vote on a proposal, to Members’ cryptographic
addresses.

3(c) The Foundation’s security protocols are subject to the following provisions:

Blockchains and smart contracts are highly experimental and subject to security
breaches. Members acknowledge that the Foundation may be affected by A) bugs
in the smart contracts that comprise the Foundation’s protocol or B) issues in the
underlying ledger, such as integration issues due to chain upgrades, or other
unforeseen technical issues.

If a bug is discovered that compromises the integrity of the Foundation’s protocol,
all funds shall be temporarily moved to a Multisignature Wallet ("Multisig") if
possible. The Multisig shall be jointly controlled by the Councillor(s), and
authorization of at least two such individuals will be required to release funds
from the Multisig.

When the patch is complete and the software is stable, the Multisig shall redeploy
the DAO with all previous data (such as KARMA distribution and proposal history)
if it is technically feasible to do so. Following a successful redeploy, the Multisig
shall return all funds to the DAO.

The initial Councillors will be: James Anderson, Stephane Laurent, John Patrick
Mullen, Will Corkin, and Jamie Cheng.

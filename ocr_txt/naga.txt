THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER
1.EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The NAGA Development Association Ltd. (“NDAL”) has partnered with The NAGA Group AG (“NAGA”)
to introduce the NAGA COIN (“NGC”), a utility token that will serve as the unit of account in all
existing and future projects of NAGA.

The NAGA Group AG is a German holding of technology companies which was founded in 2015 and
is listed on the German Stock Exchange (the group companies of the NAGA Group AG hereinafter
collectively referred to as “NAGA”). Over the last 2 years, NAGA has raised over $15m in capital
from various prestigious investors, such as one of Europe’s oldest banks Hauck & Aufhaeuser
(founded 1796) and from China’s largest private investment conglomerate FOSUN. NAGA also per-
formed the fastest German IPO within the last 15 years.!

The company employs more than 120 people and operates in the capital markets and gaming
domain. On the 10*” of July 2017, NAGA AG was listed at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange with an
issuing price of €2.60 per stock. Just 3 months later, the stock price is trading over 400% above
the issue price and has become one of the most successful and most traded retail stocks in Ger-
many.

NAGA specializes in the development of cutting edge technology for capital markets and gaming.
The company operates and owns an EU-licensed brokerage company, one of the fastest growing
social networks for trading (NAGA TRADER ) with millions of EUR in realized revenues, and a virtual
goods exchange (Switex), which is backed by one of the world’s largest exchanges as a Joint Ven-
ure partner. NAGA’s technology expertise ranges from financial markets, robo-advisory and algo-
rading to gaming and blockchain technology.

Given the fact that the financial service sector is still inaccessible (it still unnecessarily requires
banks) for over 2 billion people and heavily complex, with non-transparent cost structures, and that
here is no central solution to these problems, NAGA’s mission is to open up the world of trading
inancial and virtual goods to everyone in one unified platform. NAGA identified three major prob-
lems of the financial service sector: Firstly, it is still inaccessible for over 2 billion people and heavily
complex. Secondly, there are no one-stop solutions where users can securely and reliably store
heir data and have a complete product offering for trading. Thirdly, cost structures in these sectors
are non-transparent and disadvantageous to the user.

NAGA’s mission is to open up the world of trading financial and virtual goods to everyone.

After building up a team of 120 dedicated and motivated people, spending tens of millions of EUR
on licenses and technology, as well as establishing a business that has hundreds of thousands of
clients, millions of EUR in revenues, and billions of EUR in trading volume, NAGA formulated the
credo “Power to the people”. As a logical next step, NAGA is introducing a decentralized unit of
account on its platforms - The NAGA Coin (NGC). The NGC will unite all platforms in the NAGA
ecosystem through its own wallet service called The NAGA WALLET. The NAGA WALLET aims to

http://www.smc-research.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2017-06-08-SMC-Studie-NAGA-Group.pdf

THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER
bridge NAGA’s two major projects and enable an ecosystem for the social trading of cryptocurren-
cies, virtual goods and stocks. The concept of enabling gamers to turn their passion into a wealth
generating hobby has been a dream come true for many millennials, and NAGA’s goal is to make
this a reality.

Hence, the digital NAGA ecosystem powered by the NGC will give everyone the ability to convert any
currency to crypto-currencies, along with access to stocks or virtual in-game goods across various
platforms. It will allow everyone to trade at a transparent cost structure, and receive cashback and
bonuses through a sophisticated token economy framework. Ultimately the NAGA WALLET will serve
as a one-stop shop solution that ensures that users’ currency is stored on a secure and reliable
platform. The NAGA team strongly believes that the merging of an innovative, established and fast-
growing technology company driven by the community with the blockchain.

Against all concerns that were raised before the fastest IPO of the past 15 years in Germany, NAGA
won over the entire German Stock market and generated a 400% return on its share price for all
early contributors. It was in its first week after the IPO, Germany’s most traded retail stock - more
than Apple or Tesla.

Given NAGA’s partner’s NDAL mission statement to democratize the world of trading and the big
momentum around blockchain, NAGA creates, with the NAGA Coin, another opportunity to be an
early contributor and benefit from the token and platform growth.

As a publicly listed company, The NAGA Group AG combines many key advantages for token hold-
ers. The most important key advantages are listed below:

e A listed German entity with millions of EUR in yearly revenues, billions of EUR in trading
volume, and several hundred thousand transactions per month.2

e The NAGA Group AG stock has attracted massive press attention and was even considered
one of the top traded retail shares in Germany.

e The roadmap is unlike others “already written” - NAGA has the users, the technology, and
millions in revenues and billions in trading revenue! The core mission is simply the growth
of NAGA’s crypto-economy.

e Amanagement owned and growth-driven young international FinTech company with a great
team of more than 120 people.

e NAGA owns various EU-financial licenses, including an asset management license and is
built on a state of the art legal setup.

e In partnership with NAGA’s shareholder, the Chinese Fosun Group, the first steps for an
expansion into the Asian markets have already taken place.

e With NAGA TRADER, NAGA has an existing product generating multi-million USD in yearly
revenues, driven by thousands of users and featuring its own robo-advisor called CYBO.3

e With Switex NAGA has a virtual item exchange in alpha phase based on a partnership with
leading players in the industry, including a DAX30 company.

financial and gaming industries.

2.INTRODUCING NAGA

2.1 THE COMPANY

After performing one of the fastest IPOs and being listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange on July
the 10th 2017, The NAGA Group AG (ISIN: DEOOOA161NR7) is currently offering two platforms
around the trading of financial instruments and virtual items. Founded with the mission to make
financial transactions in stocks, cryptocurrencies and the gaming market more transparent, secure
and accessible to everyone, the NAGA team stands for disruptive and innovative solutions in the
online trading and gaming world. The first venture of NAGA is the online trading platform and social
network for traders, NAGA TRADER , which has been operating since early 2015. The NAGA TRADER
trading platform accommodates thousands of registered users and facilitates several thousand
transactions each month. The second venture, Switex, is currently under development and will be-
launched in Q1 2018.

Figure 3: NAGA Ecosystem

NAGA has a CySec-regulated brokerage firm and asset management company within the group
called NAGA Markets Ltd. (former Hanseatic Brokerhouse Global Markets Ltd.), which is based in
Cyprus and specializes in Forex and CFD trading. Furthermore, NAGA’s sales and lead-generating
engine HBS AG (Hanseatic Brokerhouse Germany & Spain) focuses on the acquisition and support
of traditional customers in the trading segment. NAGA TRADER (available for los, Android and Web),
which is directly connected to NAGA Markets Ltd., supplements the company’s product offering and
allows customers to access a more modern and mobile-oriented trading platform. NAGA TRADER ’
technology solution also offers open interfaces for other third-party brokers® which are able to ben-
efit from the company’s technology. Depending on the strategic orientation, NAGA therefore can
expand its own ecosystem through its own network, as well as through a stronger involvement of
partners.

Next to NAGA TRADER , NAGA’s second venture Switex also embodies enormous disruption poten-
tial and is the ideal addition to the ecosystem as it allows for the connection of the financial trading

world with the gaming world. With several offices across major European countries, including Ger-
many (2 offices in Hamburg), Spain (offices in Barcelona, Madrid, Valencia and Palma de Mallorca),
and Cyprus (Limassol), NAGA today has access to more than 20,000 paying clients from more than
100 countries.

Within its ecosystem, NAGA combines elements of social media networks (chats, channels, video
and ad server, follow and watch functions) in its products alongside the more classical approach of
trading. Users of the platform produce daily contributions (so-called “User-Generated Content”)
without NAGA paying for it. Similar to platforms such as Twitter, LinkedIn or Facebook, the commu-
nity creates and shares content themselves and free of charge, thereby enhancing viral growth
without incurring any additional costs for NAGA.

2.2 NAGA’s VISION FOR THE FUTURE OF TRADING

NAGA doesn’t just believe in decentralized and transparent data but also in the power of decentral-
ized services. NAGA’s vision of the all-in-one platform for financial services is not geographically
bound by borders. Today’s technology and regulation allows NAGA to create a decentralized third-
party marketplace that brings the leading financial technology to everyone around the globe. The
trading platform of the future not only offers trading with cryptocurrencies, but also a fully functional
infrastructure based around blockchain technology, allowing everyone to trade financial instru-
ments as well as virtual products, such as virtual goods. Decentralisation offers the most promising
path to NAGA’s vision of a sustainable future in online trading.

Especially over the last years, the global financial markets have become heavily complex; they are
over-regulated and discriminate against the retail clients who would like to participate. All of this is
currently changing with the evolution of the blockchain technology, a disruptive economic technol-
ogy that allows every person, even those without a bank account, to participate in the financial
markets. Combining expertise in regulated markets together with expertise in blockchain technol-
ogy creates unique solutions for online trading that are tailored towards approaching the broader
market. The power behind NAGA is the NAGA Coin (NGC) or digital token. All activity in the network
evolves around NGC, from serving as the primary form for fees and collateral, to serving as the
main base currency for any transactions. NGC is the driver of a sustainable economy where demand
grows as more and more users, financial institutions, and game-publishers join the NAGA ecosys-
tem.

With the NAGA Coin of NDAL, NAGA aims to establish the world’s first crypto-gateway to trade
stocks, CFDs, ETFs, and any other sort of financial instruments and virtual goods on a global scale
in a secure and transparent way. NAGA shall become the trading platform for any financial or virtual
product of the future. It’s time for you to be able to buy any stock or game item with your NAGA
tokens or other cryptocurrencies, let a personalized and unique robo-advisor, called CYBO, invest
for you, and build your financial wealth with full transparency and efficiency with low or no transac-
tion costs.

3. NAGA ECOSYSTEM

3.1 BUILD TO SCALE

The NAGA ecosystem already embraces a large number of online trading brokers, financial institu-
tions, (and in the future) even more game-publishers for Switex. NAGA is an open API universe that
has already proven to be able to handle multiple providers in real time in the most (time) sensitive
and regulated market. Several providers are already live and connected and allow NAGA to scale
faster than its peers. After connecting several brokers around the globe, such as FXCM and
BDSWISS’, NAGA TRADER is currently in the process of connecting Interactive Broker Inc.8 which
will allow the company to offer physical stocks on its platform. With a growing number of connected
providers, brokers and publishers, the NAGA ecosystem will grow exponentially. Together with its
partners, NAGA TRADER will form the largest community for stock traders around the globe. It will
add a peer to peer component to its services and will expand with Switex into one of the largest
and fastest growing markets worldwide. NGC will literally bring cryptocurrencies and financial prod-
ucts to the masses.

With 2+ billion users in the gaming industry and by targeting the largest financial market in the
world (the foreign exchange market (Forex) with 5.1 trillion USD traded everyday2: as well as the
equity markets with more than 65 trillion USD market 18witex18ualized), NAGA is the first and only
to tackle those two markets at the same time and is highly prepared for a transformation into the
crypto and blockchain world. When it comes to the online trading industry, positive future develop-
ment is expected. In recent years, the daily trading volume of the entire brokerage industry has
risen to 321 billion USD. A further increase of the daily volume is expected in the future.9 Looking
at the steady increase of users of the leading apps in the social trading and gaming area, the overall
market climate is very positive.1°

3.2 NAGA ENTITIES

NAGA identifies itself as a group of FinTech companies serving customers around the globe. NAGA
is also active in Asia, in which its services/products are already offered, and marketed. As part of
the Asian initiative of the company, also based on NAGA’s existing relationship with its largest
shareholder Fosun, connections with Asian based brokerage companies have already been devel-
oped and will be publicly announced in 2018.

NAGA is committed to creating a system dedicated to social trading and investing in financial in-
struments, virtual goods and cryptocurrencies. NAGA’s goal is to make a complicated market sim-
ple, fun, social, entertaining, rewarding and safe for everyone - especially for 2 billion underbanked
people.

THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER
3.2.1 NAGA TRADER - the Social Network for Traders

NAGA TRADER is a subsidiary of NAGA, offering a unique concept that enables retail clients to trade
Forex, Indices, Stocks, ETFs and CFDs by copying other traders. The company has been operating
since June 2016 and currently has partnerships with 8 brokers.1t NAGA TRADER offers trading
functionality within the environment of a social network. The platform is thus intended to be more
appealing to younger users, who have not dared to enter into the complex financial markets world
before. It opens the trading world to a much broader audience, such as gamers, who can start with
a virtual demo version. The platform offers an environment to the user in which he/she can share
knowledge with other users, copy the trades of others, and trade or invest money. Besides the
option to open an account with NAGA, the product enables the user the freedom to link one of their
already existing brokerage accounts with NAGA TRADER .

CRYPTOs AUTO COPY LEADERBOARD CHATS & CHANNELS

Figure 4: NAGA TRADER Features

If a user shares his trades with the community and gets copied by others, NAGA TRADER pays a
compensation bonus to the trade initiator. As a result, traders have the unique potential to passively
earn money while trading on the NAGA TRADER platform. The compensation is directly credited to
the user’s account and can be withdrawn at any time. If a trader decides to copy a trade, there is
the possibility to copy one single trade or to copy all the trades of a single trader (auto-copying).

NAGA TRADER provides a stand-alone offering in comparison to other social trading networks, like
eToro or Ayondo, which just offer the possibility to just copy all trades of a single trader within the
network. On NAGA TRADER each trader can be the expert. NAGA TRADER also offers its users the
possibility to follow other users, and to subscribe to and comment on news and user interactions.
In addition, the platform offers a full robo-advisory solution. The algorithms and artificial intelligence
of CYBO are described below. The simple and easy-to-use interface, combined with various fea-
tures, have led to high user loyalty with users spending on average more than 23 minutes on the

platform, a figure which exceeds the average daily usage of apps such a Facebook, Snapchat, Twit-
ter, or Instagram.12

NAGA TRADER is by definition a software company acting as an Introducing Broker (IB) and holding
the required licenses through a partnership (umbrella regulation) with NAGA Markets Ltd. NAGA
TRADER generates its revenues mainly through commissions on transactions. Moreover, NAGA
TRADER also follows a B2B approach which is based on its advertisement server and big data
analytics.

3.2.2 Switex- Virtual Goods Exchange

Switex will be the first legal market eco-system for virtual goods, which will enable gamers, game
developers and publishers to profit fairly. Furthermore, Switex will enter the immense games mar-
ket with over 1.8 billion gamers and over $108 billion14 in revenues worldwide. In light of the fact
that there are still nearly 50% of the world population25 without internet, the number of gamers will
most likely increase over the next few decades and the games market will be far more significant
as new generations grow up with games/gamified content around them. An indication of the hidden
potential in gaming can be seen in the E-Sports market, which has seen an explosive revenue
growth in the last few years from $325 million in 2015 to over $696 million in 2017, with the
prediction that this will grow again to $1.5 billion in 2020.%¢

NAGA has set up a 2-step-plan. First, Switex aims to disrupt the gaming industry. Secondly, a mar-
ketplace will be opened for other virtual items. The Switex platform will be the first independent,
safe and legal virtual goods exchange accessible to all gamers and all publishers equally. Users of
the platform will be able to buy items for their games from both the publisher and other users of

the platform, offering a first and secondary market for in-game items. The secondary market will
allow players to offer their items to other players for sale or acquire the items of others to use in
their particular games. Switex therefore aims to be both the Amazon and eBay for in-game items.

Figure 6: Switex - Desktop Item View & Mobile Item View

Any item entering the Switex system will be secured through a blockchain-technology-based system
and therefore this exchange will be secured against fraud and scamming. The legitimacy of the in-
game items, its origins and the sellers right to sell will be verified and therefore Switex will ensure
a seamless and safe transaction between users.

Players will be able to transfer their items into and out of the Switex-platform without having to
worry about security. It can be stated that Switex will provide a legal alternative to the grey markets
that exist today, where virtual goods (in-game items) can be bought and sold legally. Switex is not
only a marketplace for offers but also a fully integrated clearance and settlement system which
ensures that items will be automatically transferred to the new owner’s game - upon the user’s
wish. In order to manage the virtual goods - regardless of their origin (e.g. games, concert tickets
or any virtual good) - the Switex platform will always have a direct and secure connection to the
virtual goods providers.

3.2.3 CYBO - Robo-Advisory Solution

In June 2016, the NAGA Team came up with the concept of “CYBO”, an investment robot which
analyses crowd trading and combines this with artificial intelligence, making it the first investment
advisor which is driven by human (crowd-based) & artificial intelligence. CYBO is an automated,
algorithm-driven financial planning service. The idea behind CYBO was the creation of a high-end,
technology-driven (as opposed to human interference) system that manages investments. This is
achieved in a multi-step process. CYBO learns the client’s personal preferences and investment
objectives. While the client can adjust his risk preferences and investment objectives at any mo-
ment, CYBO operates on the most recent and up-to-date information provided.

CYBO combines decades of experience in the brokerage business with state of the art technology.
NAGA TRADER users are offered a unique additional benefit, as CYBO collects, calibrates and com-
putes the intelligence of the crowd and reduces individual client’s mistakes in trading. It helps a
client to eliminate emotional reactions and missed trading opportunities. CYBO is a script/software
that runs on a mobile device, desktop or tablet. It was designed in a way to copy the best trades of
the top NAGA TRADER traders. CYBO analyses individual traders’ past performance and monitors
the current positions. CYBO constantly monitors numerous financial and technical market indica-
tors, like market volatility, market trends, price action, upcoming news, and economic events. It
picks only the best trades that fit the criteria NAGA TRADER has developed. CYBO’s key priorities
are the following:

e Provide the best market opportunities.

e Control risk and trade more profitably.

e Diversify between followed traders and selected trading instruments.
e Provide a comfortable way of trading.

The user decides when to start, pause or completely disable their personal CYBO. Furthermore, the
user is able to set his/her individual trading preferences. Referring to NAGA TRADER back-testing
period between June 2016 and July 2017, CYBO outperformed other peer-to-peer investment ad-
visors. Given an investment allocation of €10,000, a CYBO was able to generate an annual return
of €1,600 (over 16%). Compared to the best robo-advisory solutions available in Germany, which
is solely focused on one core product (for example Scalable Capital or Ginmon who raised over
$50m in Venture capital), they achieved a performance return of 12.1% in 201617. Besides the
individual advisory approach, it is planned that CYBO will soon be managing a “CRYPTO INDEX
FUND”, allowing every token holder to benefit.

Meet CYBO our Robo Advisor

In 2017 the idea of managed portfolios and index fund portfolios has been on the rise. To shake
things up NAGA TRADER decided to provide its users with liquid exposure to the cryptocurrency
asset class by introducing a “CRYPTO INDEX FUND” managed by CYBO. This absolute-return in-
vestment product will cover TOP10 potential cryptocurrencies. CYBO will recalculate and re-
balance the INDEX on an automated repeating frequency. The fund’s investment approach is op-
portunity driven and “cryptocurrency-picking”. It is planned to include NAGA Tokens as a refer-
ence for the index-price-calculation and reporting.

can be mastered by completing the Degree Ladder, beginning with the Micro Degree. The very first
Degree gives an overview of the topic and provides the most essential knowledge. Higher Degrees
provide more insight, diversify the topic in further branches, and go more and more into detail until
the point where the student has reached both Micro and Macro Degrees, which allows the student
to apply for an undergraduate program. The NAGA Academy will operate fully within European reg-
ulations and thus the academic degrees will be internationally acknowledged.

Students can also profit from the immense business network of The NAGA Group AG, such as in-
vestors, shareholders and business partners. Internships, on-side case studies and the possibility

NAGA also plans to launch two more ventures solving problems in the industry of online trading.
Although further details related to the projects cannot be revealed at this stage, the plan is to
launch a peer-to-peer platform for CFD and stock trading. The transformative feature of the plat-
form will enable sophisticated retail traders to be trading from their own inventory with a mark-
up/down as opposed to acting as the client of an agent who charges a commission.

NAGA has a mobile application in its pipeline that provides face to face currency exchange by
matching individuals. By using the app, users will be granted the choice to exchange physical and
crypto currencies. The app offers a facility to exchange even small amounts of currency. In its next
stage of expansion, the app will allow people to connect with each other and build up a reliable
network to exchange money globally.

3.3 COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS

The business model of NAGA comprises the development, marketing and promotion of applications
in the area of financial technology and online trading. In this respect, there is a risk that other
companies with (much) more human and financial resources could enter the market as a compet-
itor and could possibly copy the business model of NAGA. These companies could offer more at-
tractive and competitive products and services, showing a longer company history, better estab-
lished customer relationships, and use their experience and resources in different ways in order to
compete with NAGA, e.g. through acquisitions, aggressive investment in marketing, or the offer of
more attractive conditions for customers, service providers and business partners. In addition,
other start-up companies, could get access to equity and debt capital significantly easier than
NAGA. Aa a result, NAGA might grow slower than expected thus losing its customers to its compet-
itors.

NAGA offers an operational business unit headquartered in Hamburg with additional operational
units in Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Palma de Mallorca, and Limassol. Future locations in Shang-
hai and New York are planned in order to directly address potential partners in the American and
Asian market. Based on the project-oriented corporate structure of NAGA, projects are managed
completely independently from each other. NAGA is able to develop cross-platform applications and
to provide whole technology interfaces for multiple platforms on desktop and mobile (los and An-
droid). The founders of NAGA jointly have long-term expertise and complementary experiences in
the fields of banking, law and technology (start-up). Due to the cultural diversity of its employees,
NAGA is highly internationally oriented and is in a position to provide up-to-date technologies, sys-
tem processes and structures, both in IT and business.

Since the start in 2015, NAGA has gained the trust of strong and internationally partners. In partic-
ular, NAGA partners are Hauck & Aufhauser and Fosun. Existing and future partnerships are utilized
by the exchange of knowledge, technology expansion, and synergy effects, allowing each partner
to benefit from the network. The NAGA TRADER technology is the cornerstone of all NAGA products.

It is adaptive, so that new business models can be implemented quickly and efficiently. The proto-
type for the planned software Switex is based on these modules. Thanks to the technological focus
of NAGA, numerous new projects and innovative functions can be developed in short time periods,
allowing the company to move fast and to scale aggressively.

The entire NAGA TRADER system, for instance, is self-learning and has established a “Social Fi-
nance Graph” which is a specifically designed algorithm that combines social-based user interac-
tion with a user’s trading interactions and correlates with the interaction of other users. With each
interaction of users, be it trading, copying, sharing or consuming content, the system learns per-
sonal preferences of individual users. The collection of user’s social-economic data is used to seg-
ment specific user groups and target their preferences. This approach is key to more effective in-
bound marketing and enhances the scale effects of the platforms. Within the first months of oper-
ations of the NAGA TRADER platform, the following advantages in comparison to its competitors
were observed:

e Customer acquisition is up to 5 times cheaper than the industry average according to in-
ternal evaluations.

Existing users refer new users free of charge through recommendations (so-called viral
growth). The issuer’s internal evaluations show lower customer acquisition costs com-
pared to competitors.

THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER
It is estimated that there are around 1.8 billion gamers worldwide.22 As the accessibility to the
internet highly correlates with the number of gamers, there is still a lot of potential left in this mar-
ket. Also, the increasing dominance of the mobile sector (mobile phones, tablets etc.) leads to a
wider coverage with gaming enabled products, such as today’s smartphones & tablets. In 2018, it
is predicted that the mobile sector will outperform the traditional Consoles and PCs sectors in the
global gaming industry, which will then be worth $112 billion.23 Despite this being such an immense
and significant market, there are still many rudimentary problems. Fraud, scamming, and money
laundering are still big issues in the so-called “black-markets” for virtual goods. Gamers who trust
these kinds of services will most likely suffer from being scammed and lose either their money or
item because there is no trustworthy system which ensures the transaction.

Switex will solve these issues by offering a legal, trustworthy and easy way to trade items. It is
estimated that the virtual goods market worldwide is worth over $40 billion (2016).24 The global
games market has continuously grown with over 8% CAGR since 2013.25 This market in particular
brings very promising business opportunities for Switex, since there are no other consolidated, legal
and widely accessible cross-gaming-platform and cross-games-trading platform such as Switex will
be. Moreover, Switex will always have a direct link to the game publisher and thus ensure a safe,
legal and convenient way for the gamer to trade items and for the game publisher (or developer) to
promote new items, activate gamers, and participate in its users’ activity in the vast Switex eco-
system. Switex sees the following points as advantages over similar or black markets:

e Switex will be the first open, transparent and fair platform for virtual goods.
e Switex will always have low fees.

e Virtual goods from mobile games could be transferred to a user with a pc-game (if this is
allowed by the game publisher).

e Switex has received huge interest from Asia and is currently in very close discussions with
big and influential game publishers from that region.

In Switex’ opinion, the amount of data generated within the NAGA Ecosystem in comparison to other
services, and on the basis of the relatively high daily usage times of users, allows additional income
through targeted marketing (via its own add-server) and to market according to specific user char-
acteristics. Likewise, the data volume leads to faster adaptation of self-learning algorithms, such
as the self-developed CYBO technology, allowing each user to automate his trading by using a robo-
advisory tool according to their preferences.

CHAPTER 4
4.THE NAGA COIN

4.1 TOKEN SUPPLY AND SPECIFICATIONS

A total of over 77 million NAGA tokens were issued on the Ethereum blockchain using a smart
contract. NGC complies with the ERC-20 standard and is freely transferable on the Ethereum plat-
form. NAGA tokens do not indicate ownership of a company, NAGA does not pay dividends, and
NGC holders do not earn any direct interest (which - by the way - qualifies NGC as a Sharia-com-
pliant Islamic investment opportunity).26 The token is an integral part of NAGA’s economy, and its
value reflects the degree of penetration and activity within the platform. The more NGC are being
used within the NAGA Ecosystem - and thus driving customer adoption - the greater the demand
for NGC will be. As NAGA’s popularity grows and more users join the platform, new features will be
released, which will further increase the interest among NGC token holders. The exact details about
the token creation, the token sale, the distribution as well as the proceed allocation can be read in
chapter 5.

4.2 NAGA WALLET

The NAGA WALLET is the ideal multi-currency payment gateway, which allows to control numerous
forms of digital payments simultaneously. NAGA WALLET is the first fully-automated, user-friendly
wallet on the market. The benefits of NAGA WALLET is the high level of security. When it comes to
cryptos, security is what matters most. The NAGA WALLET ensures the highest possible level of
security thanks to its decentralised data storage. The wallet allows the seamless conversion of
Coins and NGC into EUR or USD. While we all love participating in interesting ICOs with amazing
business ideas, the process of signing up and purchasing tokens is often complicated and time
consuming. With the NAGA Wallet, investing in ICOs only takes one click. The NAGA WALLET being
an integral part of the NAGA Ecosystem, it seamlessly interacts with NAGA TRADER and the NAGA
CARD, offering a whole new level of investment opportunities across all asset classes.

NAGA Ecosystem. The web and later mobile application facilitates the storage of all major crypto-
currencies, the easy management of crypto portfolios, simple transfers of funds between peers,
and a multitude of other functionalities. Moreover, the wallet will be connected to the leading
crypto-exchanges and offer easy investing in selected initial coin offerings with one click.

Every crypto investor faces the same problem: opportunities to exchange digital tokens for goods
and services in our everyday lives are very limited. Buying goods and services with cryptocurrencies
should be as easy as buying with USD, EUR, or JPY.

THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER

35
To solve this problem, NAGA introduced the NAGA CARD, allowing users to spend their cryptocur-
rencies in millions of online and offline locations worldwide. In fact, everyone who purchased NGC
is already an early user of the NAGA WALLET. As it allows users to buy NGCs with BTC, ETH, LTC,
DASH or with Fiat currencies using their credit card or bank transfer, it is the first Proof of Concept.

4.3 BENEFITS OF NGC USAGE

The NAGA Coin serves as the base currency and decentralized unit of account for all parts of the
NAGA Ecosystem:

NAGA TRADER - The Social Network for Traders

CYBO - Robo-Advisory Service

Switex - The virtual goods Exchange

NAGA WALLET - The Multi-Asset Cryptocurrency Wallet
NAGA Academy - Online Trading University

The long-term value of NGC will reflect NGC’s adoption and its active user base. Early participants
who purchased NGC during the token pre-sale received the tokens at a steep discount, and they
will have the opportunity to participate from the start in NGC’s traction and growth.

Why does NAGA TRADER require the blockchain technology to become the leading platform to trade
financial markets?

1. The safest deposit and trading account in the world - The NAGA Coin totally eliminates
any counterparty risk against any bank or broker:

2. Your cryptocurrency is stored within your NAGA WALLET without anyone else but you
having access to it (no money/cryptocurrency is transferred to any third party).

3. Smart contracts determine available margin to trade.

4. Your profit & loss is simply being credited to / deducted from your account via trans-
parent and safe smart contracts.

THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER
5. To enable everyone to trade the financial markets without having to open a bank ac-
count or using a credit card company.

6. To cut out banks that add no value to the user.

Why does Switex require the blockchain technology to become the leading platform to trade virtual
goods?

Fraud and fake items as well as safety and security are the core problems of virtual good markets.
By signing all virtual goods with the blockchain, Switex ensures transparency and safety, as well as
a smart contract based distribution of revenues between gamers, publishers and affiliates. The
blockchain makes the entire Switex ecosystem transparent, efficient and prevents any kind of ma-
nipulation.

1. Any fraudulent or scam/hack activity is made almost impossible in a network of trust and
constant validity checks.

2. Transactions are secured by smart-contracts, encrypted and double verified with external
nodes.

Any “movement” of data is tracked and thus is reversible.
4. Enables the user to safely invest cryptocurrencies in virtual goods.

Gamers need a fast and secure way to invest and to get what they want, without the has-
sle of traditional payment methods and the need to involve banks/credit card companies.

6. User and transaction related data is stored anonymously and in a decentralized way.

7. Publishers and Switex know as much as you allow them to and other users can only see
your username — no account data is exposed to public.

Figure 23: Advantages NGC Usage

The NAGA Coin (NGC) is the backbone of NAGA and will grant its users many advantages and sim-
ultaneously incentivize its holders to use their NGC for every transaction within the NAGA Ecosys-
tem.

4.3.1 Usage as Base Currency

Token Holders will be able to use NGC as their base currency on NAGA’s platforms. This further
implies that token holders will be allowed to trade all kinds of financial instruments or virtual items,
using cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, the NAGA Academy will accept NGC, granting users special
benefits in comparison to “fiat users”.

THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER
4.3.2 Lower Trading Fees on NAGA TRADER on Every Asset Using a NGC Account

NGC users will pay 50% less on the trading commissions for each trade they perform on NAGA
TRADER. If, for example, the fee for an Apple Trade with 100 Apple shares would be $10 using an
USD account and the NGC/USD rate at the time is 1 NGC = $1, a NGC based account would only
need to pay 5 NGC in trading fees.

4.3.3 Cashback per Each Trade Performed on NAGA TRADER Using a NGC
Account

For each trade made (round-turn), the trader would receive - based on the formula below - a bonus

booked to the dedicated bonus wallet inside the NAGA WALLET. This also applies for trades made

with a CYBO connected to a NGC account, as well as all auto-copied trades.

Example: /f a user opens a trade and invests 100 USD then he/she should receive a percentage
of the invested amount as a cashback. The final number depends on the traded instrument, the
leverage of the trading instrument, and the trading volume. According to NAGA TRADER current
estimations, users can expect a cashback of 0.01% to 0.05% per trade based on the trading vol-
ume. The exact numbers are subject to NAGA TRADER Terms & Conditions and will be updated on
a regular basis.27

4.3.4 Double Crediting of Copy Bonuses on NAGA TRADER Using a NGC Account

If a user opens and shares trades on the NAGA TRADER platform using an NGC based account,
NAGA TRADER will credit a double bonus to the users bonus wallet inside the NAGA WALLET. If -
based on the formula below - a copy bonus would result in $2 and the NGC/USD rate at the mo-
ment would be 1 NGC = $1, NAGA TRADER would book 4 NGC to the user’s balance instead of $2.

The copy bonus is calculated when the user’s trade gets copied and opened on the copying users
Live Account and is further determined by the particular closing volume (round-turn). The bonus
amount depends on the traded volume in USD on Live accounts from other users. Whenever a user
gets copied, he receives a real-time push notification of how much Bonus he has made.

* Rate of USD to Live Account’s currency

Note: this calculation may be subject to change based on T&C

Explanation: This multiplier (2) means that NAGA TRADER pays a doubled bonus for a round-turn
rade.

Note: NAGA TRADER pays up to $50 in copy bonus per $1,000,000 traded volume. The actua
amount may vary between $10 and $50 and is subject to the decision of the company. The exact
numbers are subject to NAGA TRADER Terms & Conditions and will be updated on a regular basis.28

Based on NAGA TRADER historical data, traders have received an average of 0.81 EUR in copy
bonus per 1 trade which was copied by others (average value). The total amount of the monthly
copy bonus for NAGA TRADER will grow based on the number of newly acquired users and the
virality effect of the network. Exact numbers are subject to the adoption rate of NGC and can be
taken from the financial model available on the Token Sale website.

It is further planned that traders can charge NGC for sharing their trades. If a trader opens a trade,
he can decide if he wants to share the trade with the community and how much he wants to charge
in NGC for his trade. When a potential copier sees the trade, he can unlock the copy function and
copy the trade by paying in NGC for this information.

4.3.5 Lower Trading Fees on Switex on every asset using a NGC account

The Switex platforms plans to charge a 10% fee for each purchase on its platform. Using an NGC
account, token holders will only pay 9% of the equivalent fee.

4.3.6 Cashback Program Switex

In Switex, users who have exchanged their NGCs into Switex Coins will receive an extra bonus and,
thus, a better exchange rate in comparison to users who exchange their Fiat money to Switex coins.
NGC users will thus receive 5% more Switex Coins.

4.3.7 Discounted purchase of Ad Credits for the Switex and NAGA TRADER Ad
Manager

Visiting ad.switex.com and ad.nagatrader.com respectively, NAGA TRADER and Switex will accept
NGC as payment method for its Ad Credits. Based on the scheme below, it is planned to allow
marketers and advertisers, as well as users who want to gain more visibility on the platform, to
purchase more clicks and impressions on the Switex and NAGA TRADER platforms. Users are able
to target their traffic based on various attributes, such as country, platform, age, income level, and
placement inside the app.

4.3.8 Community Status and Access to Paid and Premium Content

Token Holders will get a more prominent status, so that their profiles are better ranked and more
visible than the profiles of others. Their trades will be ranked better and they will get access to
educational material, closed groups, and promotions activities that will be not disclosed to regular
Fiat money platform users.

Switex will offer token holders who successfully obtain an item on the platform a premium virtual
good which can only be used within Switex for unlocking premium content and receive access to
the newest games/new in-game-items. Furthermore, token holders will benefit from discounted
and/or free access to NAGA Academy courses and online degrees.

THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER
4.4 SMART CONTRACTS FOR BONUSES

All bonus calculations and transfers are handled by the NGC Bonus Smart Contract, which will be
published alongside the integration for NAGA TRADER and Switex respectively.

From all connected platforms, there will be a Smart Contract developed for the NAGA DONATION
FUND. From each transaction on NAGA TRADER, Switex and the NAGA WALLET, the smart contract
will take a percentage of the transaction volume, and allocate a portion of tokens to the NAGA
DONATION FUND.

4.5 THE NAGA DONATION FUND

The NAGA Donation FUND will be operated by NAGA and selected charity projects will be proposed
to the token holder community. In quarterly polls, all NGC holders will be eligible to decide which
charity projects will receive a donation. The projects will be assessed by a dedicated team and will
include NGOs only.

4.6 NAGA TOKEN PRICE VARIATIONS
It is important to understand that the price of NGC will vary over time, based on a number of factors,
which are outlined below:

e Organic growth of user demand,

e Speculative demand,

e USD/ETH exchange rate, and

e The cost of gas within the Ethereum network.

While NGC will fluctuate in value against fiat, BTC, and ETH, the listing fee will be regularly adjusted
to track $1. For example, if NGC are each worth $1, then 1 NGC will be needed to reflect the value
of $1. NGC tokens can be purchased directly within the app, or from other NGC holders on external
markets (cryptocurrency exchanges, OTC, etc.).

Once NGCs have been used within the NAGA Ecosystem, these tokens will be continuously recircu-
lated into the market by selling them on exchanges.

Recirculating NGC tokens at market price helps to engage the user community. As NGC grows in
popularity, and more users join the platform, higher revenues will allow the completion and release
of new features that are already in development. This will further increase the appeal of the plat-
form and lead to higher transaction volumes within the NAGA Ecosystem.

5. TOOLS FOR NETWORK GROWTH

5.1 A SUSTAINABLE CRYPTO ECONOMY

For a cryptocurrency to be successful over time it must become the driver for a sustainable econ-
omy. As NGC is utilised by more users and adopted by more providers, the network effect of the
NAGA ecosystem and its platforms will grow, building the value of the ecosystem for the benefit of
long time holders and token sale participants. A successful economy requires NGC to have growing
demand within the NAGA network. The core focus of the public listed NAGA AG is the acquisition of
deposits and growth of users for NAGA TRADER, Switex and the NAGA Wallet. As NGC is the future
currency of choice for these platforms, the NGC is backed and additional NGC demand is acceler-
ated and generated by the multi-hundred-million publicly listed NAGA Group AG.

Why the NAGA-Crypto-Economy will work:

Like every economy the NAGA crypto universe is determined by supply and demand. The core busi-
ness model of the NAGA Group is to grow their platforms and user base by generating deposits (or
subscriptions in the case of NAGA Academy). The success of the acquisition of deposits/subscrip-
tions (demand generation) depends on the ratio between customer acquisition cost (CAC) and cus-
tomer life time value (LTV). The main monetary policy measure in the NAGA crypto-economy is
hence the efficiency and budget for generating users and deposits.

Existing market measures of The NAGA AG:

Based on historic numbers, the current CAC to LTV ratio is around 1:5+ (CAC vs. LTV). The NAGA
Group AG with its additional traditional access to the capital markets and investors is aiming to
further increase the marketing focus and enhance the CAC vs. LTV ratio. An additional marketing
budget will be generated by the proceeds of this ITS. NGC will be lent or paid to third parties such
as The NAGA Group AG to carry out marketing activities and to generate more users and deposits.
Marketing will be carried out via viral growth as well as organic growth (acquisitions). This will result
in higher deposits, NAGA Academy subscriptions, revenues, demand and hence a higher NGC price.

The user centric benefit and bonus system as well as the engaging and social user experience of
the NAGA platforms further generate organic and viral growth. Furthermore, the re-investment of
profits generated on the platforms will fuel the marketing activities and hence grow deposits and
thus demand for NGC (it is crucial to understand that the supply of NGC is limited, therefore the
demand for NGC, however, is not limited). Furthermore, the NGC utility token has a broad and di-
versified use case fundament that ranges from financial trading via in-game-item-trading, to pur-
chasing multiple benefits, including online education. Since participation in the NAGA Ecosystem
requires users to acquire NGC, demand for the token will grow in proportion to the number of active
users and the number of transactions they execute.

The ITS proceeds will further allow the network to grow in proportion to the number of active NAGA
application users who are acquired via a diversified portfolio of marketing channels, incl. cross-
platform selling and potential M&A transactions. Buyers of NGC are incentivised to hold significant
reserves of NGC in order to participate in the growth of the NAGA eco-system. Aside from spending
NGC, the model also provides a means of earning NGC rewards for activity on the platforms.

THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER
Necessity for a decentralized and democratic solution in the financial trading and in-game-item
space:

Switex requires virtual goods to be based on blockchain to:

a) Guarantee authenticity of items,

b) Prevent fraud,

c) Make transactions transparent,

d) Make transactions traceable,

e) Prevent abuse and money laundering,

f) Allow partners within the ecosystem (publishers, affiliate partners etc.) to participate in the
value chain and have a transparent way that allows such partners to have an “embedded
live audit” with regards to any receivables.

In the eyes of NAGA, the crowd/communhity and not a central institution needs to have control over
the ecosystem and its full transparency and safety - as a natural evolutionary process within this
industry. Most of these attributes will apply to NAGA TRADER and the NAGA WALLET as well (pub-
lishers are brokers, banks, financial institutions within this context). NAGA believes that trading in
the financial space will naturally evolve into the blockchain space and that financial transactions
will governed by smart contracts.

The NAGA ITS built the foundation for NAGA and the NGC to play an important role and to secure a
seat in the front row of this development. Furthermore, NAGA believes that such crucial functions
should not be owned/governed by a centralised company but rather the token holders.

5.1.1 Fully Barrier Free Entry

In order to allow simple access to every user, both NAGA TRADER and Switex offer a proven virtual
trading mode. Clients can access and try out the platforms in a risk and hassle-free environment.
Furthermore, the platforms and its Joint Venture partners, financial institutions, brokers, as well as
providers are able to provide welcome credits as an incentive to join the platform. These mecha-
nisms have proven to be very efficient in attracting masses of users and traffic and have historically
lead to the purchase of NGC (opening “live accounts”) in up to more of 50% of all registered users.
Within NAGA’s decentralised universe,

Ever since the inception of Bitcoin, and throughout the entire history of cryptocurrency, one of the
major barriers to entry for curious individuals has always been converting FIAT directly into Bitcoin
and other cryptocurrencies. The process usually requires some degree of technical skill and
knowledge, an understanding of security, and trust in a system which is unlike anything these peo-
ple have previously used. There’s no phone call to a broker to make a trade, there’s no speaking
with an advisor in an office, and of course there are ways of being swindled.

Currently, the process of buying cryptocurrencies is a tremendous multi-step hassle. Generally
speaking, it begins with trying to figure out how to buy Bitcoin from various platforms (e.g. Bitcoin
ATM, website, cash-deal), sending it to an exchange (e.g. Bittrex, Poloniex) and then figuring out
how to make a trade for the desired cryptocurrency. These multiple steps can seem complex, in-
timidating, and incomprehensible in some cases. Even for experienced investors with technical

THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER

47
knowledge, the process of converting FIAT into digital currencies is generally slow, limited, frustrat-
ing, and occasionally risky. Due to these inconveniences, NAGA believes that curious and qualified
investors are still turning their backs on the crypto-markets and are consequently missing opportu-
nities they would have otherwise seized.

5.1.2 Transparency and Trust

NAGA’s crypto wallet is secured by applying the highest industry standards. NAGA works together
with a leading wallet security provider in the industry to ensure the safety of funds. The funds are
also secured by a combination of hot and cold storage solutions, which provide further security.
The ID of the multi-asset wallet is the user's e-mail address and/or phone number. User registration
automatically creates a blockchain wallet. Access to the user’s wallet is locked by a 6-digit pin-code
and any transfers out from your wallet ARE also secured by a 2 Factor Authentication (2FA) to pro-
vide an additional layer of security.

NAGA’s number one priority is to provide an open and completely transparent process when getting
this platform established, so that everyone can understand and appreciate the potential that this
system will have. For this project to succeed, the diversity of currencies is going to be key, hence
the large ITS amount. NAGA wants to create a strong and lasting relationship with its customers by
providing responsive and helpful customer service, complete transparency, comprehensive secu-
rity, and the levels of anonymity that they desire. To accomplish all this, NAGA needs to have a
thorough referral program that is going to encourage users to report all bugs and any security issues
that may be present. Due to a strong desire to put forth the best system possible, NAGA still con-
siders the possibility of adding more members to its team to cover areas like crypto security experts
and the hiring of an outside auditor.

5.1.3 Liquidity and Volatility

Unlike any other ITS, the NGC is used within two eco-systems (Switex and NAGA TRADER as well as
future use-cases such as NAGA Academy) out of which NAGA TRADER is already live and generating
billions of Euros in trading volume every month. In addition to those concrete use-cases NGC is
listed at several Crypto-Exchanges, such as OKEX and HitBTC, with further listings expected. The
details and exact dates will be communicated.

NAGA has already managed to generate a thick and deep market with NAGA TRADER and intends
to further enhance these characteristics following its path of exponential growth. As NAGA has al-
ready established a functioning network for real money transactions, the liquidity risk is being mit-
igated from day one by running a “real money platform” in parallel that is linked and connected to
the NGC. Furthermore, NAGA holds licenses as an EU-regulated financial institution (NAGA Markets
Ltd.) that allows NAGA to act as a market maker and liquidity provider. Unlike any other ITS provider
or token issuer, NAGA Markets has a team of 20+ highly skilled and regulated employees with a
vast background of experience to facilitate such services as a market maker and liquidity provider
in a regulated and fair environment. The procedures that are currently followed by NAGA Markets
are in accordance with the MIFID guidelines2° to ensure a safe, stable and fair operation of all
services carried out.

29 https://www.esma.europa.eu/policy-rules/mifid-ii-and-mifir

THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER
In addition to an already achieved critical mass to operate the platform NAGA TRADER, the linkage
to the ECR-20 protocol provides exchangeability within the largest crypto exchanges and hence
ensures sufficient and deep liquidity which naturally leads to lower volatility. The liquidity should
furthermore naturally become deeper with Switex which in addition to the above mentioned primary
market adds an additional pool of liquidity with the introduction of the Switex peer-to-peer second-
ary market. The ability to have access to an EU financial markets regulated market maker and
liquidity provider, as well as the backbone of high volume trades worth billions per month and two
use-cases, clearly differentiate the NAGA Token from most ITSs that have ever been performed.

In addition to these factors to mitigate liquidity and volatility risk the usual procedures offered by
all other token generators, such as using the ECR20 protocol and having the token listed on all
major crypto-exchanges contribute to the portfolio of simultaneous risk mitigation strategies.

5.1.4 NGC Monetary Policies

NAGA will use smart contracts to limit the lifetime of certain bonus tokens or tokens held with
specific partners, users, market makers, publishers or providers. This self-devaluation as well as
NAGA’s ability to determine such self-devaluation intervals will allow NAGA to subsidise, promote
and fuel certain services (or make non-beneficiary areas for the ecosystem less attractive), prod-
ucts or campaigns (i.e. "Welcome Deposit Bonus", "Copy Bonus" or "Referral Bonus").

The limitation of lifetime is achieved by re-allocating such NGC tokens into the i.e. Donation Fund.
By limiting the lifetime of the holders of such tokens they are highly incentivised to then immediately
use such tokens for the desired transaction and service. Hoarding tokens (which is unattractive
and undesirable to every economy) becomes less attractive or impossible. NAGA aims to further
grow and stabilise its ecosystems by implementing such "smart contract based monetary policies"
("SCBMP"), primarily applied by setting devaluation intervals and restricting the use of tokens for
specific services or to specific holders only). Changes of SCBMP can lead to tokens being used to
fuel the ecosystem in the desired areas and grow it. SCBMP also has a high impact on liquidity,
volatility, and spreads. SCBMP is an active steering and controlling tool that can subsidise certain
areas of the ecosystem such as virality, growth, trading volume, referrals, bonuses etc.

Whoever wants to use NAGA TRADER or Switex (or the NAGA Academy) will need to buy NGC. Hence,
there should be a naturally increasing demand. Even though there is still the fiat-platform world,
the NGC user benefits from various advantages, first and foremost from participating in a decen-
tralised, safe, democratic, transparent and safe blockchain-based economy. NAGA has proven to
be able to consistently raise client’s deposits, which will soon be raised in NGC primarily or in Fiat
which NAGA then will convert into NGC. NAGA will try to convert “Fiat users” into NGC users over
time.

But like every economy, the NGC crypto economy requires an adjustment mechanism. This task is
being performed by a discretionary Monetary Reserve pool. It is based on all NGC held by NAGA,
plus a certain percentage of the generated revenues.

The discretionary Monetary Reserve Pool can be used to:

1. Ensure sufficient NGC liquidity.
2. Create a market uplift (by buying or holding NGC).

THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER
3. Prevent an overheated market (by selling NGC).

The instruments are for example the following:

1. Token buy-back programs (i.e. by using ITS proceeds).
2. SCBMP (see above - by limiting the lifetime of i.e. bonus tokens).

3. Market Repurchase Buy Back - i.e. buying back NGC with a premium to the current market
rate.

4. Giving loans to user run market makers (See chapter peer2peer Trading Platform) - and
letting them register as market makers. This increases liquidity, increases competition, and
hence reduces spreads (by creating numerous decentralised user run liquidity providers).

5. Install a dynamic exchange rate multiplier (NAGA reserves the right to introduce an addi-
tional sub NAGA TRADER /Switex coin in the event of extreme volatility with a dynamic ex-
change rate multiplier in order to provide a stable base currency for its platform. The utility
benefits of the NGC remain unchanged for the user).

5.2 PERENNIAL PLATFORM GROWTH

Being traded and used on several internal as well as external marketplaces, platforms and ecosys-
tems carries a risk of high volatility, including inter-platform arbitrage. Both carry significant risk as
well, as the opportunity to trade the NGC for price difference only. Subscribers should be aware of
market risk as well as liquidity risk. Although NAGA intends to use the majority of the proceeds of
the ITS for driving volume and traffic to the platform, there is no guarantee of the sufficient (or any)
liquidity of the NGC.

One of the most crucial user benefits and embedded functions for viral platform growth is the Fol-
lower Bonus paid in NGC. Users can monetise their skills and earn NGC by posting attractive trades
or strategies on NAGA TRADER and get paid per follower or auto-copier. Users can hence earn NGC
by generating their own community of followers. This feature has also proven to increase the virality
of the platform. The user’s incentive to generate passive and steady income from followers if they
constantly post and share sustainable trades and strategies generates visibility even beyond the
borders of the NAGA TRADER Ecosystem. NAGA TRADER currently supports sharing functions into
the largest (social) networks worldwide (i.e. Facebook, WhatsApp). The niche of a “Facebook for
Finance” has yet to be taken on and NAGA TRADER currently boasts a vast variety of features that
can usually only be found in major networks such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram or What's app.
These features will also be integral parts of the NAGA Cryptocurrency trading and investing services.

By combining these features with a highly latency optimised real time data infrastructure connect-
ing the largest trading exchanges, NAGA TRADER has an optimal foundation to grow both by intrin-
sic user activity (triggered by sharing motivated through follower/auto-copier bonuses) and exter-
nally by investments in marketing or acquisitions (with its IPO The NAGA Group AG has created an
acquisition currency (the NAGA Group AG share).

The follower-bonus on NAGA TRADER hence generates a concrete incentive - credited in real time
to the user’s wallet- for the individual user at the same time as being the engine for exponential
and viral growth of the community. Unlike conventional asset management or advisory services
that are usually centralised in their nature, the NAGA TRADER Ecoystem allows every user to publish
his trade or strategy and get paid in NGC per follower and per copied trade. In addition to human

THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER
users following and generating passive income, NAGA TRADER algorithm based “CYBO” also trig-
gers bonuses for users if and when CYBO follows and copies a user.

NAGA TRADER has successfully implemented this proven leader/follower system in 2016 with hun-
dreds of millions of USD in volume traded every month and this system already generates thou-
sands of EUR for users from more than 100 different countries. Single users have made more than
10,000 EUR in copy bonus per month and are already managing funds exceeding 1m EUR. By
bringing the leader-follower logic to the world of crypto currencies and smart contracts, NAGA
TRADER is opening an additional segment to grow its community. It allows users to build their sub-
communities and to foster and grow them by allowing users to directly connect and use the in-app
real time chat and messaging features as well as scoring and rating services (NAGA Guard). The
NAGA Token based follower/leader system is a core component of the NAGA TRADER Ecosystem
and enables the platform users to make their participation in this crypto economy a factual income
generating profession.

6.2 ROADMAP
The further Development of the NAGA Platform consists of three tracks:

e Technology development
e Legal and licensing development

e Community and business development

The technology development track is dedicated to creating not only the smart contracts for NGC
and its ecosystem, but also all the necessary infrastructure for fund administration, reporting, anal-
ysis, and integration with publishers, banks and brokers. Thanks to the extensive experience of the
NAGA team in the development of trading platforms and the setting up of API connections with
lending companies, these tasks rest on a solid foundation of expertise and successful track record.

On the legal and licensing track, NAGA legal and executive teams will focus their efforts on setting
up a fully transparent, licensed where necessary, and auditable structure, making sure that the
envisioned structure is fully compliant with regulations. To do this, NAGA will perform in-house re-
search as well as contract with reputable legal firms.

On the community and business development track, NAGA will continue its aggressive expansion
strategy, sign new partnerships and build a strong international brand. Partnerships with leading
online marketing agencies and consulting companies will accelerate NAGA’s future expansion
plans.

The funds collected in the token sale are used to meet predefined milestones in NAGA’s product
roadmap as outlined below. The mentioned dates are the earliest dates possible. The milestones
provide today’s view of the market needs. Due to the fast-evolving nature of the blockchain ecosys-
tem these milestones are indicative. NAGA commits to these milestones regardless of the outcome

THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER
of the token sales and total funds collected. As NAGA is already publicly listed and has a running
business with an EU licensed brokerage, billions of $ in traded volume every month, and several
offices around Europe, NAGA intends to use the proceeds mainly to expand the ecosystem, acquire
millions of users, and build a powerful engine for NGC holders. Besides Marketing, Business Devel-
opment and diligent work on Legal & Regulatory, NAGA foresees the following roadmap on the
product side:

NAGA MARKET GUARD

Looking at websites, such as coinmarketcap.com, which have 80 to 100 million users, to analyse
the momentum of specific coins, there is clearly high demand for detailed learning about the spec-
ifications around the various tokens which are being issued nearly every day. NAGA believes that
crypto Investors need a place to learn about tokens in-depth, instead of solely looking at the market
cap or traded volume.

Together with its partner Finery, who helped NAGA TRADER with the development of its crowd &
market-intelligence based robo-advisor “CYBO”, NAGA is already working on a sophisticated solu-
tion which allows users to evaluate a special risk score around tokens on the market, called NAGA
Market Guard. NAGA thinks that there is too much scam around tokens, currencies and exchanges
in general. Thus, NAGA partially sees itself on a social mission for its users to save them from
supicious players in the market.

With NAGA Market Guard, NAGA will use advanced machine learning and data mining techniques
and benefit from deep expertise in market microstructure in order to realise investment opportuni-
ties for retail clients, B2B algorithmic-traders, and brokers. With a normalised real-time market data
feed from a number of venues, plus risk indicators, there are three core products NAGA wants to
offer if the minimum funding goal of USD 50,000,000 is reached:

cess to real-time market data worldwide, NAGA believes it will be able to offer a complete ecosys-
tem from market research through to direct execution.

THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER
NAGA plans to develop and build a fully regulated and holistic exchange that allows its users to
invest fiat, crypto currencies, as well as gaming items, into any virtual asset offered in the ecosys-
tem. Given the fact that NAGA has a track record, its own payment gateway and conversion service
connected to multicurrency wallet, as well as an EU-regulated brokerage that can serve over 100
countries in the world and already running platforms, the vision is to have a one-stop solution for
investors of any liquid asset class globally - The NAGA Exchange. Moreover, NAGA plans the launch
of peer-to-peer liquidity project in 2019, embodying the creation of a decentralised and democratic
market maker and liquidity system.

7. TRANSPARENCY, REGULATORY & RISK FACTORS

7.1 TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY

NAGA’s group activities comprise of a large set of activities that may be subject to regulatory scru-
tiny in various territories. The NAGA entities already operate in a highly regulated environment. The
holding company The NAGA Group AG as a public company listed at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange
is subject to all transparency and market abuse regulations according to European legislation. The
groups brokerage company NAGA Markets Ltd. is licensed as a financial services provider under
supervision of the Cyprus security and exchange commission.

This implies that not only the companies’ operations, namely its dealings with client funds but as
well its personnel with respect to running a financial services institution are under constant super-
vision and control. Although the regulatory environment for companies and groups operating with
tokens and cryptocurrencies of its customers is not yet clearly defined, the fact that the NAGA Group
already has to comply with various compliance, transparency as well as regulatory rules, provides
the groups customers as well as participants of the token sale with the most secure environment
so far available for token generating events or initial coin offerings.

The legal structure set up for the token sale has been and will be constantly reviewed and approved
by the groups legal advisors to ensure that they are compliant with the existing laws and regula-
tions. As far as the group or its advisors will encounter legal uncertainties, these will be resolved
with the responsible regulatory bodies involved. By sorting out any legal or regulatory exposures
from the very beginning, the group is aiming for full transparency towards investors as well as reg-
ulators in order to achieve the highest level of investor confidence as well as legal and regulatory
compliance possible.

7.2 REPORTING

NAGA will provide a reporting structure that gives the token holders full transparency on what has
been achieved with the proceeds from the ITS as well as the use of the tokens and the status of
the projects. NAGA Development Association Ltd. will provide the token holders with an annual
reporting on:

Balance and assets

e Crypto currencies held
e Fiat money held

Use of the Token Sale proceeds

e Platform development progress

e Marketing

e General expenses

e Other costs according to financial forecast

7.3 RISK FACTORS

The purchase of tokens involves a high degree of risk, including but not limited to the risks de-
scribed below. Before acquiring NGC tokens, it is recommended that each participant carefully
weighs all the information and risks detailed in this White Paper, and, specifically, the following risk
factors. Please further note that the NAGA project may be subject to other risks not foreseen.

7.3.1 Dependence on Computer Infrastructure

NAGA’s dependence on functioning software applications, computer hardware, and the Internet
implies that NAGA can offer no assurances that a system failure would not adversely affect the use
of your NGC tokens. Despite NAGA's implementation of all reasonable network security measures,
its processing centre servers are vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins
or other disruptions of a similar nature. Computer viruses, break-ins or other disruptions caused
by third parties may result in interruption, delay or suspension of services, which would limit the
use of the ITSs tokens.

7.3.2 Smart Contract Limitations

Smart contract technology is still in its early stages of development, and its application is of an
experimental nature. This may carry significant operational, technological, regulatory, reputation
and financial risks. Consequently, although the audit conducted by an independent third party in-
creases the level of security, reliability, and accuracy, this audit cannot serve as any form of war-
ranty, including any expressed or implied warranty that the ITSS Smart Contract is fit for purpose
or that it contains no flaws, vulnerabilities or issues which could cause technical problems or the
complete loss of ITSS tokens.

7.3.3 Regulatory Risks

Blockchain technology, including but not limited to the issue of tokens, may be a new concept in
some jurisdictions, which may then apply existing laws or introduce new regulations regarding
Blockchain technology-based applications, and such regulations may conflict with the current smart
contract setup and token concept. This may result in the need to make substantial modifications
to NAGA’s smart contract, including but not limited to its termination, the loss of NGS tokens, and
the suspension or termination of all NGC token functions.

It cannot be ruled out that services and projects described in this document will have to be adjusted
or modified in certain countries, because of the regulatory environment. It also cannot be ruled out,
that some services will be impossible to provide in certain jurisdictions.

THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER

60
7.3.4 Taxes

NGC token holders may be required to pay taxes associated with the transactions contemplated
herein. It will be a sole responsibility of NGC token holders to comply with the tax laws of the juris-
dictions applicable to them and pay all relevant taxes.

7.3.5 Force Majeure

NAGA’s performance may be interrupted, suspended or delayed due to force majeure circum-
stances. For the purposes of this White Paper, force majeure shall mean extraordinary events and
circumstances which could not be prevented by NAGA and shall include acts of nature, wars, armed
conflicts, mass civil disorders, industrial actions, epidemics, lockouts, slowdowns, prolonged short-
age or other failures of energy supplies or communication service, acts of municipal, state or fed-
eral governmental agencies, other circumstances beyond NAGA's control, which were not in exist-
ence at the time of White Paper release.

If such circumstances occur prior to the issue of NGC tokens and NAGA is unable to issue NGC
tokens within one month from the projected date, the escrow agent may issue a refund at the
request of the NGC token purchasers. The refund will be issued in the original form of payment to
the same digital wallet or bank account where the funds were transferred from.

7.3.6 Disclosure of Information

Personal information received from NGC token holders, the information about the number of tokens
owned, the wallet addresses used, and any other relevant information may be disclosed to law
enforcement, government officials, and other third parties when NAGA is required to disclose such
information by law, subpoena, or court order. NAGA shall at no time be held responsible for such
information disclosure.

7.3.7 Value of NGC Token

Once purchased, the value of NGC token may significantly fluctuate due to various reasons. NAGA
does not guarantee any specific value of the NGC token over any specific period of time. NAGA shall
not be held responsible for any change in the value of NGC token including the complete loss of
value of the NGC. Even though the large scale and large magnitude use cases (with a proof of
concept in billions of Euros already traded every month on NAGA TRADER) implies deep liquidity
and hence also lower volatility, there is no guarantee that NAGA will achieve those goals.

There is no guarantee that users can acquire sufficient NAGA Tokens for their usage within the
NAGA and external platforms and neither is there a guarantee that users can cash out their NAGA
Tokens via external platforms. Furthermore, every NAGA Token holder naturally carries the risk of
volatile exchange rate fluctuations of the NAGA Token towards both other Crypto Currencies and
Fiat Money exchange rates.

7.3.8 Bitcoin and Ethereum Volatility

The NGC token may be significantly influenced by digital currency market trends and NGC value
may be severely depreciated due to non-NGC related events in the digital currency markets. Cryp-
tocurrencies exchange rate volatility may impact the company's ability to provide services at the
indicated prices. Assumptions with respect to the foregoing involve, among other things, judgments
about the future economic, competitive and market conditions and business decisions, most of

THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER

61
which are beyond the control of the NAGA team and are therefore difficult or impossible to accu-
rately predict.

7.3.9 Lack of funds from ITS proceeds

NAGA may not reach the target sale amount and may not have sufficient funds to execute its busi-
ness plan. Furthermore, NAGA may not succeed in creating the necessary momentum and ac-
ceptance for the NGC token which may result in low liquidity and depletion of trades. The positions
and plans outlined in this white paper may be altered as the project progresses.

7.3.10 Delayed Projects & Competition

Although the NAGA team believes that its assumptions underlying its forward-looking statements
are reasonable, any of these may prove to be inaccurate. As a result, the NAGA team can offer no
assurances that the forward-looking statements contained in this White Paper will prove to be ac-
curate.

In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements contained herein,
the inclusion of such information may not be interpreted as a warranty on the part of NAGA or any
other entity that the objectives and plans of the NAGA project will be successfully achieved. Com-
petition may introduce the same or better prediction market solutions and cause NAGA to lose
market share and eventually fail to deliver on its business goals.

ANNEX 1 - FINTECH INDUSTRY OUTLOOK

The FinTech industry has gained an increasing importance and economic significance in the last
few years. The profit of8° investments of global FinTech companies in 2015 increased by around
75% compared to 2014.31 In 2015 alone, investments in this sector increased by 22.3 billion USD
in comparison to the previous year. The Federal Ministry of Finance estimates that there are cur-
rently around 346 FinTech companies in Germany alone. Based on historical and expected industry
growth rates (between 2017-2021), the average annual growth rate for the FinTech industry in
Germany, is estimated to constitute 9%, based on the transaction value.32 According to the auditing
company KPMG and CB insights, Germany is the largest FinTech region in Europe.33 Among the
strongest driving forces of the sector are the topics Blockchain, Robo-Advisory, Insurtech and Digital
Payments.

climate for FinTech is considered to be positive.263? The third quarter of 2016, represented the
height of the global "VC" investments (Venture Capital) in the FinTech industry, with total invest-
ments amounting to USD 2.9 billion.38

As of 2017, experts predict that China and the United States will be the future key markets for the
FinTech industry. The highest forecast of transaction volume for sale or IPO of companies in this
industry amounts to 1,086,492.5 million USD -for China alone. The US, in comparison, with a fore-
casted transaction value of 1,025,519 million USD, is ranked 24,39 With an immense distance and
a transaction value of 145,105 million USD, Japan ranks 34,

Established DAX companies like Deutsche Bank AG4°.42 and Commerzbank AG are also investing
more and more in these or similar technologies. The interest of those companies underlines the
current trend and the fact that especially the so-called millennials, (i.e., the population born be-
tween 1980 and 1999) have a strong affinity to new technologies, and have a rising interest in the
services and products that the FinTech industry offers. Thus, this interest group also acts as a major
growth driver for the FinTech industry as a whole.424344

Considering the constant increase in the number of users for the leading Social Trading and Gaming
apps, the market prospects from the point of view of the issuer are very good and long-lasting. The
customer group between the age of 18 and 35 does not feel addressed by the “classic offer” from
brokers, although they belong to the most important target audience of the Social Trading market.
This target group shows clear preferences for modern solutions.*5 46 A modern and technologically
sophisticated solution (i.e., an App) has the potential to achieve more in a shorter period of time,
which is also reflected in the growth figures and reviews of comparable companies in the industry.
In addition, it is also worth underlining the increased requirements for financial services here and
the increasing preference for digital solutions, specifically in the prosperous middle class, who are

Robo-Advisory

Robo-advisors are automated software asset managers, which, on the basis of ready-made strate-
gies, offer automated investments of customer funds. These robo-advisors build portfolios out of
mostly index funds (ETFs). These portfolios usually contain common asset classes such as stocks,
bonds and occasionally also commodities.51 In comparison to conventional portfolio management
solutions, such as managed funds, robo-advisory strategies primarily are characterised as lower
cost structures. In addition, this type of automated system is particularly attractive for younger and
technology-oriented users.52

predicted that by the year 2020, robo-advisors will manage around 10% of all global assets. It is
expected that by 2021, robo-advisory managed assets will rise to around 1,063,844 million USD.53

Gaming Market

The total annual development of turnover in this industry shows an average growth rate of 7% per
year. This means that by 2019, the gaming market will achieve a total forecasted turnover of 118.6
billion USD.54 In 2016, the top 25 public gaming companies showed an additional 22% growth in
sales in comparison to the previous year. When considering the mobile market, growth rates be-
tween 2015 and 2016 actually amounted to 40%. This indicates how Sony, for example, managed
to increase sales by 45% in the same period. Tencent, by far the biggest gaming group, reported a
record turnover of USD 5.3 billion in 2016.55 The most rapid growing market segment in the gaming
area is the "Free to Play" genre (games are provided to the user free of charge, and additional
content can be purchased such as in-game items), Virtual Reality, and of course, the mobile sector.
The latter, according to a forecast from 2017, is surpassing the classic computer game sector by
4 billion USD. In the "Free to Play" genre alone, the games League of Legends and DOTA 2 gener-
ated total monthly sales of over 173 million USD.

Considering the described development of the gaming industry, there is a clear trend in the gam-
ing market towards the sale of in-game Items within the free-to-play games. In comparison to the
classic "Pay to play"-model (i.e. the game that you pay for) the annual and total worldwide sales of
the "Free to Play" models is at least four times higher. It’s a clearly recognised trend to provide
the user with a “Free to Play” game and to then encourage them through "Micro Transactions"
(the purchase of in-game items individually for small amounts) to individualise and customise
their gaming experience.

ANNEX 2 - INTERNET, BLOCKCHAIN & CRYPTOCURRENCIES

Without doubt, the internet has revolutionised how humans live, communicate, think, and how they
live their everyday lives. It has turned their very existence upside down. Today, most humans take
the internet for granted and cannot even imagine their lives without it. The internet was born nearly
five decades ago, and since then, technology has rapidly advanced by huge leaps. About 15 years
ago, only 12% of all people owned mobile phones. Now, more than six out of ten persons worldwide
use a mobile phone. About 15 years ago, one third of the population in developing countries lived
in extreme poverty, compared to less than 15% today. Facebook, which now has nearly 1.5 billion
users, had not even been launched then. In another fifteen years' time, who knows how much
technological innovation and developments society will see, and what changes this will bring?

Cryptocurrencies offer a fundamentally different way of approaching money and conducting online
commerce. The development of blockchain-based money solves a number of problems inherent in
the current financial system. A properly implemented online trading platform with integrated cryp-
tocurrency payments has extensive advantages.

Bitcoin

The first cryptocurrency was the bitcoin. Articulated in Satoshi Nakamoto's 2008 white paper,
Bitcoin deals with the «double spending» problem through the use of a shared ledger that is main-
tained by a large number of network nodes. By contriving a system in which it is computationally
expensive to add a block of transactions to the ledger, but easy for anyone to verify it, Bitcoin makes
it unlikely for any member of the network to succeed in submitting a fraudulent transaction - and
it is expensive to try to do so. Thus miners - those tasked with upholding the security of the network
- are better off acting honestly and maintaining the integrity of the ledger.

Financial independence

Nakamoto's implementation of his white paper effectively removed the need for a trusted third
party to act as a middleman in online transfers. This enabled real peer-to-peer transactions online
for the first time ever: a remarkable breakthrough, and a task that many experts had believed could
not be achieved. Money, which had been centralised for millennia in seigniorage, and for decades
in terms of the payment system, could once again become purely a tool of commerce rather than
a way to extract value and exert control. Because Bitcoin transactions take place directly - from
sender to recipient, and without the involvement of a centralised third party - they cannot be cen-
sored. Once a transaction has been accepted into the ledger, there is no way of reversing it. This
has a simple but powerful implication: if you want to send someone money, you can. There is no
authority that can block or reverse the transfer. Bitcoin's financial system restores full autonomy to
its users.

Low-cost transfers

Because Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies use a blockchain to secure transactions, there are no
middlemen to keep accounts, and therefore, there are no single entities that can charge fees for
the service. Miners collectively process transactions and are rewarded for verifying a block with
both new coins (block rewards, currently set at 12.5 Bitcoins per block) and the smaller fees in-
curred with each transfer. Unlike the legacy banking system, Bitcoin does not recognise geograph-
ical borders. Transferring funds to a neighbour on the other side of the road is as fast and efficient
as sending money to the other side of the world. While banks and remittance services tend to

THE NAGA COIN | WHITE PAPER

71
charge significant flat fees as well as unfavourable exchange rates between currencies, Bitcoin's
fees are fixed and low by comparison. Other blockchain protocols tend to charge even lower fees.

Privacy

Bitcoin's use of a shared ledger to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions also has implications for pri-
vacy. The Bitcoin ledger is fully transparent by design, meaning that anyone can trace transactions
from one address to another, right back to the block in which the coins were first created. However,
because addresses are essentially strings of random alphanumeric characters, it is not inherently
obvious to whom the address belongs. Bitcoin is, strictly speaking, pseudonymous rather than
anonymous. While data may be leaked in a variety of ways that associate a Bitcoin address with
other personal information to reveal the owner's identity, by using best practice it is possible to use
Bitcoin privately. The lack of a trusted intermediary means that no information need to be registered
to use a Bitcoin wallet. There is no administrative authority to control transactions or to collect user
data.

Initial Token Sale (ITS): a disruptive fundraising model.

Since of the year 2017, the world has witnessed an explosion of initial coin offerings (ICOs) as an
innovative and unique method of financing for startups globally. ICOs are a completely new and
game changing funding method done by issuing a corporate related token. This rise has challenged
the conventional venture capital industry in its capacity to finance innovative startups and projects.
ICOs have increased in popularity with over $2 billion raised since the beginning of 2017. The
amount raised by startups through ICOs has even surpassed venture capital (VC) funding in the
blockchain area in the first 2 quarters of 201757. ICOs raised nearly $1.3 billion in Q3 2017 alone
vs. just around $259 million for early stage VC funding®58. Companies have raised at least $2.6
billion this year via initial coin offerings (as per October 2017). ICOs have already surpassed all
historical VC investment in the blockchain space, which stands at $1.7B since 2010. Contrary to
conventional equity funding, ICOs give specific rights to their holders to use or profit from specific
company related services.

Figure 32: ICO Funding vs. VC Industry

Startups specialised in Blockchain technology or cryptocurrencies, are no longer the only ones to
use ICOs for their funding. This trend is accelerating spectacularly, with funds raised from ICOs
breaking new records on a monthly basis. The appeal of cryptocurrencies for investors is due to the
flexibility and the potential of solid returns that have been been witnessed lately on the market.
According to coinschedule.com5? there were 46 ICOs in 2016 and around 202 this year (as per
Oct.23)®°. The potentially disruptive funding model of the ICOs give companies the capacity to raise
money from individuals more efficiently. However, and if we take into consideration the increasing
exposure that ICOs have been gaining lately, the amount of funding generated is expected to keep
increasing dramatically in the coming months.

Ethereum

Launched in 2015, Ethereum is a decentralised software platform that enables Smart Contracts
and Distributed Applications (D-Apps) to be built and run without any downtime, fraud, control or
interference from a third party. Ethereum is not just a platform but also a programming language
(Turing complete) running on a blockchain, helping developers to build and publish distributed ap-
plications. The potential applications of Ethereum are wide ranging.

Dash

Dash was launched in January 2014 as Xcoin, and then changed its name to Darkcoin. In March
2015, Darkcoin was rebranded as Dash. Dash was created as a fork of Bitcoin, which means it
duplicated Bitcoin’s existent code and made it better by addressing the issues users faced with
Bitcoin. So apparent flaws and weaknesses in Bitcoin are absent in Dash, making both digital coins

73
substantially different in terms of efficiency. As an alternative to Bitcoin, Dash provides a faster and
more anonymous service to its users.

Litecoin

Launched in the year 2011, Litecoin is an alternative cryptocurrency based on the model of Bitcoin.
Charlie Lee, a MIT graduate and former Google engineer, is Litecoin's creator. Litecoin is based on
an open source global payment network that is not controlled by any central authority. Litecoin
differs from Bitcoins in aspects like faster block generation rate and use of scrypt as a proof of
work scheme.

IcO

The acronym ICO stands for Initial Coin Offering. When an ICO is offered by a company, capital will
be raised through the creation of a new cryptocurrency which can then be bought by investors with
Fiat money or crypto-currencies. ICOs are similar to IPOs and crowdfunding. The big difference be-
tween an ICO and an IPO is the fact that investors in an ICO do not take an actual stake in the
company, as is the case with an IPO. Investors in an ICO are invested in the company but only
indirectly though the cryptocurrency that is being created. If the ICO is successful, the value of this
cryptocurrency is likely to increase and the investors will have made profit.

Smart contracts

Developed by the Ethereum foundation, a Swiss non-profit organisation, Ethereum upends the tra-
ditional approach to offering services on the internet. Instead of building server farms across the
world - staffing them, maintaining them, and securing them - Ethereum makes it possible to build
a global computing infrastructure by using a type of coding called «smart contracts». These con-
tracts allocate computing resources across the blockchain and reward those who use their own
hardware to support the calculations required. With the right skill and hardware, anyone can join
this effort by creating an Ethereum node and be compensated for their contribution, all without a
central coordination authority. Ethereum works in a fully decentralised manner, just as the Bitcoin
blockchain does. Smart contracts are pieces of code, whose execution is ensured by the network
as a whole, in the same way that Bitcoin's transfers and records of funds are policed by the whole
network. This means that applications that run automatically can be built, and the reliability of the
services they offer is guaranteed because there is no single point of failure. Ethereum's smart con-
tracts therefore offer the possibility of an e-commerce platform that has unique properties: privacy
for both the buyer and the seller, complete freedom from censorship and interference, and very
low fees for users.

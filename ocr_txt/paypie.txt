PayPie
1 Executive Summary

1.1 Introduction

PayPie is creating the first decentralized accounting platform for businesses that will provide real-time
insight into financial data to achieve 100% accuracy for a credit risk algorithm that can be used globally.
This analysis will be conducted using a single ledger approach and will consider businesses’ all-time
historical financial data to safeguard and transform the way credit risk is assessed by lenders, investors,
banks and other financial institutions while building a blockchain-backed accounting ecosystem.

PayPie is the first fintech to develop credit risk profile of a business based on an in-built algorithm
to constantly adjust it on the Ethereum blockchain depending upon the changes in more than 150 data
points. This paper gives an overview on how PayPie will enable live financial audits, ends duplicate tasks,
speed up credit approvals and improve the overall credit scoring process by disrupting business
accounting landscape.

1.2 Today - Isolated, Closed & Disconnected Systems

The double entry accounting system was invented more than 600 years ago with the purpose of
minimizing errors in the books of a company with the introduction of debit and credit. It allows firms to
keep records that reflect what the firm owns and owes and what the company has earned and spent over
any given period.

However, accounting systems today are closed systems, and unethical practices from companies like
Enron used accounting limitations to misrepresent earnings and change the balance sheet to show
favorable performance. Today there is no connection between the books of one company with the other
company they are buying or selling products or services to/from. It allows company A to cheat on the
transactions that were happening with company B. This lack of transparency contributed to the largest
bankruptcy in American history at that time and one of the biggest audit failure of our era.

The double entry system solved the problem of companies knowing whether they could trust their books.
However, to win the confidence of outsiders, independent public auditors also verify the company’s
financial information (balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, etc.). The cost of an annual
audit of a moderately sized company starts with the tens of thousands of dollars and can easily reach into
six figures.

Banks now lack real-time financial insights of business, and their decisions are based on historical data
that may be six months to a year old and those numbers do not reveal enough quality data to obtain an
accurate appraisal of the company’s financial health. Traditional financial institutions turn down 72% of
funding requests and other lending players take 2 to 7 business days for due diligence, and if approved, it
takes 2-5 business days to get money in the bank. This is not an ideal situation, and if small and medium-

 PayPie
sized enterprises (SMEs) must accept deferred payments, then these enterprises need new ways to get
financing.

Information in an accounting solution used by a business is usually isolated and closed to the public, so it
is not possible to prove the immutability of records, accuracy of the data without exposing all the business
secrets. Balance Sheet and P/L tells only half of the old story about business. Blockchain handles
anonymity and is capable of bringing reliability by bringing transparency by publishing relevant, valuable
data, and this is going to power the forward-thinking companies in coming years.

2 Target Audience

“PayPie Single Ledger” is going to open an abundance of opportunities for millions of SMEs worldwide.
PayPie takes a disruptive approach to the outdated methods and completely offers a new, safe and secure
way to expose financial data to lenders, auditors or regulatory authorities.

There are many business use cases enabled by the trustless accounting, and being able to build a
transparent & trustful credit risk score of a business that can be used globally, is one of the most
important. Because PayPie already had detailed transactional and financial information on businesses in
some cases better than banks, our proven risk algorithm will score and recommend the best SMEs that
can be selected for financing.

With the underlying health of a business visible on the blockchain, powerful innovation from PayPie could
automate aspects of the regulatory, audit and accounting processes and may have long-term positive
impact on the SMEs.

Some of the first opportunities found are
Opening peer-to-peer lending opportunities to SMEs
Credit opportunities for banks, financial institutions, investors, invoice factoring companies

3 Journal Entries

3.1 Authentic Data

At PayPie, we started looking at how to fix this problem and found that there were more than 60 million
businesses worldwide that can be helped by introducing the blockchain in an accounting software. These

 PayPie
firms can be further supported by a single ledger based on a decentralized accounting platform that ends
duplication of efforts.

PayPie brings transparency to the financials of business by introducing triple entry accounting. Each
journal entry and transaction will be hashed and time-stamped on secure blockchain giving PayPie better
visibility than banks into the financial health of a business that can be used to make a faster decision on
lending. Blockchain in an accounting software brings better visibility into the actual income and expenses
of the business thus reducing risk to the lenders.

The underlying input of a company’s financial is the journal entry data that is being entered manually or
automatically in an accounting or ERP software. The data is used to calculate income, expense, payables,
receivables, etc. and ultimately all financial reports like retained earnings, balance sheet, total assets or
liabilities of a business. With PayPie, every journal entry data is allocated to the blockchain through
automatic API connections to an accounting or ERP software. PayPie will use technology to assign a
unique fingerprint to every transaction performed in an accounting software and publish them on the
blockchain. Typical operations in a business are sales invoices, vendor bills, expenses, debit notes, credit
notes, payroll and other income and expenditure.

3.2 Foundational Accounting Framework

The PayPie platform introduces the blockchain into the existing workflows of an accounting software; the
ones that are already trusted by SMEs.

Accounting software SlickPie will provide the initial accounting logic framework and source code for the
foundation of the PayPie platform to store journal entry and other accounting data. This saves us time in
coding and writing those involved accounting logics, and we already have a great platform to start with.
Adding blockchain record in the world of debit and credit effectively creates a triple entry accounting
system.

PayPie brings transparency to a modern business by building a platform that we will hash all the journal
entries and other relevant information from an accounting software on blockchain so that we can use the
transparency & track record to build a live credit scoring algorithm. We believe an accounting software
has better visibility than banks into the actual finances of a business such as income, expenses, customers,
vendors, payable, receivables, payroll, sales tax, VAT, etc. and we can use this information to build a
trusted platform. The days when financial reports for companies were outdated (by 6-12 months) are
over, and now creditors have live quality data to obtain an accurate appraisal of the company’s financial
health for a better term sheet for financing (interest rate, maturity, annuity, collateral required, etc.).
With all the new data factored in the risk premium, SMEs may qualify for a better term sheet for the
credit.

Finding lending opportunities is the biggest problem being faced by our competitors and that puts PayPie
in a unique position. More than 16,000 SMEs already using the SlickPie accounting software and they are

 PayPie
an asset to the PayPie platform and offer us an advantage as new platforms often face the "chicken or
egg problem." We don't have this issue as we already have access to businesses to kick start our journey
who would be happy to use the PayPie platform.

New core functionality will be added to fetch journal entry and other accounting data from different ERP
softwares in real time. API integration with likes of Xero, QBO, Sage, SAP, NetSuite, etc. will make real-
time financial and credit risk assessment based on triple-entry blockchain immediately available
worldwide. Building strong partnerships with major accounting and ERP systems is a major aim of our
overall marketing strategy. For example, QuickBooks Online has a strong connection with TSheets &
Bill.com, and this makes their services available right inside the QBO to more than 2.3 million users with
the click of a button. We can visualize that day when companies can access short-term lending or finance
their invoices exactly this way by leveraging blockchain technology.

PayPie will also be able to make prompt recommendations based on our ability to predict patterns from
a company’s account history. We will also be able to anonymize financial data from many kinds of
businesses and use that data to give small business owners or investors an idea of lending opportunities
and compare it to anonymized data from other firms in their industry.

Potential implications are enormous as transparency brings a whole new value to businesses, regulators,
and investors. For example, if an auditing firm is looking at various companies and checking all the
transactions on the blockchain to see what has happened or gone on between them, we could take that
data and use data visualization tools to have a view of that segment of the business. Individual companies
have a lot of liabilities to each other, and all this would be visible on the blockchain that they cannot alter.
The cost and time necessary to conduct an audit on a company would also decline considerably because
auditors could easily verify the most critical data behind the financial statements.

Access to the PayPie platform will be free for SMEs interested in offering credit score analytics on the
actual financials of their business for better access to the lending market. An excellent credit score at the
PayPie platform will qualify for best deals from the invoice marketplace.

PayPie will follow IFRS accounting standards so that we are independent of country-specific approaches
that are usually followed by an ERP software.

3.3 Risk Assessment to the Limits of Surgical Precisions

PayPie risk algorithm will score each company based on its financial and transactional history in the
platform. PayPie will have access to the complete history of SMEs in their accounting solution like who
are their vendors, how reliable SMEs are at making payments to their vendors, what’s the projected cash
flow for the coming weeks, months and year based on the historical data, balance sheet, income
statement and other data points. This makes PayPie the first to have a real business accounting platform
to take advantage of blockchain technology and smart contracts to revolutionize the financial sector for
companies. We believe that innovation will help millions of businesses in coming years as we fully utilize
the blockchain to help solve real-world problems, like smart contracts to detect false, inflated or duplicate

 PayPie
invoices or fake reporting. We are thus creating an efficient solution with tremendous global potential by
bringing crypto to the world of decentralized accounting, in the form of the PayPie platform.

like Experian, Dun & Bradstreet, and publicly available XBRL data may also play a role in future as we
develop an ecosystem for real-time credit scoring.

4 Problem of Liquidity

Lack of positive cash flow kills 25% of SMEs out there, and it is more important than ever to keep a business
cash flow positive. Unfortunately, it is one of the biggest challenges faced by small business today, and
SMEs struggle to create new opportunities, implement existing plans, pay salaries, manage working capital
to buy new equipment, and negotiate the best terms with their suppliers. Most business payments get
paid only after 90-120 days and cost them billions in lost opportunities.

Invoice factoring or invoice discounting also known as invoice financing could help. Cash is given to the
SME against outstanding sales invoices instantly by an investor at a cost that creates a solution where
everyone benefits. Millions of businesses worldwide use invoice financing to support their operations of
activities at various stages of their business life cycle. The total market size for invoice finance has been
growing rapidly over 11% per annum and estimated to be over US $3 trillion worldwide where factoring
providers collect the final payment in 90-120 days, profiting from the factoring fee/interest rate. In recent
years, the USA's alternative financial model has exploded. Many traditional commercial platforms have
found that the problem of delay in the invoice payment and the bank’s reluctance to lend to businesses,
is growing. SMEs already face enormous obstacles, and delayed payment has become one of the biggest
problems for the companies worldwide.

Legacy solutions allow sellers to upload or send invoices manually. Those invoices may be fake, false,
inflated and many times the same invoice is sent to 2 different invoice factoring companies which increase
the risk for lenders. There is no solution out there that can start tracking a bill from its point of origin and
end all the manual work of uploading or sending except PayPie. Many times, businesses must submit more
financial documentation that comes from the isolated environments of bookkeeping software.

Invoice verification is one of the most labor-intensive and costly processes today but is a crucial tool in
preventing fraud in factoring invoices. Verification of sent invoices includes multiple steps such as
confirmation that invoiced products and services were delivered as claimed, an inspection and
confirmation that the quantity and quality of the invoiced goods were provided as requested, an onsite
inspection of the work and products to confirm that they met the specifications as invoiced.

 PayPie
The market today demands an urgent need for a trusted platform that lets businesses build a transparent
financial track record that helps them with better access to the funding. Integration of the blockchain
technology with an accounting software is the way to improve transparency, automate lending, and
accelerate processes. The clarity of events in an accounting solution along the supply chain via the
blockchain is an enabler of faster payment, increased efficiency, reduced risk of fraud, and lower costs.
Exchanging information related to these events in a distributed ledger helps trigger events that need to
take place.

And this is precisely the gap that the PayPie is looking to fill. All above can easily be handled by smart
contracts in a triple entry accounting solution. Put simply; it’s a game changer for the industry. Our end-
to-end platform will give SMEs super easy access to short-term financing by turning their accounts
receivables into tradable assets. PayPie platform integration with major accounting and ERP systems
enable automation because all transactions will flow through blockchain and validity of all transactions
including sent invoices can be verified with a click along with associated journal entry data and relevant
documents to assess the risk. Things that demand time and resources today will be completely automated.

5 PayPie Platform Evolvement

We already have a significant pool of businesses using SlickPie as their accounting platform, and now
blockchain and smart contracts can solve their liquidity problem. We also have specific real-time financial
information on their activities; we have all the data and history on their business. We know their
customers, vendors, income, expenses, and money in the bank as live bank feeds pull data on a daily basis.
We are not “chasing potential invoice sellers” around, but will give them a new possibility that works with
their choice of accounting system already being used by them.

Transaction verification is an important part of the lending process and demands time and resources for
the lending firm. Verification of correctness of all the transactions will be available on the blockchain. To
access lending on the PayPie platform, a Know-Your-Customer (KYC) process will be in place for SMEs.

Let’s say you own a business that sells rubber to Nike for their shoes. You are good at your job, but it takes
Nike 90-120 days to pay you for your work. Marketplace lender will buy that invoice from you at a discount
& then wait for Nike to pay the original sum to the lender. This allows you to make payroll, purchase new
materials, hire new people & grow faster.

We have the edge over traditional factoring companies because either they don’t have a pool of invoice
sellers to start with or they don't have access to the live financial data whose immutability is guaranteed
by the blockchain. PayPie will reduce the mortality rate of qualified SMEs by helping them improve their
access to the capital as soon as they click on “Get Paid Now” button inside the app.

5.1 Marketplace - Built on Credit Risk Algorithm

PayPie credit risk algorithm will enable top scoring SMEs to gain immediate access to liquidity by selling
their invoices to the token holders. Because PayPie already had detailed transactional and financial

 PayPie
information on their business, which in some cases better than their banks, our proven risk algorithm will
score and recommend the best companies that can be marketed and selected for financing. Those
companies with a good history and lowest risk score will earn benefits, and incentives will be available.
Token holders will buy invoices at a discounted rate & provide SMEs with the money within 24 hours while
waiting for the first customer to pay the lender original amount as per the term sheet. The PayPie platform
will help SMEs to get immediate funding on monies owed to them by their customers from token holders,
rather than waiting for customers to pay invoices after a long-deferred period that usually causes a strain
on their cash flow.

A token holder can be an individual contributor, lender, investor, bank, or other financial institution. Any
invoices originating from the PayPie platform are tradable assets and the marketplace enables access to
invoice financing along with complete visibility into the history of a business and risks involved. We will
provide historical transactional and financial data & credit rating system built from the blockchain to
enable lending from token holders. Our credit scoring data will be indicating and assessing the risk of
invoice default so that buyers can make educated decisions. Blockchain makes it much easier for smaller
investors to get involved in an industry that has until now been reserved only for big lenders who had the
resources to do background checks and research.

Our algorithm seeks to match the risk appetites of token holders with the risk profile of companies that
need short-term financing. If you are doing well & suddenly find yourself with some extra money, you can
now pay a fee in PPP Tokens & buy an invoice at a discounted rate from an SME whose credit rating would
be given by the platform & wait for their customer to pay you. You will have best possible financial data
on the companies whose invoices you are buying and their customer companies who owe you money.

It means that you will be able to purchase data on how risky your investment in an individual SME’s invoice
is & pay us a fee for giving you access to that data in PPP Tokens. This allows someone in China to buy a
bill at a discount from the SME & then pick up the original amount from its initial customer in the USA by
trusting our real-time credit scoring. All internal payments will be managed using ERC20 compatible stable
“Pie Coins” that are exchangeable for fiat and pegged 1:1 against major currencies to avoid exposure to
fluctuations in the prices of cryptocurrencies.

To prevent defaults, all parties involved will be able to rate each other at the end of the transaction and
this history will be recorded on the immutable Ethereum blockchain to build a Decentralized Trust and
Transparency Rating (DTTR) so that others can make well-informed lending decisions. Smart contracts will
automatically amend each party’s trust rating according to an algorithm after completion of the lending
process.

The PayPie platform connects forward-thinking SMEs worldwide to the trusted and easy lending by
implementing crypto in a triple entry accounting system. PayPie is taking care of the most common issue
lenders are facing today: duplicate lending, lack of transparency and false reporting of financials of the
business. Clear visibility into the business finances will open new doors and opportunities for the masses.

5.2 Future of Accounting — PayPie Single Ledger

This is the most ambitious part of the project, and we are taking a bottom-up approach to this one. We
will use the already built above ecosystem to transform isolated & centralized accounting systems

S PayPie
employed by SMEs worldwide and introduce a new decentralized accounting platform. Instead of keeping
separate records in different accounting software, companies can write their transactions directly into a
joint register, creating an interlocking system of ensuring accounting records.

Business will prepare, sign and send hashed UBL documents and associated smart contracts so that
process from issuing a purchase order, invoicing, delivery of goods and services to the payment can be
seamlessly tracked on a trustless accounting platform. The USA economy alone processes about 25 billion
invoices in a year and this will allow us to remove the "disconnect" that happens when different parties
use different accounting software and will immensely improve the accuracy of our risk analysis score. This
will result in better rates from the marketplace for the invoice sellers as businesses will be able to tap the
resources already built for them.

Our single ledger approach will significantly disrupt established legacy accounting workflows and
regulators in all markets. There will be many uses of trustless accounting on the blockchain. Some other
benefits achieved due to the meaningful application of the technology:

e Nore-keying of data by different parties
e Less time spent in billing collaboration, e.g., following-up unpaid invoices, eliminating duplicate

S PayPie
invoices, ends duplication of efforts
e Automatic distributed reconciliation of financial records
e Automatic & seamless regulatory and compliance documentation
e Traceable audit trails / automated audit process
e Tracking ownership of assets
e = Significant savings on credit insurance, audit & review

5.2.1 No Transaction Fees World

We believe that transaction fees are a business model of the past. Providers like PayPal and Stripe charge
transaction fees that are usually 2.9% + 0.30 for credit card transactions. Once the decentralized single
ledger is set up, PayPie trustless ecosystem can be used to move money among parties without involving
providers like Stripe, PayPal or any other 3" party using internal stable “Pie Coin” pegged 1:1 against major
currencies and balances tracked on the single ledger.

5.2.2 Partnerships and Ecosystem Integration

Single ledger will allow the creation of new business models based on the real-time financial of a business.
Our algorithm-as-a-Service would allow anyone to build new services on top of our services quickly.

Ecosystem integration is an important part of our long-term plan for PayPie. This long-term plan involves
integrating with the third-party popular apps extending functionality (for payroll, CRM, time tracking, the
point of sale, e-commerce, etc.) and exploring synergies that return success for both sides by allowing
them to build blockchain based solutions on top of our platform.

5.2.3 Independent Risk and Valuation Services

We are building better foundations for financial infrastructures by allowing real-time comprehensive
audits, with real-time risk metrics and sensitivity analyses. We enable movement of compliance into smart
contracts rather than a headcount of compliance officers in businesses so cost reduction will be potentially
enormous. Blockchain technology is set to revolutionize not only the internal accounting of businesses
but also the services that are dependent on the financial health of a business.

PayPie would help companies not only with greater transparency, but will also lower the cost of audits
due to streamlining of accounting and finance operations. Company investors do not have to wait for
financial information given on a quarterly basis, and they will be able to respond to opportunities in real-
time.

The role of accounting firms will change, and companies like PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte or smaller
companies like Chun & Company will be focused more on offering advisory services than compliance
ensuring everything is in order. There is no counterparty risk. If the ledger says it is true, then it is true.

Auditors and financiers such as factoring firms could have automated forms of analysis at their disposal
to appraise the underlying health of a balance sheet, a powerful innovation that could automate aspects
of the regulatory, audit and accounting processes. Moreover, such a tool would bring integrity to the
system. All fraud would be much harder to carry out. A public ledger that is continually audited and
verified means that company books can be fully trusted; there is integrity in the statements or the
transaction logs because the network itself verifies this.

 PayPie
Generating any up-to-the-minute financial statement would be straightforward, with the click of a button
providing an immutable, complete and searchable financial statement, free of error.

We foresee factoring firms, banks, investment funds, insurance companies, P2P lenders and private
investors being a customer of PayPie platform to get access to real-time data that is 100% correct and
reflects a genuine picture of a business to offer liquidity to the market by their specific criteria and
expected returns.

6 Technology

6.1 Smart Contracts

At the core of the PayPie platform’s underlying architecture are Ethereum smart contracts. Our design
follows a modular structure, making contracts highly reusable and easy to upgrade. A smart contract is a
computer process that is stored on the blockchain and automatically carries out predetermined functions
once a triggering event has occurred. Legal terms and conditions are embedded in the computer code of
a smart contract, which enables the automatic execution of duties defined by the contract itself while
avoiding the services of a middleman.

All smart contract modules will be written in Solidity.

Technology Stack

Blockchain

Example functions:

An accounting transaction is based on the journal entry data that is tokenized, so each transaction has a
unique identity visible on the blockchain with the rest of the information published at IPFS. A smart
contract will not allow for more financing to be received against an invoice that has already been financed,
thus lowering the risk to lenders allowing them to offer better terms for the credit (maturity, interest rate,
annuity, collateral needed, etc.).

In a traditional platform, invoice sellers enter their invoices manually and make them available for
factoring. Invoice duplication has been a significant obstacle in preventing invoice factoring solutions from
being more easily accessible to SMEs at affordable terms. But the incorporation of blockchain technology
at the source of those transactions ends this issue. In simple terms, there is no other better way to ensure
that an invoice is authentic based on the complete transparency built in an accounting solution.

A smart contract is entered between a lender and an invoice seller showing the borrowing conditions to
which both parties have agreed on. Once tokenized, the contract cannot be altered. The smart contract
will automatically disburse a payment event that needs action to be taken by the bank. The amount is
automatically remitted to the parties once confirmation has been entered into the system.

 PayPie
A smart contract is what enables the existence of the PayPie platform as a truly transparent and
decentralized accounting platform. The whole business process will be embodied in a smart contract,
including issuance, change of ownership and payments on an invoice. Through smart contracts, the
complicated process of collecting the actual real-time financial data, income of a business, expenses,
short-term debts and long-term obligations, etc. can be documented in the contract itself, and business
decision of lending is based on the data we have in distributed Ethereum network and take advantage of
the blockchain qualities.

For example, if a smart contract can be written between an investor and an invoice seller to say that once
the seller is victorious in reaching a particular credit score in the PayPie platform, 80% of the funds will be
released to the invoice seller. A smart contract would automatically disburse payment once the
confirmation is entered into a distributed ledger by the PayPie platform. Smart contracts also offer
protection against duplicate invoice financing, as the contract will not allow for an invoice that has already
been financed, to receive more funding.

A smart contract will include multiple actors such as lenders, borrowers, banks, buyers, sellers and can
trigger payment events based on when a product or service is delivered and ensure they are carried out
automatically. An essential part of the smart contract ecosystem, ‘oracles’ will allow smart contracts a
way to communicate to access information like invoice status change about the beneficiaries.

6.2 Storage

Another core part of the PayPie platform is storage. Since the blockchain has high storage costs, PayPie
adopts IPFS to host business and accounting related media, such as PDFs, word documents, images, videos
and larger metadata on KYC, directors, shareholders, auditors, etc. IPFS is an open source project
developed since 2014 by Protocol Labs with the help from open source community. Nodes in the IPFS
network form a distributed file system, and it is built especially for storing and sharing files.

Both Ethereum and IPFS lack search capabilities, so PayPie will introduce scalable on-chain search
functionality to query data associated with a particular invoice to make it easier for the lenders. Examples
of such queries would be like retrieving the latest status of a particular bill, change in ownership, amount,
due date, etc.

We will be generating a hash string of the files and store digital fingerprint into the Blockchain instead of
storing the whole documents. The integrity of all those documents can be verified again by generating the
fingerprint and comparing it with the fingerprint stored in the blockchain. If they match, the document
will stay unaltered since first writing the hash to the Blockchain.

6.3 Data and API Services

One concern, blockchains are still not capable of supporting the load that the entire accounting industry
would need. The Bitcoin blockchain can handle a maximum of seven transactions per second, Ethereum
— 10-20. The good news is that many people are working on scaling public blockchains and these

improvements are well underway.

PayPie will generate large amounts of data related to the credit risk which will be of tremendous value to
our customers. The data will give market insights that do not exist today. External companies can utilize
risk data as part of their solutions. Parts of our software will be open source, available to the other solution
vendors to use. By doing this, we aim to create a robust ecosystem and with an active community of

adopters.

S PayPie
7 Privacy - Protecting Supply Chain

Privacy is a big concern for businesses and important privacy protection features will be there on the
platform to publish only relevant data. Only core information related to the invoices/ business will be
transparent, and competitors will be able to see, but not name or detect supply chain, customers, vendors
and other relevant information of SMEs. We will explore the possibilities of keeping some of the
information on a private chain like HydraChain or some other Ethereum compatible solution.

All transactions will be encrypted, so only the parties that are immediately involved in a transaction will
be able to see its details. Access to detailed financial data on business can only be granted by the company
itself to lenders, auditors, regulators, managers, and other key stakeholders. We will allow each company
to decide on how much information it is willing to expose to the counterparty if it’s looking for credit or
an audit.

PayPie single ledger would continually be audited and verified by blockchain, so it will be free of fraud,
always up to date and will generate an up-to-the-minute financial statement with the click of a button,
which was not possible so far. Encryption ensures data privacy, giving parties access only to the
information they have been given rights to.

8 PPP — The PayPie Platform Token

PPP Tokens will be based on Ethereum ERC20 standard, a blockchain-based distributed computing
platform. Ethereum allows smart contracts - distributed computer programs that can help online
contractual agreements in a cryptographically secure manner. Ethereum is open-source and adopted by
institutions worldwide JP Morgan, Deloitte, IBM, Microsoft, and Toyota.

PPP Token is the utility token which provides access to the PayPie platform for certain transactions and
services. Each PPP Token grants the holder the right to access certain services including the purchase of
invoices and access to credit histories of SMEs.

Lenders will require PPP Tokens to access the PayPie platform, and tokens can be used to buy discounted
invoices, credit scoring data and real-time financial data of an SME. For example, if you are buying a bill
from business X at a discounted price so that their customer, business Y, can pay you the full invoice
amount at payment deadline - let’s say 120 days from now - will cost you XXX amount of PPP Tokens.

Additional services available on the PayPie platform include changing the beneficiary of an invoice and
financial auditing of SMEs. Financial information verified by blockchain has tremendous value because it
will provide token holders with the ability to view real-time financials of a company.

PPP Tokens carry no rights other than the right to exchange tokens and access services on the PayPie
platform. PPP Tokens do not stand for or confer any ownership right or stake, share or security or
equivalent rights, or any other form of participation relating to the PayPie or PayPie Platform. As activities
are carried out on the platform, PPP Tokens are transferred directly from one participant to another.

 PayPie
Token Supply: 165,000,000 PPP tokens are available for distribution. Only 82,500,000 PPP are
available for sale to contributors.

A total of 27,500,000 PPP are for the team, advisors, bounties etc. Core team and advisors’
tokens will be vested for 12 months with 3 months’ cliff. We wish to benefit only if the
project is operationally successful. Bounty tokens won’t be vested.

The rest 55,000,000 PPP tokens will be kept as a reserve and locked for one year solely to
develop partnerships and future acquisitions to become a dominant market leader.

Price per token: 1 PPP = 0.0011 ETH

9.1 Market

We have a long history of experience working primarily with SMEs & accountants based in the USA and
Canada, and we have already identified the innovative opportunities in these massive markets that will
be leveraged for growth and to capture sizeable market share. We believe there is also a great opportunity
for us in Europe, China, and India. China is already taking the lead in solving credit & lending problems for
SMEs. Experience shows there will be rapid innovation in the Chinese market before other markets catch
up. In India, huge projects to digitize financial transactions have been rolled out in last one year in the
form of demonetization and GST and millions of new businesses will be in market first time who can be
helped by PayPie platform. Entering the bills and invoice marketplace in China & India is one of our
important goals, and we will work towards engaging those markets. Part of the contribution will be used
to make PayPie multi-language to make it more convenient for non-English speaking countries.

9.2 Project Transparency

Transparency is our goal. On successful completion of the crowdsale, we will be providing periodic
updates on the progress of the PayPie platform to token holders using a disclosure service such as
http://www.tokenfilings.com. Once the platform is launched and there are transactions & services
available in the network, there will be a real-time stats API and website so that information is provided
on network activity and growth in real-time to partners and token holders.

10 Conclusion

We believe the "first mover" advantage is on our side. We have a solid team with business, financial &
tech backgrounds. With the emergence of Ethereum, the timing is perfect for blockchain and accounting
data integration to play a significant role in lending, review and audit operations using a decentralized
accounting platform. Traditional players like banks will soon follow suit and will use accounting data for
making credit decisions. Things like relying on credit reference agencies, annual accounting audits &
reviews will become a thing of the past. With countries like Japan accepting a cryptocurrency, blockchain
is likely to go mainstream to help SMEs.

Our proposal is to build a blockchain accounting platform for the 21% century. When connecting the
accounting sector and cryptographic infrastructure, a lot of room will open for business process
optimization, as well as more transparent and efficient functioning of the industries based on the financial
data. With blockchain technology evolving at this rapid pace, we see its implementation in the accounting
industry as unavoidable.

Being the first in the market, plugging the crypto-world into business accounting is a great global
opportunity that no one should miss. We are in a prime and a unique position to become a leader in the
market.

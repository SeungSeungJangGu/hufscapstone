inSure Ecosystem

Decentralized Insurance Platform
inSureDAO
(https://insuretoken.net)

Abstract

inSure is a community based crypto portfolios/DeFi
insurance system. The project aims to create an
ecosystem to distribute the risks, where premiums are
determined by a Dynamic Pricing Model. Capital
required to back the risks at any point of time will be
based on the market pricing of SURE tokens and
community demand for insurances of the crypto
portfolios. Decentralized support system will be

established to diligently process all the insurance
claims and implement the layers of inSureDAO
voters to make sure any fraudulent claims are flagged
and only valid claims are fulfilled.

Background

Insurance is a tool that helps to re-distribute risk
across the community. Due to the extensive amount
of capital required to underwrite these risks, the multi-
trillion-dollar industry is dominated by huge
companies that have the ability to pool capital at scale
for potential claim obligations. [1]

The profitability of insurers depends on the amount
of claim payouts relative to the amount of premiums
collected. Despite heavy regulatory oversight, there
exists an agency problem as there is an incentive for
insurers to turn down claims. In addition, the
conservative nature of insurers and their increasing
reliance on data-driven risk assessments means that
the protection gaps of newer risks will continue to
remain unfilled.

An example of an underserved segment is the
Decentralized Finance (DeFi) sector and crypto. The
rapid development of DeFi and innovative liquidity
mining schemes have brought about a substantial
increase in the total value of assets utilized on the

blockchain. Liquidity providers are willing to provide
capital to bootstrap DeFi products in return for yields
without fully understanding the potential security
risks. Even with security audits in place, the nascent
DeFi sector continues to be a target of hacks, smart
contract exploitations, resulting in the loss of users’
funds.

inSure is purposefully designed to solve the agency
problem and allow anyone to become an insurance
issuer for the DeFi sector and crypto portfolio
holders. inSure Ecosystem is created to protect
traders and investors from scams and drastic
devaluations that threaten crypto portfolios.

What we Do: Offering the Best Insurance for Crypto

Portfolios.

We are tired of seeing people get scammed and having
no collateral for their DeFi losses. Our solution will
protect your portfolio from scammers and
unexpected losses. We provide different plans that are

very clear and simple to understand.

Mission: Protect Crypto Investors from Scammers &
Devaluations. The first idea behind this project is to
get rid of the situations where our fellow investors
lose their money completely.

We are here to provide stability to the crypto world
and protect people from their mistakes and from
fraudulent activities of others.

Goal: Help as Many Investors & Traders as Possible.
We don't want our fellow investors & traders to end-
up in a situation where they lose most of the crypto
portfolio because of unexpected causes.

Helping other people is very important to us. We are
willing to establish a 24/7 support system to help as
many people as possible.
Economic Model - How it works

inSure’s Crypto insurance is based on 1) Dynamic
Pricing Model|2], to find the right market price via
supply and demand; 2) the Capital Model[3], to secure
capital required to back the risks at any points of time;
and 3) inSureDAO voting mechanism, to make sure
every claim is handled in a permissionless and

transparent manner.

Google Cloud-blockchain Applications &
inSute Ecosystem

Blockchains focus on mathematical effort to create a
shared consensus. Ideas quickly sprang up to extend
this model to allow party-to-party agreements, i.e.
contracts. This concept of smart contracts was first
described in a 1997 article by computer scientist Nick
Szabo [4]. An early example of inscribing agreements
into blocks was popularized by efforts such as
Colored Coins [5] on the Bitcoin blockchain.

Smart contracts are embedded into the source of truth
of the blockchain, and are therefore effectively
immutable after they’re a few blocks deep. This
provides a mechanism to allow participants to
commit crypto-economic resources to an agreement
with a counterparty, and to trust that contract terms
will be enforced automatically and without requiring
third party execution or arbitration, if desired.

But none of this addresses a fundamental issue: where

to get the variables with which the contract is
evaluated. If the data are not derived ftom recently
added on-chain data, a trusted source of external data
is required. Such a source is called an oracle.

inSure Ecosystem is planning to use Chainlink and
Google Integration to receive the data that is updated
and available though the trusted off-chain bridge.

We are working on creating a hybrid application that
takes the best of what smart contract platforms and
cloud platforms have to offer. We're particularly

interested in bringing Google Cloud Platform's ML
setvices (e.g. AutoML [6] and Inference APIs[7}).

Capital Pool

The Capital Pool is an important business module of
the platform to support the business development.
inSure tokens will be rewarded to capital providers of
the pool [8].

The tokens received from staking on DEXs could be
used to

1) stake on the projects and earn premium;

2) hold to enjoy the benefit from the growth of the
ecosystem and leverage provided;

3) sell in the market to realize profit.

With the support of the capital pool, business will
generate attractive profit to inSure token holders,
which will result in the increase of the token price.
Higher token price will further attract more capital to
conduct business.

When the surplus pool is unable to cover the
Minimum Capital Requirement (MCR) [9], the
withdrawal transaction of the capital pool will be
frozen until the drop of MCR, which may result from
the expiration of insurance plans or the coming of
new funds.

When the surplus pool cannot cover all the claims, the
capital pool will be used to pay the rest. The Capital
Model is used to monitor systematic risk, and give the
capital pool attractive risk adjusted return.

Purchase Insurance

An insurance stipulates the insurance tisk, the
insurance amount, the date of insurance and the
corresponding premiums. Users can use ETH,
USDT, BTC, wETH to get the desired insurance plan
for their crypto portfolio. The insurance will
automatically take effect after 7 days of SURE tokens
being placed to the private wallet of the policyholder.

The policyholders will also share a small portion of
the capital surplus. We believe this mechanism will
help the community to attract enough capital supply
and demand to further expand the ecosystem.

Surplus Pool

The surplus pool will accrue whenever an insurance
premium is paid. 40% of the premium will be added
into the surplus pool. Another 10% will be reserved
till the expiration of the contract. If there is no claim,
it will add into the surplus pool. The surplus pool will
grow over time and will be utilized to cover insurance
claims first. [10] When the surplus pool cannot cover
all the claims, the capital pool will be used to pay the
rest. When the surplus pool grows large enough, the
SURE holders will receive % from the staked SURE
to better incentivise increase of the inSure Staked

Pool.

inSure holders can stake on different DEXs and earn
% from each trade in addition to the insurance that

inSure plans provide.

For the first phase, we will focus on the risk against
scams, devaluations and stolen funds. More less-
correlated business will be introduced to deliver
higher returns to token holders at community’s vote.

Risk Model Consideration

Risks are diverse. It is technically impossible for us to
measure all risks and accurately calculate the required
tisk capital. Therefore, the risk reserve mentioned
here refers to the minimum capital requirement that
will not lead to "bankruptcy". We determine the
minimum capital requirements based on the capital
model. The source of the risk reserve consists of two
parts, one part comes from the withdrawal of a certain
percentage of the amount from each insurance policy,

and the other part comes from the special
compensation amount locked in the claim pool.

First of all, we must identify and select the main risks
to be considered, which are mainly divided into four
categories: asset risk, pricing risk, interest rate risk and
other business risks; Secondly, use the probability of
bankruptcy to calculate the risk coefficient and
determine the risk capital required for this type of risk;
Finally, we make adjustments based on the correlation
between the risks. [11]

Assuming that the total amount of the claim pool is
A and the asset value of the insured amount is L, it
should be ensured that for any small ¢, P{L > A} <
¢.[12] The platform’s surplus level is (A-L), 40% of
which is withdrawn to the remaining and 60% of the
risk reserve is used for dividends and management.

We set the random variable X=-(A-L), and the
venture capital MCR is the minimum capital required
to resist the adverse fluctuation of i. If ¢ = 0.05, the
probability that X is not higher than the minimum
capital level MCR must remain above 95%, that is
P{X < MCR} 2 95% . The minimum capital level
MCR is obviously related to the confidence level 1 —
e.If we know the distribution function of X, F(x), and
we are going to require MCR, we only need to set F
(MCR) = ¢, which is the quantile point corresponding
to e. Its geometric meaning is shown in the figure
below, where E(X) represents the expected level of
the fluctuation of unfavorable earnings and MCR
represents the minimum capital requirement.

If we consider only one type of risk, the principle is
the same. Unfavorable volatility is X=E (A)-A or
X=L-E (L). Venture capital MCR can be understood
as the minimum capital requirement to absorb
unfavorable fluctuation, namely P{E(A) -— A >
MCR} Se or P{L—E(L)>MCR}<e . If the probability
distribution of A or L is known, then MCR is the
corresponding number of points, expressed as:

MCR=E(A)-)(6) ot MCR=y(1—¢)-E(L).

Suppose we make A or L obey a normal distribution,
then MCR=®(e)Xo or MCR=®/(1—<)Xo , MCR then
the risk factor of the asset is 4/4) ot #2), which is the
ratio of the minimum capital requirement to the
premium. From this, we can calculate the minimum
capitals required for future claims based on the
amount of premium and hence adjust the covariance

In addition, if the expected cost of bankruptcy is
increased, we are required to control the expected
cost of bankruptcy to a percentage lower than the
expected gap, such as 1% or 0.1%. When considering
the liability tisk, it can be assumed that the asset value
is fixed. The asset value L of the insured amount is a
random variable, and it obeys a continuous
probability distribution whose distribution density is
p(x). EPD refers to the overall average of the portion
of liabilities exceeding assets, the so-called gap or
bankruptcy cost [13], that is:

Di =| (4-AP(X dx a

Suppose we have n types of businesses of the same
scale, the concentration is f = 7/n the premium
income of the largest type of business / the premium
income of all businesses, and the risk capital MCR of

each type of business is the same.

Assumption 1: we overestimate MCR, and
Assumption 2: we underestimate MCR. Thus just
offset their adverse effects. The concentration
adjustment factor is

Vpt+(t-afzr\otri-pxf

Given f is relatively small. If it is assumed that the
average correlation coefficient between each business

is 0.4, then g = 0.4, Vp = 0.63. Then the adjusted

reserve tisk capital requirement MCR=63%+37%(the
largest business reserve/all business reserves).

Pricing principle

The pricing of insurance products is to use the data
of past accidents to obtain the probability of risk. This
risk and its probability of occurrence are objective and
measurable. This is also the fundamental basis for
determining the insurance premium. [14]

The law of large numbers is that when enough events
of the same nature occur, their risk probability will be
closer and closer to the actual probability, so that a
more accurate estimate can be obtained. Since there
are differences in the way of thinking of each
individual in real life, it cannot be assumed to be
independent and identically distributed, so it is more.
[15]

In mote detail, if we take into account the correlation
of risks between different businesses, we have to
quote the Chebyshev Theorem of Large Numbers.
[16]

Suppose that x1, X1, x2, *"" » Xn are a group of
independent random individuals, each of which has
an expected value E(xk) and a variance D(xk). If there
is a constant MCR which makes D(xk ) S
c(k=1,2,....n), then for arbitrarily small positive the
final cover price for the claim settlement and internal
cost.

The model has the following pattern:
When capital supply is high, i.e. more power is backed

for a tisk, the premium rate will be low.

When demand is high, i.e. more policies (insurance
plans) are sold out, the premium rate will increase.
More token is backed for a risk, i.e. more popular, less
volatile of premium rate change is, and vise versa for
a less popular risk, the premium rate will be sensitive

for large demand change to avoid pricing ertor.

Capital Model

Insurance is a highly leveraged industry; therefore,
the primary concern of the insurance capital model is
to calculate the capital requited to guarantee
solvency of the risk pool to some arbitrary and high
confidence level like 99.9% in the latest EIOPA’s

Solvency II framework. [17]

The Capital Model is used to calculate the minimum
capital the fund needs to hold, which is used to
determine 1) the capital locked in the Capital Pool
and 2) the staking power used in the Staking stage.

Pricing Model

However, due to the current lack of historical data on
smart contract exploits, scams, devaluations, loss of
funds and lack of relevant information on assisting
pricing, it is expected that the cost of the new policy
at the beginning will be higher. As the insurance
policies undergo more related tests, the processing
cost will gradually decrease.

Rather than a single centralized entity setting up a
premium rate, or individual capital suppliers and
policy holders having to negotiate over premium
terms, inSure uses the Dynamic Pricing Model to set
the price, based on supply and demand, the tokens
backed and the policies bought. We assume the risk
backers’ thinking to follow a beta distribution.

be used for paying the premium and the liability will
also be based off these currencies accordingly.
Therefore, we will exchange the exposure with all
other currencies into a stable currency.

Submitting Request

If your portfolio was affected by scam, drastic
devaluation or stolen funds (exchange closure) inSure
Ecosystem will be reimbursing losses based on the
plan chosen by you with SURE tokens.

If the policy holder was unlucky and was affected by
one of three reasons mentioned above, the email
request need to be sent to — request@insuretoken.net
including:

1. [Name of the crypto coin/token]
2. [Your Affected wallet address]
3. [Date of the event]

4. [Policyholder's wallet address that holds SURE
tokens]

5. [Additional information to take into account]

6. [Sign the following message with your
myEtherWallet (that holds SURE tokens): "I am the
holder of SURE tokens requesting inSure team to
process my request:
{include_all_points_from_1_to_5}"

Please give us 3-4 business days to process your
request (we will investigate the issue and provide the
best solution within 24-72 houts).

Claim Assessment

Claim is one of the most important parts of an
insurance company. To ensure it is handled
professionally, inSure utilizes a 3-phase voting

mechanics for claim assessment.

A claim can be submitted by any policyholder. 100%
Premium equivalent inSure tokens need to be staked
to file the claim. The claim request will to be signed
with the Ethereum Wallet of the policy holder.

There will be a 7 days waiting period for new
purchases, which means a policyholder has to wait 7
days before his coverage comes into effect, any claims
occurred during these 7 days will not be paid. No
waiting period for renewal business.

The initial parameters will be set at research based on
the current data we have and will also be monitored
and updated based on backers’ behavior and
community vote.

The capital model result will be calculated off-chain

a

jaily, due to gas consideration, to track the systematic
tisk.

inSure proposes the second phase of voting to be

done by the top 5 auditing companies that are chosen
by inSure token holders. Auditing companies will
stake their inSure holdings to vote and release
auditing reports if needed. 5% of the reserved policy
premium will be utilized to incentivise the auditing
companies. When the decision is made with at least
3/5 consensus over a claim assessment. If consensus
is not reached or there are not enough auditing
companies’ votes then the case will pass to the next
phase.

During the pending phase, policyholders can stake
inSure tokens and start a challenge. If there is no
challenge by any inSure holders, then the claim will be
approved and paid. If there is a challenge, then the
claim assessment will escalate to the third phase - a
public vote.

The first phase of this 3-phase voting can be
substituted with a lighter round of voters by decision
from inSureDAO.

Fulfillment of Insurance Claims

inSureDAO will process the request with diligence
and initiate a transfer of SURE tokens in the amount
of insured value based on the plan chosen by the
policyholder.

inSure holders are not forced to sell SURE tokens,
instead, the customer can sell later to other investors
who need insurance for their Crypto Portfolio or keep
part of SURE for staking and enabling another
insurance renewal plan.

Distribution of inSure tokens

The first issuance is aimed at a small group of
cryptocurrency enthusiasts, who also serve as beta
product testers to provide feedback on complex
insurance products prior to its release. The short to
mid-term development goal is to build a safe
ptoduct/plans that serve the DeFi sector’s and crypto
investors insurance needs. Majority of the short-term
inSure tokens will be distributed via risk pool increase
and through participation of the inSureDAO.
Broader sales, distribution and marketing channels
will be established once the product has a consistent
base of users. Given that future iteration of the
insurance products require users to purchase inSure
tokens to Stake or to be utilized as currency for
settlement, a set of sales and payment procedures, as
well as wallet tools will be developed to achieve large
scale growth.

Our long-term development goal is not only to make
products with great use cases, but to build a non-
discriminatory platform that allows the masses to
participate freely.

Distribution partners can use the integrated open API
architecture of the Ethereum blockchain to interact
with our SURE smart contract. Users who hold
inSure tokens are potentially our sales partners,
because every insurance coverage sold generates
dividends for all holders of inSure. We will make the
smart contract platform design as open and flexible as

possible so that distribution partners can interact and

communicate under the prescribed conditions.

Competitive Advantage of inSure

A key factor in making a good insurance platform is
the health of financial information, such as the usage
of funds and whether there are sufficient premium
floats to pay potential claims. Since the blockchain is
a distributed ledger, each node has the same copy of
the data. When the data changes, every insured person
can see the synchronized and updated data, making
the operation of each fund open and transparent.
Therefore, there will be a dedicated module on the
homepage of the website to disclose relevant
information, and provide an accurate real-time
financial status every quarter such as tisk factors,
minimum capital requirements, historical data on
token prices, a summary of claims assessment, and the
number of locked and traded tokens.

Roadmap Update

We will continue to pay attention to product
improvements based on market feedback, and launch
new products with blockchain code as the core to
meet the needs of more users. We hope that with
time, community members will drive each other to
jointly promote and develop open-source tools for
inSure. We are also planning to invest a surplus pool
into the hedge funds and long term financial products.
As a result of investments activities share the profits
proportional to the size of the SURE stake.

Capital Pool Size Increase

The capital pool size will scale alongside the type of
product offerings, which will increase the level of
diversification benefits for users of inSure. This
ensures the effective use of funds, reduces risk costs,
reduces the risks caused by insufficient claims, and
makes the cost of copying the project much higher. A
meaningful network of risk assessors (reputable smart
contract code auditors) will be established, and
sufficient incentives will be provided for the users to
participate.

Governed by Community

Under normal circumstances, all operations on inSure
can be completed by smart contracts. But in reality, in
order to take into account, the interests of users,

better achieve decentralization effects, and ensure the
process to be more transparent, decisions of certain
events will require the community to vote. Therefore,
the platform will set up an inSureDAO organization
to facilitate such decisions and manage extreme
situations. It should be noted that inSureDAO does
not have the custody of the fund pool, nor can it
release funds to any specific person. Each committee
member may be replaced by voting at any time. [18]

inSureDAO will work in accordance with the two
core principles of sustainability (that ensures the
interests of community members by ensuring the
sustainability of the overall funding pool) and growth
(promoting sustainable premium increases and
inSureDAO membership growth). The members of
the inSureDAO organization include several people
with specific expertise in insurance, co-governance,
and blockchain development. Some powers that
committee members have are: (1) Reaching consensus
to implement specific code that cannot be

automatically deployed; (2) Punishing bad actors
within the inSure ecosystem (such as malicious claims,
false claims, etc.) by burning SURE tokens. (3) The
power to implement emergency suspension under
special citcumstances.

inSureDAO membets can negotiate and propose
relevant proposals to the benefit of the inSure
network. The voting proposals must include clear
voting options and inSureDAO's recommendations.
Then each community member is given a period of
time to vote, and the result with a majority decision
will be implemented. Any inSure holder can become
a member of inSureDAO.

N.EXCHANGE

A WHOLE ECO-SYSTEM

Accommodate all of your crypto needs
Under one roof

Whitepaper | Last updated: 2018.06.19

Abstract

n.exchange is a multi-component ecosystem, designed to accommodate a wide variety of the
cryptocurrency community’s needs.

While solutions for those needs exist individually, across many platforms, they are not always
implemented to perfection, and are often unreliable, non-transparent or hard to use.

The five main components of the system are the Exchanges: HybriDEX multi-chain dex and
n.exchange INSTANT, MultiPick multi-mining pool, EasyMerchant solution, and a line of comple-
mentary services including high quality content, the various utilities that leverage our open API,
coin capitalisation and portfolio trackers and liquidity-sourcing services.

By aggregating those components into one platform, we enhance user experience and eliminate
redundancy, fees and funds transition time.

Our goal is to maximise each one of the components individually, by providing an outstanding
service with a sharp edge, for low fees; thus, becoming the industry’s first regulated, transparent,
high-liquidity A-Book broker.

We are sourcing liquidity to traditional financial institutions and blue-chip companies.
The definition of genius is taking the
complex and making it simple.

Dear customers and crowdsale participants,

We founded n.exchange after seeing a pressing need in the market, first-hand.

From the very beginning, the idea behind n.exchange has been to establish a platform that cus-

tomers can fully trust. One that is designed to have no conflict o

f interest with the client, and

which has the potential to become the first regulated A-Book broker in the crypto sphere.

We have designed our solution to have the smallest
to take no custody of customer funds, whatsoever.

We work hard to build a relationship of trust and tra

system trust-free wherever possible n.exchange insta

In cases where the custody of user funds is inevitab

h our customers, we keep the

nt as our beach-head product.

ure that we follow the correct

regulations to do it legally, with the correct security measures to avoid disaster, and the correct
insurance coverage to recover from it, if it still strikes.

We strongly believe that in order for this sphere to prosper, one of the key principles of the new-
ly-minted crypto economy, decentralisation, must prevail.

Therefore, we encourage every customer to take custody of their own funds, and to use the vari-
ety of services we offer to exchange cryptocurrency, fiat or goods, using the merchant solution;
to mine or remit cryptocurrency, all under one roof - securely, transparently, and with zero trans-

mission time.

Oleg Belousov,
CEO.

3. Quantifiable Value Proposition (QVM)

Localisation remark:

All products will be 100% device portable, with i18n support for the most common languages.

N.EXCHANGE INSTANT

1. n.exchange features a modern, crisp and easy-to-use instant exchange.
With n.exchange you can trade any listed cryptocurrency asset directly between your
wallets or purchase cryptocurrency, with fiat, directly to your wallet.
All of the above is accomplished simply, transparently, and efficiently.
With n.exchange you receive a final quote for your trade prior to completing the
transaction. This quote will include all fees and will be valid for 15 minutes after being
issued, at no additional charge.
This is such a unique feature that we are still Unsure how to quantify it - especially
since it is well-known that the cryptocurrency market can move very quickly within
this period of time.
Additionally, all fees in n.exchange’s INSTANT for major pairs are fixed at 0.5%. This is,
on average, two to three times less than our direct competitors charge. In other words,
an average of 1 BTC of fees is saved for every 100 BTC traded.
This service is a great market-taker liquidity provider for the decentralised exchange
described below.
N.EXCHANGE HYBRIDEX

2.

n.exchange features a zero maker fee from the very first transaction. This means that
our customers directly save 250 BTC every few hours (or 100 O00 BTC in volume)
based on a flat fee of 0.25%.

Whereas some might perceive this as an aggressive move, we see it as a necessity in
this highly competitive market, where ‘liquidity and market-depth’ is the name of the
game.

n.exchange as no minimum order size. Every trade is a trade; it is not our intention to
exclude anyone from the market. Furthermore, with our robust and seamlessly scal-
able infrastructure, there is no reason for any limitation, as such.
n.exchange offers 12 decimal point precision on every traded pair, regardless of its
liquidity or popularity. Our goal is to be the native platform for HFT traders, featuring
a comprehensive API, the lowest response times, and the highest precision.

n.exchange supports decentralised p2p exchanges natively on the Ethereum smart-
chain. This means that both Ethers and ERC20 tokens are supported, out of the box.
Additionally, multi-chain transactions are possible, against an Ether or ERC20
collateral.

N.EXCHANGE EASYCOMMERCE

Merchant transactions are executed as taker trades on one or more markets (pairs),
depending on whether the merchant had chosen to be paid in fiat, cryptocurrency or
any other combination of currencies.

The service incurs a nominal fixed fee per payout only, which saves merchants and
end clients at least 1% of turnover, amounting to $10 000 USD for every 1 000 000
of turnover.

N.EXCHANGE MULTIPICK

The mining pool, which is already active within a private alpha, supports all major
algorithms (SHA256d, Scrypt, X11, X13, X15), as well as merge-mining and multi-min-
ing. The proposed edge offers a profitability of more than 20%-30% per every valid
hash, by dynamically looking for ‘arbitrage’ (coins with actual low difficulty and rela-
tively high market demand).

In addition, we are currently experimenting with merge-mining. This concept allows
the pool to use the same hashes for N different coins, provided they share the same
algorithm and difficulty d, < d.,

Once a block is mined, it is sold immediately, depending on the pay-out preferences of
the miners that hold the shares for mining this block.

Trading of supported pairs happens on the n.exchange native market; therefore, elim-
inating latency, redundant fees and other fees and overheads.

ZEROBALANCE

n.exchange strives to perform all exchange operations in a decentralised manner and
with minimum custody of customer funds. The system is designed to encourage cus-
tomers to take custody of their own funds, and only to deposit those funds, into the
hands of the exchange, when they intend do so, in full conscience.

This proposed approach is in complete contrast to the industry’s current (common)
practice, where customers are led to deposit their funds by default, and where with-
drawing those funds is made as difficult as possible.
This is one of our strongest product principles - we call it ZeroBalance.

Although ZeroBalance is quantifiable to only O, we strongly believe that this principle
is one of our strongest value propositions. We also believe that it will protect the dig-
ital wealth of our customers, far beyond anything our competitors can offer.

SINGLE BALANCE

n the event a user chooses to leave their funds on the platform, those funds will be
easily accessible from any component of the platform: easily, freely, and with no re-
strictions. Funds can be moved freely from the mining pool and the merchant solution
o the exchange (through a self-managed wallet).

n fact, the term “moving” is not appropriate, as those funds are credited to a single
edger, in the first place, and governed exclusively by the user.

5. Token Economy

5.1. Token Usage

During the first year of its lifetime, you can use your token to cover up to 100% of your
trading costs.

Additionally, you can use token to:

@ cover up to 50% of your mining pool.n.exchange fees for 2 years;

@ obtain a discount, of up to 10% on merchant services powered by merchant.n.exchange, during the 3
years following the crowdsale end - limited to 10% of the total token supply per year.

It is as simple as signing an additional transaction with MetaMask when trading, withdrawing
funds from the mining pool, or purchasing goods or services with the merchant solution.

5.2. Buy Back

At end of each Quarter, we will dedicate up to 50% of our profits to starting a large, organised,
token buy-back, powered by smart contract.

The smart contract will receive our designated profit-share continuously, through each quarter.
This will allow token holder to exit their stake easily and seamlessly, simply by sending NEX to-
kens to the address of the contract on the first calendar week of the next quarter as following:

1st - 7th 1st - 7th 1st - 7th 1st - 7th

JANUARY APRIL JUNE SEPTEMBER

Repurchase is carried out on a first-come-first-served basis, and is limited to one calendar week.

The price is defined by an oracle, which provides the weighted average price of NEX tokens on
he market.

We reserve the right to use the remaining funds in the contract at the end of each repurchase
period, as well any other part of the funds, for direct market making.

This move is designed to allow anyone, who wishes to sell their stake in the token, to do so; push-
ing out the “weak hands”, while maintaining the transparent and fully auditable product.

All re-purchased tokens will be burned immediately and automatically, by the smart contract.
Note: for transparency purposes, all data, including all available cold and warm reserves, as Well as
turnovers, found blocks, and commenced merchant turnover are available for the public to view and

audit.

5.3. Buy back notification

n.exchange will send an email reminder, about the relevant buy-back to all subscribers according
to the following schedule:

—— Unique properties

@ The current process is time-consuming and exhausting, comprising: the deposit of funds into a custodi-
al exchange; the wait for them to confirm; the subsequent placement of a limit order; the wait for it to
execute; the addition of a withdrawal address, and its confirmation by email; and the completion of a
withdrawal request (and its approval by email). We shorten this into two steps:

@ Open a trade with your desired withdrawal address

@ Pay it into a unique deposit address
That leaves you free to get on with the more important things in life.

@ Complex conversions, which would normally require a combination of two or more trades over one or
more markets, are immediately possible and seamless

@ The exchange lets you know the final rate, for your transaction, before sending any funds

@ The exchange automatically recalculates a trade, if the order expires because of a delayed deposit (due
o market conditions or third party fault)

@ The exchange lets you to assign an address as ‘re-usable’, hence, any funds deposited to that address will
be automatically converted to the same asset as the original order, and at the latest market price

@ The exchange sends an optional notification for every order or KYC status change, for better tracking,
accountability and auditability

@ The exchange is completely transparent (whole order, deposit, withdrawal and pricing history are visible
under our API)

Docs: https://nexchange2.docs.apiary.io/

@ The frontend of the exchange is completely open-source, and has an active community behind it.
https://github.com/onitsoft/nexchange-open-client-react

6.2. White-Labelling and Service-Based Services

The API is accessible to anyone, at any time, without the need for authentication (aside from fiat
conversions, as specified in the n.exchange INSTANT specs - compliance section and restricted
geo-political areas as per the TOS).

A simple order can be created by [POST] to https://api.n.exchange/en/api/v1/orders/.
This order will be executed following exactly the same logic as is described in the n.exchange
INSTANT specs.

All in accordance with our detailed API specs that can be found, at any time, under

https://nexchange2.docs.apiary.io/

In the long-term, we intend to direct n.exchange HybriDEX features and liquidity through this
API, in order to allow institutional and other non-decentralised clients to enjoy our services.

It is possible to receive affiliate payouts for each transaction, regardless of the extent to which
you use the API, as described in detail in Organic Growth Engine - Affiliate Program.

13
—— oAuth2

In addition to the basic use, described above, it is possible to gain access to advanced future (order
history, referral stats, user settings, reusable addresses) using oAuth2 authentication. Your oAuth2
token would also grant you access to some basic, non-personal information about the trades of
users whom you have referred. All in accordance with our API docs.

—— Hosted Services

n.exchange offers an easy, hosted solution based on our open source frontend
https://github.com/onitsoft/nexchange-open-client-react

Anyone is free to use the frontend, in order to operate a subsidiary exchange freely, as long as
the following conditions are fulfilled:

@ A sufficient level of design and UX is maintained

® Credits to the n.exchange are displayed in both the footer and the TOS

@ Source repo is open-source and has both NOTICE and LICENSE files in their original form
® Backend interaction is made exclusively with our official api at api.n.exchange

We will charge a fee of $10 000 USD and a $500 USD monthly maintenance fee, to remove any
of the above restrictions.

We will charge a fee of $50 000 USD and a $2000 USD monthly maintenance fee for a fiat-en-
abled white label with managed KYC.

Tauschkrypto.de benefits a lot from the hands on support of n.exchange, as well as
the remarkable in-house expertise Oleg and his team has to offer.

From setup to maintenance up to further developing the business, we are con-

stantly experiencing great work as well as integrity, honest interest in our needs
and goals, and communication skills.

4 Michael Cernischi
—— Independent Services

In some cases, when the customer requires it, we would provide a completely stand-alone ver-
sion of our services, including a full stand-alone backend, where applicable.

The base cost of this service, for the instant exchange, is $100 000 USD.A basic maintenance

package, which includes infrastructure, basic customisation, support, and managed KYC is $2000
USD. 5 monthly developer hours could be added for $1000 USD additionally.

6.3. Merchant solution

—— Assets

As a Starting point, the merchant solution supports all the assets in (Instant Exchange supported
assets illustration).

Once out of Beta, the support will be extended to top 100 liquid Ether tokens, and top 100 non
ether-assets.

This means that our solution will be by far the product with the most wide asset support on the
market.

Any supported asset is available both to the end-client, as well as to the merchant, for the pur-
pose of receiving payments.

—— Fees

EasyCommerce features a flat fee structure, all purchases result in an order(or several orders)
using our API (which then sources it to the DEX a market trade).

This means that the price remains fixed for 15 minutes, and there are not additional fees, nor a
‘transparent’ markup which is used by some competitors to increase their margins.

With n.exchange EasyCommerce, what you see is what you get!

Additional fees:

A transaction fee for withdrawing EasyCommerce balance would be applied, as with all other
components of the ecosystem.

Transaction fee info can be viewed via our API at https://api.n.exchange/en/api/vi/currency

— Payouts

Any incoming payments are converted immediately, according to the merchant’s payout prefer-
ences, in a matter that carries no additional risk for the merchant.

A merchant payout can be divided into an unlimited number of supported currencies, as long as
the payout in each currency meets the minimal requirements specified by our API, and the sum
of each currency does not exceed the available balance.

All payouts occur automatically, both in crypto and in fiat, once the minimal balance, as defined
by our API is reached.
This minimal balance can be adjusted according to the user’s preference.

For a payout to occur, a withdraw address for the desired address needs to be pre-defined by
the customer.

If no such address is present, the funds will remain on the ecosystem’s SingleBalance, available
to withdraw, to trade via HybriDEX, or to be used as collateral.

Reference: https://api.n.exchange/en/api/v1/currency

—— BITools

n.exchange easy commerce provides a variety of actionable BI metrics to enhance the custom-
er’s experience.

Starting from simple data such as revenue per coin and through with a cross reference of vol-
umes, traded pairs, referrals codes, source web-addresses and a timeline.

—— Unique properties

Aside the trivial advantages of large amount of supported assets, zero markup conversion and
a several seamless integrations for the leading e-commerce platforms, there are several other
points worth noting.

Firstly, we would like to emphasise not only crypto-to-fiat conversion, but also crypto-business-
es wishing to integrate payments in different coins.

A typical example use case would be ICO/TGE crowd sales, and the industry giants, such as local-
bitcoins and paxful would be the perspective clients, for an easy gateway to integrate seamless
support in deposits and payouts in currencies which are not natively supported on their plat-
forms.

— Advance API Usage

While the easiest integration for our solution would be by using one of our pre-pared payment
pages or widgets, the entire functionality is available via a REST API fso you can implement your
customer’s experience on your own, if needed.

6.4. Mining Pool
—— Supported Assets
The mining pool supports the following algorithms:

® scrypt - Litecoin, Verge, Doge, DigitByte (and more)
@ sha256 - Bitcoin, Bitcoin-Cash, PeerCoin DigiByte (and more)

@ x11, x13, x15 - Dash, FuturoCoin, Boson (and more)

We support all the altcoins that use those algorithms and are currently trading!
—— Fees

All mined blocks and collected transaction fees are subject to a 1% PPLNS/PPS fee (5 times lower
than our main competitor - ProHashing).

@ n.exchange HybriDEX allows the user to trade any cryptocurrency pair (including non-smart chains) and
withdraw it immediately, using the user’s tokens and ethers as collateral.

An immediate withdrawal of the purchased tokens is allowed, given sufficient collateral is present.

The position is then maintained via a 1x (or more) leveraged trade, with no extra costs, up to the first
rollover (8 hours).

@ n.exchange HybriDEX allows margin trading against real-life, existent assets in an auditable and prov-
ably fair way.

The providers of the margin could be users within our eco-system, or literally anyone who is willing to
borrow money, for the purposes of margin-trading via a dedicated smart contract for smart chains, or by
using our API for non-smart chains.

@ Institutional trading features

As part of our vision at n.exchange, we believe that the biggest potential lies in the future, and more
specifically, in the institutional investment sphere.

To benefit from this vision, we provide enterprise-grade reporting with easy integration for filing both
corporate and personal tax returns; traditional API-bridge for the DEX, for companies that cannot use a
dex, yet, because of their internal policies; insurance for funds in custody; and the possibility to receive
notarised/apostilled documents confirming balances, deposits, withdrawals, trades, fees and any other
ledger entries.

In addition to the whole eco-system of n.exchange HybriDEX, another key feature is the possibility to
source liquidity to other platforms. Industry giants or small companies in the beginning of your journey
- we will gladly include your liquidity needs into our highly liquid, HFT-ready order book.

7. Growth strategy

7.1. Organic Growth Engine - Referrals, Affiliate Program

We acknowledge the fact that cryptocurrency trading is a low margin business, and thus, in addi-
tion to the means of generating organic traffic noted above, we focus heavily on organic growth
and referrals.

Because of this every user that trades on the platform is asked to spread the word directly at
the order page, in order to gain ‘free’ coins directly and instantly, sent to his order’s withdrawal
address.

For more professional affiliates, we offer multiple referral codes, with customisation, and per-code
segment analysis, as well as several other business intelligence (BI) tools that are offered in our
simple yet powerful affiliates panel.

7.2. Growth-Hacking

We are constantly looking to innovate an achieve a competitive edge over our competition.

AS part as those efforts we have enabled the trading of all competitor-exchange tokens, to attract
original crow-sale participants as well as secondary market buyers, to our platform and ICO, which
operates under similar, enhanced principles.

We target high-quality exchange aggregators, specifically those capable of API integrations from
which to source traffic. Aggregator operators, as well as their customers, find merit in our compet-
itive rates, robust and comprehensive API and guaranteed, fixed price.

Additionally, we support fiat purchasing of any coin that is supported by our platform, this helps
us source free traffic from the communities of those coins.

Whilst those are only two examples, we pride ourselves in being able to generate the industry's
top ratio of traction-pre-buck, one that we plan to keep improving after completing this round of
funding.

7.3. White Labelling & Liquidity Sourcing

At present, n.exchange already operates more than a dozen white-labels worldwide. To qualify as
a white label a partner needs to demonstrate a certain competitive edge over the original product,
as a means for a better adaptation/localisation to a geographic/demographic or any other market
segment which n.exchange does not target directly.

We are working on several verticals to increase our liquidity, as well as to obtain official regula-
tory compliance and thus, to source our liquidity to blue-chip financial institutions interested in
crypto-liquidity.

7.4. API integrations, labs

n.exchange encourages the community to take part in developing integrations for our API. For
this purpose we have open-sourced our frontend under the Apache 2.0 license, and implemented
several example to possible use cases to our API, such as the unique crypstor.com trading chat-bot.

Whilst our internet use cases on the API are quite straight forward, the only limit on what can be

implemented, with your multi-purpose API, is your imagination.

To provide an additional incentive for the community to participate in our development process,

we would dedicate 15% of our development fund to the community:

@ 10% via labs.n.exchange, a community-based accelerator

@ 5% via hackathons, other events and grants

7.5. Inbound Marketing

In conjunction with our exchanges, liquidity services, mining pool and merchant solution, we offer
a line of complementary services to bring added value to our customers and generate constant,

recurring, high-quality and zero-cost inbound traffic.

Those complementary services include, among others:

@ A blog with selected high quality content

@ An objective cryptocurrency capitalisation tracker, taking into consideration the bids on the
various markets, rather than just the last price multiplied by supply (which is inflated)

@ An integrated portfolio tracker that uses our API for liquidity, and is compatible with the
rest of our components, but can be used either manually by entering balances or addresses
to monitor, or via the API of the industry’s leading services

7.6. Partnerships
Companies are inclined to partner-up with n.exchange for several main reasons:

@ Wide support and instant liquidity for popular assets that, at times are not traded
elsewhere (Such as tokens of other exchanges)

@ An easy gateway for purchasing any of the supported coins with fiat, via credit card

@ Our robust API provides a comprehensive toolbox for creating payment services based
on crypto

The above incentives help us partner up with new leading coins every week, and to source free

traffic from their social networks via partnership announcements, status shares, and retweets.

7.7. Paid Traffic

Considering all of the above, and as with any product in the industry, more than 50% of our traffic
is paid. However, the variety of our services and our enhanced purchasing power allows us to ne-
gotiate custom deals with various industry-specific display networks, thus reducing the Customer
Acquisition Cost (CAC) and increasing the margin between it and the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).

ViptoCoin
Securing the Future

Introduction

Are our private lives really “private” anymore? With our personal Identification, the most sensitive
information about ourselves, being readily accessed by multiple corporations and online entities, often
without our knowledge, it is truly difficult to perceive as such. Your identification is largely entwined with
your privacy and should not be disclosed unless it is absolutely necessary. Cryptocurrency eliminates
the need for identification from both parties, ensuring true security.

Since the official revelation of blockchain technology: a system of recording information in a way that
makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system, which took place in 2008,
cryptocurrency has become a household name across the world, decorating multiple forums and
media.

Although, it has been challenged with minor setbacks in public actualization, such as the December
2017 fever pitch, cryptocurrencies have continued to attract the public and investors alike. Today, some
cryptocurrencies have grown by more than 200 percent in value, with some set to exceed the 1000th
percentiles.

According to recent studies done by Statista, 35 million parties participated in the cryptocurrency
market in 2018 and this number has increased to a staggering 101 million in 2020. This represents a
growth of 188 percent. While the global use of cryptocurrency has yet to achieve mainstream
acceptance, financial projections indicate that over a 100 thousand merchants currently accept and
trade virtual currencies as a formal mode of payment.

An Overview of ViptoCoin

Blockchain technology fulfills multiple purposes such as data storage, payments and operations, with
widespread creative utility. We believe that developments in blockchain technology will play an
important role as a determinant of the future, as the features of transparency and traceability that
blockchain technology is derived from are highly sought after and anticipated to build trust.

ViptoCoin is a fully open-source, community-based cryptocurrency project that was derived from a
blockchain built entirely on the NIST5 algorithm, from the ground-up. ViptoCoin is therefore geared to
ensure swift and secure transactions at nearly zero-transaction cost.

The blockchain on which ViptoCoin was developed and initialized on, is not only bountiful with features
but also stable and reliable - making it an ideal platform for developers to innovate and redefine as
ViptoCoin adopts more mainstream usage.

There are currently 186 million premined ViptoCoins in existence: this is mined purely from the genesis
block and the first 2 blocks, which seek to confirm the genuineness of the genesis block.

As of now, ViptoCoin is deemed a fully-operational public cryptocurrency. However, it is an ongoing
development project and is subject to further review, innovation, and improvements in every aspect.
> Mission

transactions at a low cost by leveraging blockchain technology.

> Attributes

- Fast and Secure Transactions.
-  Eco-friendliness.
- — Efficient Frameworks.

- Decentralized and distributed.

> Investor Benefits
An investment in ViptoCoin, is an investment in an eco-friendly, economically decentralized

cryptocurrency, ViptoCoin and the entire infrastructure that exists behind its development
project.

Methodology and Approach

ViptoCoin is a community-centric cryptocurrency project that aims to create a future-proof
environment powered by transparency, autonomy and empowerment. ViptoCoin, as a cryptocurrency
project, is backed by an entire community of like-minded and dedicated individuals, whose shared
goals include the eventual realization of the aforementioned vision.
Technology Behind the Project

The Algorithm

Security is the primary cornerstone of ViptoCoin. It was built from scratch on the NIST5 algorithm,
which has a proven track-record on security implementations. The NIST5 algorithm was developed by
pairing the best traits of the five finalist algorithms of SHA-3. These features were acclaimed by the
National Institute of Standards and Technology of America. In terms of functionality, the NIST5
algorithm, as applied in ViptoCoin, perpetually chooses the most beneficial characteristics of each
component algorithm in order to deliver maximum output, in performance, security and efficiency.

These five component algorithms of NIST5 include:

1. BLAKE
2. Grestl
3. JH

4. Keccak
5.

Properties of the Blockchain

The NIST5 is a hash algorithm with a heavy core that can be mined using consumer-grade hardware
such as entry-level CPUs and GPUs. The blockchain of ViptoCoin uses a customized version of the NIST5
algorithm, and its properties are as follows:

°o Maintenance of platform security.

°o Improvement of the platform’s usability.

°o Application to new exchanges.

Fast Payments

ViptoCoin (VCC) transactions occur speedily fast - making near-instantaneous transactions.
Once the transaction is confirmed in the blockchain, the received amount becomes available
for use. This confirmation process takes no longer than a few minutes.

Environment Conscious: Conserving without Compromise

The NIST5 algorithm relies on significantly less energy to operate when compared to its
counterparts. The conservative aspects of NIST5 have earned the algorithm a solid reputation
as a sustainable option for the deployment of systems that are based on blockchains, for it
conserves resources without compromising the security of members on the network.

> PayVipto

> Cross-platform Connectivity

PayVipto is a community driven payment solution for merchants devised to make transactions
seamless and efficient for both the merchant and customer. The codebase that powers PayVipto
enables a centralized payment facility that are connected to plugins that share cross-platform
connectivity with leading e-commerce platforms such as Shopify, Magento, and WooCommerce to
name a few.

> Buy and Sell with PayVipto

The PayVipto system therefore, allows merchants to receive payments, in the form of VCC in exchange
for their goods and services, by simply installing the PayVipto plugin onto their preferred e-Commerce
platform. Once the customer chooses VCC as their payment method, the plugin will then convert the
relevant fiat value of the selected good or service into ViptoCoin. It is tabulated by referencing the
latest official ViptoCoin price data. The customer will then be presented with a payment address
along with a QR code.

Once the PayVipto system detects the payment initiation, it will send a validation call to the
merchant's website and route the relevant ViptoCoin value through the PayVipto system to obscure
the final payment address. Thus, ensuring confidentiality and security, which provides additional
easement to merchants who plan on shifting to the PayVipto system.

> Simple and Easy to Use

The plugin is not only simple and easy to use, as it also provides merchants with meticulous
customizability, allowing them to customize the plugin to fit their own needs. This includes the option
of including their own code, via the PayVipto API that is integrated onto the merchant's individual
payment page.

The following page shows a chart that illustrates various building blocks of the PayVipto system.

> Atomic Swaps

Atomic swaps, alternatively known as atomic cross-chain trading, allows two parties to trade tokens
from two different blockchains. They are automatic exchange contracts that eliminate the need for
centralized third-party entities when executing trades.

> Whyuse Atomic Swaps?

The current cryptocurrency market is congested, with more cryptocurrencies being developed every
day. The sheer number of cryptocurrencies make the task of exchanging currencies more
complicated for those who are thorough with cryptocurrency.

In addition, there is also the looming concern of the absence of an option to reverse a slip up, should a
miscalculation occur during a transaction. The potential result? A major loss. This calls for a trusted
third-party service to ensure that both sides of a transaction receive a proper resolution, within the
trading protocols of crypto exchange.

“Atomic Swaps is our solution to this problem.”

ViptoCoin generates a hash-time-locked contract - a payment wherein the receiver is required to
acknowledge the receipt of the payment before a preset time or deadline. This is done by using
automatic swap architecture. This contract pairs multi-signature addresses and time-locks to
secure the transaction at a mutually agreed price point.

A two-party cryptocurrency that uses atomic swap can simultaneously occur on different
blockchains. A shared private code reinforces the security of the atomic swap. The transaction will
only be realized with the usage of a shared private code by both parties. Only a private code that is
shared by both parties can realize the transaction. The transaction will fail if either of the parties
enter an incorrect code - resulting in the return of funds to the original sender. The shared private
code therefore, removes the need for third-party intervention.

EXCHANGE OF ONE CRYPTOCURRENCY TO ANOTHER
CRYPTOCURRENCY WITHOUT THE NEED TO TRUST A THIRD PARTY

> Without Atomic Swaps

Imagine ordering an ice-cream at a diner that only accepts bitcoin as the mode of payment. Now,
let's picture the complex series of operations that must occur for the transaction to take place.

1. Access an exchange platform

2. Send the agreed VCC amount to be exchanged
3. Sell VCC for Bitcoin

4. Open a Bitcoin wallet application

5. Transfer Bitcoin to wallet from the exchange

6. Wait for the Bitcoin transaction to confirm

7. ‘Promptly’ pay for your (melted) ice cream

Now, imagine how inefficient our day-to-day lives can get, if the time it takes to pay for your ice-
cream, takes away the reason you wanted it in the first place. Which clearly, is far from satisfactory.

> With Atomic Swaps
Now, let's rewind the same scenario back to the beginning, only this time, we will enable atomic swaps.

1. Open the ViptoCoin application

2. Scan the QR code of Bitcoin

3. Confirm the payment within the application
4. Enjoy your (frosty cold) ice cream

Not only does atomic swaps save you valuable time but it also simplifies the transaction
drastically. Thus, eliminating the need to check what cryptocurrency is accepted by the shop.

Both, the VCC-blockchain and the non-VCC blockchain would need to confirm the transaction.
If not, the VCC will return to the original wallet.

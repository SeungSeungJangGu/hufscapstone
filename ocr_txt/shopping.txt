Abstract
Crypto & Shopping

Cryptocurrency and digital assets have
recorded unprecedented growth over
the course of the last few years. Evolving
from a simple internet based currency
with no inherent value, the cryptocurren-
cy market has grown into a complete in-
dustry with new projects emerging each
day and having a combined valuation of
over 550 Billion Dollars as of December
2020. However, despite its phenomenal
growth, real-life use of cryptocurrencies
is minimal, as they are mainly used for

trading and speculating only.

Shopping.io, a Blockchain-based plat-
form from AZ EXPRESS RETAIL LLC,
strives to change this entirely by offe-
ting a unified marketplace that com-
bines all major e-commerce industry
players under one website and enables
digital assets to be used as payment
method. With the technology infrastruc-
ture offered by Shopping.io, digital asset
(currently top100 as per coinmarketcap)

would now be able to be used across

major eCommerce marketplaces while
their holders can enjoy free shipping and
up to 10% discounts, without even ha-
ving to create individual accounts on the
respective eCommerce websites.

This Whitepaper gives a detailed de-
scription of our research and planning.
It also aims to demonstrate the current
status and future plans of the Shop-
ping.io platform, its associated pro-
ducts and solutions and SPI token—the
native token of the Shopping.io eCom-
merce platform deployed on the Ethere-
um Blockchain network. The document
strives to inform our readers how we are
using our teams’ expertise to provide
a unified and cryptocurrency enabled
eCommerce marketplace at lower costs,
minimal fee with higher speed, efficien-

cy, and higher returns.
Background

Cryptocurrency & Convers

.

In the recent few years, the cryptocurrency
industry has recorded significant growth—
peaking at USD 800 Billion in December 2017
while fluctuating around USD 550 Billion cur-
rently, as of December 2020. It was expected
to bring a whole new dimension in creating
value, and given the potential, this market
sector has got, cryptocurrencies were hoped
to disrupt the traditional method of shopping
and payment processing. However, when it
comes to real life usage, consumers regularly
face the same problem: a place where they
can use such cryptocurrencies or how can
they easily convert the cryptocurrencies they

hold into fiat currency?

Accepting, verifying, and processing cryp-
tocurrency payments is still rocket science

for many website owners, merchants, and

on

consumers. Whether it's because of the
volatility of cryptocurrencies or just the fact
that the technology is still new, major plat-
forms like Amazon, eBay, and Walmart do
not accept cryptocurrency for payments.
Consequently, consumers are looking
for more comfortable, more secure, and
cost-effective ways to shop online, as pay-
ment through traditional payment proces-
sors—both fiat and crypto— is still expensi-

ve and insecure.

This changes entirely with Shopping.io, a
Blockchain-based platform that strives to

revolutionize modern-age online shopping

by unifying all major eCommerce players
and enabling digital assets as a payment
method. In the section below, we introduce

the Shopping.io platform in detail.

Introduction

State of the art platform

Shopping.io is a state of the art platform that unifies all
major eCommerce platforms, allowing consumers to enjoy
online shopping seamlessly, securely, and cost-effectively.

It serves as the bridge between the cryptocur-
rency world and the physical world to satisfy
consumers who previously couldn't shop whi-
le using their digital assets. With the techno-
logy infrastructure offered by Shopping.io,
digital asset users (currently top100 as per
coinmarketcap) would now be able to shop
across their favorite major eCommerce mar-
ketplaces and enjoy free shipping and up to
10% discounts, without even having to create
individual accounts on the respective
eCommerce websites.

Shopping.io provides an efficient, Block-
chain-based payment processer without com-
promising security. The Shopping.io Platform
will serve as the next generation eCommerce
marketplace and payment processor. As a
commodity that is not bound to any geogra-
phic restrictions or national borders, the SPI
Coin strives to connect the real world with

cryptocurrencies through future-oriented pro-

ducts and services.

Shopping.io will not have a dedicated payment
coin. The native token; SPI will only be used as
a utility token, use case currently granting dis-
counts and other advantages. Payments will
be accepted via other coins that would serve
as multiple payment gateways, enabling effi-
cient payment processing, remittance engine,
social media tipping integration, smart cont-
ract-based escrow manager, and enabling the
transfer of value through mobile app and the
desktop wallet directly to the desired user. It
will strive to fully harness the Blockchain tech-
nology to allow seamless buying and selling
of products through various cryptocurrencies,
without having the involvement of a third par-
ty. It will address the issue of conversion and
liquidity by enabling consumers to spend their
tokens directly through the platform.
About us
Online environment

Shopping.io is a registered business entity under the name _ of
AZ Express Retail LLC 4281 Express In Sarasota, FL 34249.

The leadership team consists of industry experts from the eCom-
merce sector, banking sector, experienced programmers and de-
velopers, designers, marketing specialists, and accounting experts.
With Shopping.io, the leadership team aims to resolve problems fa-
ced by consumers through the provision of a decentralized eCom-

merce based marketplace powered by Blockchain technology.

The management at Shopping.io believes that the underlying factor that
will continue to define Blockchain products is the ability to give people
and businesses more power and control over their finances. This is the
driving force behind Shopping.io, i.e., providing a platform to the people
where they can freely utilize their crypto assets ina fully secure, seamless,
and affordable online environment and also providing them with oppor-
tunities in the form of discounts to earn lucrative earning in a seamless,
risk-free environment. To execute our mission, we intend to solve some
of the fundamental problems that a daily user has to face while execu-

ting a payment or doing an eCommerce transaction using digital assets.

007
Our Vision

eCommerce Marketplace a

We envision to streamline the process of online shopping by enab-
ling consumers to shop across a unified eCommerce Marketplace,
whereby they will get quality products in a transparent, seamless
manner at cost-effective rates while using digital assets of their choice,
without having to compromise on quality, security, and authenticity.

008
Our Mission
Blockchain Platform

Our mission is to become the leading eCommerce marketplace
of choice for sellers and buyers for digital asset users. We strive to
develop a platform that harnesses the power of technolo-
gy offered by Blockchain, Smart Contracts, and Cryptography.
Our mission is to enable digital asset holders to have a place where-
by they can utilize their crypto assets seamlessly and cost-effectively.
Problems & Our Solution
Blockchain platform

Data ownership

On any given eCommerce platform, a consumer is required to cre-
ate an account and provide his credentials such as name, address
and credit card/banking information. However, ownership of ever-
ything on the page belongs to the eCommerce platform. Moreover,
sales information and user behavior patterns stored on eCom-
merce platforms can also be used for unequal competition with

selling similar products.

With Shopping.io, a user is not required to create an account on
any eCommerce platform he is shopping on. Just by logging into
their SP] Account, they can search for any item on their favorite
eCommerce marketplace and paste the link on SPI Portal which
will automatically place the order for consumer once the respective
amount in cryptocurrency has been deposited. It is important to
note that the transactions are performed on an immutable and se-
cured by trustless smart contracts which ensure they are released
only once the delivery is made.

Over pricing

Prices on Amazon and other eCommerce platforms may appear
low. But this is only because the other point of reference we can
compare to is brick and mortar stores, which have huge costs to
keep the store open, and thus need to charge a bit more for the
products they sell. But as mentioned above, the eCommerce world
has a ton of hidden fees on the retailer-side that end up getting
passed to the consumer. No store, online or physical, is going to

sell a product without making a profit.

Shopping.io believes in a business model that is more custo-
mer-oriented rather than focused on gaining corporation gains. The
platform has a philosophy of making lives of people easier by allo-
wing them to shop at better rates while also offering them 5-10%
discount when holding 1000-2000 SPI Tokens.

0010
Dispute Resolution

The process of dispute resolution in traditional eCom-
merce platforms, in case of bad consumer experience with
a merchant, is hectic, time-consuming and often biased. A
consumer has to wait for days for the customer support to re-
spond, wherein majority cases the customer plea for product

replacement or order cancellation is even rejected.

Instead of relying on traditional escrow and hiring a particular
representative for dispute resolutions, Shopping.io would use
dedicated Smart Contracts which will record mutual agreed
set of rules before the placement of an order. Once the order
has been delivered, the Smart Contracts based on Al will as-
sess whether mutually agreed a set of rules are followed or
not. Upon successful execution of an order, funds would be

released to the respective retailer.

Insecurity for the consumer

Investment in cybersecurity is growing year on year, due to
the increasing number of threats to governments, companies,
and businesses internationally. Far from being oblivious to this
problem, eCommerce is forced to exercise extreme caution.
The processing of purchases requires the sending of sensitive
consumer information, which must be protected. Online custo-
mers are increasingly aware of the importance of security,
and therefore demand guarantees. Unfortunately, a part of the
eCommerce fails in this sense. Sometimes they even violate

users’ rights.

Our implementation of a combination of private hyper-led-
ger chain combined with public Ethereum Blockchain-based
decentralized business model will essentially allow differing
degrees of access to a given asset. All payments are secu-
red through smart contracts while the platform and its review
model and user data are secured through Blockchain. All user
data is encrypted and stored on a decentralized Blockchain
network. Moreover, we use security protocols SSL and comply
with the standards of Payment Card Industry Data Security

Standard (PCI DSS), among other measures.

Delayed Shipments

We know that logistics and timely delivery of products hold
paramount importance in the successful execution of mo-
dern age eCommerce and customer satisfaction. Shopping.io
uses Blockchain to create an incorruptible visualization of the
supply chain process. The Shopping.io will use a Blockchain
network to provide a transparent supply chain where consu-
mers can see the order flow of the products they buy, helping
increase consumer confidence, this way not only enhancing
the logistics and supply chain process but also making the
delivery time shorter.

0011
Standout Features

deal across all major eCommerce plat-

forms.

holding or staking atleast 2000 SPI
Tokens.

Free Shipping

for Starter/Pro package users

100 Cryptocurrencies
Trustless Order Execution

With Shopping.io, consumers would be entitled to get
up to 10% discounts when they hold/stake 2000 SPI Tokens.

Borderless

The Shopping.io Platform serves as a
global eCommerce marketplace. It is
decentralized and not limited to any
geographic limitations or restrictions. Its
native token i.e. SPI Token is not bound
to any borders as it acts as a universal
utility token across the Shopping.io
Platform.

Decentralization

Shopping.io is a completely decentrali-
zed eCommerce platform where control
lies with users, as the infrastructure has
been deployed on the Blockchain th-
rough tokenization and decentralization
of the business model. Furthermore, this
would ensure that all data across the
platform remains immutable, as it is ne-
arly impossible to hack, alter or corrupt

data on the Blockchain.

Trustless Order Execution

By implementing smart contracts based
technology, mutually set agreements or
orders across the marketplace would be
recorded on a decentralized Blockchain
(an immutable ledger) that can never be al-
tered or corrupted. This way, the role of the
middle man is eliminated and a big share
that was previously taken by intermediari-
es is retained to the users.

Incentivized Reviews

All consumers who complete a certain or-
der on our platform are eligible for a free
review and rating the product they have
received. To encourage the review pro-
cess, we are incentivizing the rating pro-
cedure by rewarding the reviewers with a
certain number of tokens once. It is here
to be noted that no fake reviews are allo-
wed and a retailer asking for fake reviews
or fake orders only to uplift their rankings

would be screened and penalized.
SPI Token Features
Cryptographically secured

SPI Token

is a cryptographically secured, Ethereum  Blockchain

deployed token that works as the native currency of the Shopping.io

financial ecosystem. Some of the salient features of this token include :

Mobile

With fiat currencies, it is difficult to carry
around large amounts of money. Cash
amounting to millions is risky to carry
for several reasons and even not allowed
while traveling abroad. With SPI Token,
you can easily carry around a million
dollars’ worth of Coins directly in your
mobile phone.

Fast

Shopping.io eCommerce marketplace
utilizes blockchain technology for the fi-
nancial transactions which enables near
to zero cost financial transactions, high
security standards, User friendly wallets,
and an overall amazing customer expe-
rience. Transactions are quick and easy,

sending or spending.

0014

Trust and transparency

Shopping.io eCommerce marketplace
being deployed on a public blockchain
brings transparency in transactions,
which fosters trust. Every transaction is
recorded in a shared ledger and cannot
be modified by anyone. It offers high-se-
curity, radical visibility, and faster pro-
cessing speed, along with traceability

through the decentralized system.

Cost-effectiveness

eCommerce sellers can rely on SPI To-
ken to avail cost-effective digital pay-
ment solutions. Since there are no pay-
ment processes or third parties involved
in a crypto-transaction, SPI cannot be

used to buy from the website.

Secure

The Shopping.io Platform uses Block-
chain based transactions which are
immutable. In the event that a block is
altered, the block would be rejected by
most of the nodes and the information
would not persist in the ledger. This is
because the block is hashed using the
hash of the previous block which would
link the blocks together and creating a
chain. If a block is altered the data would
also affect the hash for the subsequent
block which in turn causes the nodes in
the network to reject it. This ensures that
the information has not been tampered
with which would ensure eCommerce
ecosystems for customers, suppliers,
sellers, and shipping companies to
highly protected.

Private

The Shopping.io Platform ensures that
all user data is kept as private and en-
crypted, something that only the user

Can access.

Sales in billions

Market Overview
B2C

For private consumers around the globe the most well-known form of eCommerce
falls into the business to consumer (B2C) category, which includes online retail or on-
line shopping. It refers to online purchases from bricks-and-mortar retailers, such
as Walmart, as well as from web-only online retailing corporations such as Amazon.
com or Rakuten. In 2018, an estimated 1.8 billion people worldwide purchase goods
online10. During the same year, global e-retail sales amounted to 2.8 trillion
U.S. dollars11 and projections show a growth of up to 4.8 trillion U.S. dollars by 2021.

0016
This statistic gives information on retail
eCommerce sales worldwide from 2014 to
2021. In 2017, retail eCommerce sales wor-
Idwide amounted to 2.3 trillion US dollars
and e-retail revenues are projected to grow
to 4.88 trillion US dollars in 2021. Online
shopping is one of the most popular online
activities worldwide but the usage varies by
region - in 2016, an estimated 19% of all re-
tail sales in China occurred via internet but
in Japan the share was only 6.7%.

Desktop PCs are still the most popular de-
vice for placing online shopping orders but
mobile devices, especially smartphones,
are catching up.

In recent years, mobile shopping has been
on the rise, with customers increasingly
using their mobile devices for various on-
line shopping activities. As of the fourth
quarter of 2018, desktop PCs accounted for
approximately the same amount of global
e-retail orders as smartphones. However,
smartphones were the number one device
in terms of retail website visits. During a

2017 survey, 11% of online shoppers stated
that they shopped online via smartphone on
a weekly basis.

The average online shopping and purchase
intention rates among online shoppers also
vary strongly by product category - clothing,
shoes and consumer electronics were the
most popular online shopping categories
worldwide. Average shopper spending per
visit was - unsurprisingly - highest in the lu-
xury apparel vertical.

Amazon.com is one of the most popular and
well-known example of an online shopping
platform. Founded in 1995, the Seattle-ba-
sed site started out as an online bookstore,
but soon began expanding its product ran-
ge towards other retail goods and consu-
mer electronics. The online company con-
sistently ranks among the top ten leading
retailers worldwide - online and offline. On-
line retailers are the most popular starting
point for first-time14 purchasers but online
marketplaces are more attractive for repeat
buyers.

Digital buyers in billion

Market Overview
B2C

This timeline displays a forecast of the number of digital buyers worldwide from 2014.
to 2021. In 2021, over 2.14 billion people worldwide are expected to buy goods and
services online, up from 1.66 billion global digital buyers in 2016.

0018
Digital buyers worldwide Purchasing goods
and services online has become a common
practice among many people around the
world. Some choose to make online purcha-
ses for convenience, others because of the
competitive price offered by some eCom-
merce platforms. Digital buyers can also be
influenced by a range of digital resources
when shopping, such as brand emails and
product reviews. Reasons to purchase asi-
de, the number of digital buyers is on the
rise. PayPal is the preferred payment me-
hod amongst online shoppers worldwide,
as more than 40% of online shoppers af-
firmed using this method. The traditional

credit card ranks second with a 31% usage
rate, followed by debit cards. The range of
devices with internet connections available
to online shoppers allows products to be
purchased almost anywhere from any de-

vice. During the last quarter of 2016, online
orders which were placed from a tablet had
an average value of 106.98 U.S. dollars, whi-
le orders from PC devices averaged 143.35
U.S. dollars. In the U.S., online shopping is

expected to remain popular in the future, as
the country is one of the leading online re-
tail markets ranked by online shopper reach
with growth projections for the next years.
About 80% of internet users in the U.S. are
expected to make at least one purchase on-
line during the calendar year in 2019, a signi-
ficant increase from 2013, when this share
stood at 73%.

As per the above discussion, the potenti-
al for growth of the eCommerce sector is
unprecedented. Popular eCommerce plat-
forms like Amazon, eBay, and Alibaba have
changed the way we live and shop. The con-
venience, option to order and get things at
home, and a huge variety of available pro-
ducts are only a few of the major benefits
that eCommerce platforms offer consu-
mers. And with the addition of cryptocurren-
cy being accepted as a payment method,
Shopping.io has a market segment of over 1
Trillion Dollar eCommerce and digital asset
market to target.

The regulatory status of tokens and distributed ledger techno-
logy is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to
predict how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing
regulation with respect to such technology and its applications,
including the Shopping.io Marketplace and SPI Tokens. It is li-
kewise difficult to predict how or whether legislatures or regula-
tory agencies may implement changes to laws and regulations
affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications,
including the Shopping.io Marketplace and SPI Tokens. Regula-

tory actions could negatively affect the Shopping.io Marketpla-

ce in various ways, including, for purposes of illustration only,

through a determination that the purchase, sale, and delivery of

SPI Tokens constitutes unlawful activity or that SPI Tokens are

a regulated instrument that requires registration or the licen-
sing of some or all of the parties involved in the purchase, sale,

and delivery thereof. The Shopping.io Marketplace may cease
operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions,
or changes to laws or regulations, make it illegal to operate
in such jurisdiction or commercially undesirable to obtain the

necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.

Given that SPI Tokens are based on the Ethereum protocol, any
malfunction, breakdown, or abandonment of the Ethereum pro-
tocol may have a material adverse effect on SPI Tokens. Mo-
reover, advances in cryptography or technical advances, such
as the development of quantum computing, could present risks
to SPI Tokens and the Shopping.io Marketplace, including the
utility of SPI Token by rendering ineffective the cryptographic
consensus mechanism that underpins the Ethereum proto-
col. As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens based

on the Ethereum protocol, SPI Tokens are susceptible to atta-

cks by miners in the course of validating SPI Token transac-
tions on the Ethereum Blockchain, including, but not limited

to, double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, and
selfish-mining attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk
to the Shopping.io Marketplace and SPI Tokens, including but
not limited to, accurate execution and recording of transactions

involving SPI Tokens.

contractors and representatives do not have any responsibility
or liability to any person or recipient (whether by reason of neg-
ligence, negligent misstatement or otherwise) arising from any

out of, contained in or derived from or omission from this paper.

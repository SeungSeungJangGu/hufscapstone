1. Spot-trading & Cashback on the trading fees

The main source of profit for the EXMO Cryptocurrency Platform is the
commission from trading operations. Our team offers the following
incentive system to our active users: up to 70% less trading fees,
depending on the user's trading volume.

The Cashback system implies a progressive discount scale on trading fees.
Users with a trading volume of over 100,000 USD (over the last 30 days)
unlock the ability to get back a percentage of their trading fees.

In order to motivate users to increase the level of liquidity in exchanges
market depth, the Cashback system provides different levels of the
trading commission return, depending on the trade operations
classification on "Maker” and- “Taker” principle.

More specifically, an executed limit order (Maker transaction) is awarded
double the cashback of an executed market order (Taker transaction).

The Cashback is calculated daily based on the trading volume of
maker-taker transactions. As an order executes, the system automatically
credits the rebated amount to the trader. The trading fee is calculated
and paid in the traded currency.

v.1.0 / July 2019
2. Referral (Affiliate) Program

Our referral (affiliate) program works to incentivize the growth of the
exchange's user base. Each user of the EXMO Cryptocurrency Platform
can set up their own affiliate network to refer new traders to the
exchange and earn rewards for all of their trades.

The user (referrer) can generate their own unique referral link and share it
with potential users (referrals) to register on the EXMO Cryptocurrency
Platform.

Any trade completed by the referral earns a fixed percentage for the
referrer, deducted from the trading fee.

3. The Listing System

The EXMO Cryptocurrency Platform offers its users access to the hottest
assets in the cryptocurrency market. By running promising projects, coins
and tokens through a comprehensive selection process, offering robust
technical support, performing rigorous analysis of regulatory
requirements and risks, and reviewing feedback from our community,
EXMO employs a cutting-edge listing system that reflects the market and
its trends.

4. Initial Exchange Offering (IEO)

The Initial Exchange Offering refers to a token sale conducted on the
exchange. The key difference between an IEO and the traditional ICO
model is that the exchange acts as the facilitator. The exchange's team
conducts a preliminary audit and technical analysis of the project and
their token, appraises the project's potential and investment appeal, and
only then announces the start of a token sale on the platform.

—w/74 EXMO EXMO Coin (EXM) Whitepaper 6
v.1.0 / July 2019
5. EX-CODE

EX-CODE is the “native currency” of the EXMO platform. It allows users to
preserve or transfer any financial instrument outside the exchange.

EX-CODE is an encrypted combination of symbols, empowering the users
to generate, send or accept codes in any currency available on EXMO.

6. The Online Exchange Chat

Users of the EXMO Cryptocurrency Platform can communicate with each
other in real time, share the latest market trends, exchange opinions and
discuss trading strategies. Moreover, the exchange chat is the best way to
get the latest news of any platform innovations, changes of the fee
structures, project listings and other relevant events.

Development

1. Margin Trading

Margin trading refers to the practice of using borrowed funds with the
trader's own funds being used as collateral. Naturally, in return for the
opportunity to trade with margin, the platform charges the trader
commission for using borrowed funds.

The EXMO Cryptocurrency Platform is hard at work creating a margin
trading system built around security and risk-management for its users.
Following a comprehensive analysis and technical testing, in the very near
future we expect to offer our users the ability to trade with leverage, open
long and short positions, allowing them to profit from the market,
whether the trend is bullish or bearish.

2. Complex Orders

An order is the primary tool of a trader on an exchange. An order allows
the user to perform trades, determine acceptable levels of gains and risks,
take profits and cut losses.

The most common types of orders are a limit order and a market order,
that cover the basic needs of most traders. However, building more

—w/74 EXMO EXMO Coin (EXM) Whitepaper 7
v.1.0 / July 2019
complex trading strategies require more sophisticated tools. These
include the ability to limit losses (e.g. Stop Loss), create a hidden order, set
execution parameters (execute fully or cancel, execute partially or cancel,
etc.), set a delayed order, or employ a strategy (Iceberg, TWAP, etc.). To
implement any of the above, complex orders become a necessity.

The EXMO Cryptocurrency Platform is pleased to announce the
implementation of the first in a series of complex orders, the stop-loss,
coming in Q3 2019. This will give traders flexibility in managing the risk of
losing their capital by limiting losses to acceptable levels.

3. Mobile App

With the main goal of the EXMO Cryptocurrency Platform in mind — to
be a portal into the world of cryptocurrencies — we aim to make this
window universal and untethered from the user's location. To this end,
we're finishing the development of our mobile app.

The mobile app will empower our users with all the main tools of the
exchange, allowing them to trade with nothing but their smartphone.

The mobile app will be available for iOS and Android users in the stores.

—w/74 EXMO EXMO Coin (EXM) Whitepaper 8
v.1.0 / July 2019
4. Copy Trading

The traditional form of copy trading is a manner of investing where
professional exchange traders allow newbies or traders with limited time
for trading to mirror all the trades performed by the professional. One way
that copy trading differs from investing with a financial consultant is that
the newbies don’t need to physically transfer their assets. Theirs capital
remains with them while the trades are mirrored to what the professional
trader is doing with his capital.

5. Cloud Mining

A series of strategic partnerships with major global manufacturers of
mining equipment, mining pools and providers of distributed hashing
power for cloud computing allows the EXMO Cryptocurrency Platform to
offer our users the ability to rent hashing power directly from our partners.

6. Voting Rights to List/Delist Assets on the Exchange

Community opinion is an important component to the business model of
the EXMO Cryptocurrency Platform, we want to earn the trust of our users
by listening and carefully considering their feedback. To this end, we plan
on adding a function to vote to have promising projects being listed on
the exchange.

On the one hand, new assets represent new investment opportunities. On
the other hand, they are fraught with certain risks. We always aim to
conduct a rigorous analysis of all projects considered for listing, but it's
possible that our specialists might overlook certain important details. By
giving a voice to our users, we'll be adding yet another quality assurance
step to the verification process.

Same goes for delisting. Sometimes projects fail to live up to expectations
and cease developing for one reason or another. In such a case, delisting
becomes a necessity. But since our users may be invested in the asset, the
decision is up to them, as well.

—w/74 EXMO EXMO Coin (EXM) Whitepaper 9
v.1.0 / July 2019
EXMO Coin

The Main Idea

EXMO Coin is a utility token for the exchange's internal ecosystem. As
such, we plan on integrating the token into many additional services as
we expand the platform. Conceptually, EXMO Coin is similar to that of
many other exchange tokens in the world of cryptocurrency trading: it
offers bonuses and advantages when utilizing the exchange's tools and
products while ensuring security and confidence in one's investment.

Legal Restrictions

EXMO Coin is in no way a direct or indirect analog of shares, participation
interests, liabilities, legal claims, legal titles or interests with respect to the

enterprise or institution, nor does EXMO Coin entitle its owners to any

affiliates, and is not a debt of the EXMO Cryptocurrency Platform or any of
its affiliates.

Ownership of EXMO Coin does not contain any rights, express or implied,
other than the right to use EXMO Coin as an instrument that can be used
to interact on the EXMO Cryptocurrency Platform.

EXMO Coin will also function as an economic incentive for users to
participate in the EXMO ecosystem.

Technical Parameters

EXMO Coin is issued on the Ethereum blockchain using the ERC20
standard as the smart contracts interface.

Why ERC20?

e Platform maturity

e Widespread and popular

e POW

e Large community

e Large amount of code ready for development
e Available token standards

e Large number of dApps on the platform

All ERC20 compatible tokens are supported by the majority of crypto
exchanges and wallets interfacing with the Ethereum network.

After the public token sale, we plan on launching the equivalent contract
on the TRON blockchain using the TRC20 standard and implementing the
ability to swap assets between the TRON and Ethereum blockchains.
Additionally, we plan on implementing atomic swaps between these
blockchains.

The token's smart contract is coded in Solidity.

The token is fully compliant with the international security standards
ISO/IEC 27001 and CryptoCurrency Security Standard (CCSS).

The Advantages of EXMO Coin

Following the initial placement of EXMO Coin tokens, the plan is to
integrate the token into the EXMO internal ecosystem, as well as execute
strategic partnerships with leading payment systems and cryptocurrency
wallets to integrate EXMO Coin into their respective systems and wallets.
In an effort to stimulate active use of the tokens on our platform, we plan
on gradually implementing a series of incentives, including but not
limited to:

1. Reduced trading fees

EXMO users will be able to increase their cashback rate, thereby reducing
their trading fees by up to 50%.

The package service will be paid in EXMO Coin and apply for the duration
of the chosen period.

Cost of increased cashback packages is as follows:

Cashback rate* Package cost**
Maker Taker 30 days
10% 5% 1 USD
25% 12,5% 10 USD
35% 17,5% 100 USD
50% 25% 500 USD

* - The cashback is calculated daily based on the trading volume of maker-taker transactions. As an
order executes, the system automatically credits the rebated amount to the trader. The trading fee is
calculated and paid in the traded currency. The payment is remitted the day following the completion
of the trade.

** - The service is paid in EXMO Coin at the current payment rate

Increased cashback starts at 00:00 UTC following the date of purchase
through 23:59 UTC of the last date of the purchased period.

The EXMO Cryptocurrency Platform reserves the right to amend the
terms of the service, including enabling/disabling the service at our
discretion, with advance notice to the exchange's users through official
channels.

—w/74 EXMO EXMO Coin (EXM) Whitepaper 3
v.1.0 / July 2019
2. Reduced margin trading fees

After launching margin trading on the EXMO Cryptocurrency Platform,
users will be given the option to pay for leveraged trades with EXMO
tokens.

Using EXMO tokens to pay for leveraged trades will be discounted as
compared to using the leveraged currency. The exact amount of the
discount will be determined after the function is implemented.

The number of EXMO tokens required to pay for the margin trade will be
calculated off the market rate of EXM to the leveraged currency (or off the
cross rate to BTC).

The service will be in effect from the moment it's activated in the user's
personal settings without expiration.

3. Copy successful traders

After launching copy trading as a service, users of the EXMO
Cryptocurrency Platform will be given the option to copy top traders with
EXMO tokens. The list of top traders, including details of their portfolios,
will be published on a dedicated page of the EXMO Cryptocurrency
Platform.

The service will be offered for purchase for a specific period.

4. Payments to access the cloud mining service

Users of the EXMO Cryptocurrency Platform will be given the option to
purchase hashing power from our partners with their EXMO tokens.

Details will be announced separately through official channels when the
service is implemented.

5. The priority listing of new cryptocurrencies and tokens
in pair with EXMO Coin

After the listing of new coins or tokens on the EXMO Cryptocurrency
Platform, they will be available for trading exclusively for 3 days (in pairs
with EXM).

—w/74 EXMO EXMO Coin (EXM) Whitepaper 14
v.1.0 / July 2019
At the conclusion of the three-day exclusive trading period, new coins or
tokens will be available for trading as a pair the other currencies.

6. Special access to the IEO platform

Users of the EXMO Cryptocurrency Platform will be granted access to
Initial Exchange Offerings that pass the selection process. IEOs will be
conducted in two pairs: with BTC (or other "traditional" currency) and with
EXMO Coin.

Note that using the EXMO Coin trading pair will qualify for a special
discount, set against 1 unit of the IEO asset. The size of the discount will be
set for each project individually.

7. Increased referral payouts

Users whose referrals complete trades with EXMO tokens on the
exchange will receive increased affiliate payouts for those operations.
Affiliate rates to be determined.

8. Airdrops

Users who hold certain amounts of EXMO Coin on the platform over
certain periods of time will be rewarded with partner airdrops during
various promotional events. Details of each partner promotion will be
announced separately.

The EXM Usability Roadmap

Integrating EXMO Coin into settlements system on the EXMO
Cryptocurrency Platform is designed to extend the token's influence.

Use of Raised Funds

t ) 40% / Technical development
@ 40%/ Marketing
© 10%/ Legal support

@ 10%/ Insurance fund

40% of raised funds — technical development:

One of the main goals in issuing EXMO Coin is to raise funds to accelerate
the development of our products. This development requires a significant
amount of work, the details of which are listed in the Upcoming section of
Our Products page. In an effort to accelerate the release of new
instruments for our users, we plan on allocating the majority of funds
raised precisely to strengthen our team of developments. Additionally, a
key direction of our technical program is ensuring the security of user
funds. To this end, we will be allocating a portion of the funds raised to
projects related to IT security, audits, and storage of assets.

40% — marketing:

A large portion of the raised funds will be used to promote the EXMO
brand on international markets. An aggressive marketing strategy will
include reduced trading fees (up to 50%), context-based advertising, and
so on. It's no secret that the main goal of any platform is to grow its user
base. We are serious about attracting new customers and maintaining
our reputation as a reliable cryptocurrency exchange.

10% — legal support:

Working with fiat currencies and reliable banks requires licenses. In order
to simplify the process for traders and wallet holders, we'll be allocating
10% of the raised funds for legal expenses and licensing fees. We believe
that regulatory compliance is key to reliable, projected growth.

10% — insurance fund:

0% of the raised funds will be allocated to an emergency insurance fund.
Blockchain technology is a relatively new and undeveloped innovation in
the world of modern information technologies. Despite the efforts made
by the major exchanges and players in the crypto industry, there are the

—w/74 EXMO EXMO Coin (EXM) Whitepaper 7
v.1.0 / July 2019
occasional emergency situations in which user funds are put at risk. In an
effort to protect our users from such losses, we have decided to create a
special insurance fund that would cover those losses in the event of such
force-majeure losses.

—w/74 EXMO EXMO Coin (EXM) Whitepaper 18
v.1.0 / July 2019
Token Utilization

Starting QI] 2020, all the tokens used for purchasing reduced trading fees
by way of an increased cashback rate (as a subscription) will be subject to
utilization.

Thus, every quarter the number of EXMO Coin tokens will decrease.

EXMO tokens subject to utilization will be kept in a separate public wallet
and burned every quarter rather than being put back into circulation.

Utilization will continue until the token supply is reduced to 50% of the
total circulating supply.

The Order of Token Sale

Placement of EXMO tokens will happen over several stages. At the first
stage, 50% of the total issued tokens will be sold. The remaining 50% will
be subject to a 3-year lockup to be partially unlocked every six months. A
portion (20%) of the total issued tokens will be distributed to the team and
used to cover operational expenses. The remaining 30% of the issued
tokens will be put on the open market in a public sale.

We plan on holding one private (closed) sale round and several public
open) rounds.

The private round will satisfy the demands of large investors interested in
our platform.

The public rounds (three in total) will be held as an open exchange
offering (IOE) on our platform. The first two public rounds will offer EXMO
tokens at a discount off the nominal price (see the Stages, Time Frames,
Price section for details on pricing).

As for the 50% of the issued tokens to be locked up for 3 years, we plan on
placing 1/6 of the initially locked-up tokens every six months. The
placement will take place openly on our platform using the IEO
mechanism.

—w/74 EXMO EXMO Coin (EXM) Whitepaper 19
v.1.0 / July 2019
Why an IEO?

The idea to issue a token for the exchange's internal infrastructure as an
IEO on our own platform was conceived as the most convenient and
profitable fundraising option—both for the exchange and for the token
investors. The EXMO exchange is directly connected to the world of
cryptocurrencies, working around-the-clock to develop product solutions
to make the cryptocurrency market as simple and as convenient as
possible for all our customers, without exception.

Our goal is to raise 2 000 BTC in stages. This will allow us to strengthen
our team of developers, build a more aggressive and widespread
marketing system, and meet the growing demand for sophisticated
instruments required for trading cryptocurrencies.

An influx of investment will allow us to grow our trading volume by orders
of magnitude, make it into the top 10 exchanges within 3 years, and
challenge the world's largest exchanges.

Over this period, our goal is to expand our suite of products and security
solutions, and deploy an aggressive marketing campaign to multiply our
trading volume by an order of 10.

Price, Rounds, Time Frames

Private Sale

A private pre-sale round is planned for the first stage of placement, where
a portion of the issued tokens will be offered to large investors via
individual requests.

Requests will be accepted through 23:59 GMT+3 July 1, 2019 via email at
exmocoin@exmo.com or via the feedback form found at

contract for the sale of digital assets, and will occur after getting requests
o from a potential buyers.

EXMO tokens purchased by the private individual during the private stage
will be delivered to the user’s EXMO Wallet.

EXM tokens acquired by an individual during the private sale are
subjected to be frozen for a period of 6 months from the date of purchase.

The first exchange EXMO token placement will be conducted for Bitcoin
(BTC) at the following price:

price of 1 token = nominal cost of 1 token (in BTC) * (1 - placement round
discount)

The placement price remains constant during the placement round.

The placement round will be deemed complete if 25% or more of the
planned amount is placed.

If the placement round is deemed incomplete (less than 25% of the
planned amount is placed), the EXMO Cryptocurrency Platform will buy
the placed tokens at their placement price during the round.

In the event of incomplete placement, the buyback will take place no
more than 30 calendar days from the completion of the round deemed
incomplete.

The buyback period will last 3 calendar days.

All the tokens subject to the buyback will be immediately burned.

Locked-up Tokens

The primary goal of locking up EXMO tokens is to attract additional
financing for the future development of the platform. As such, the EXMO
Cryptocurrency Platform considers these assets as reserve for
specific-purpose financing of its project program.

Following the initial placement of EXMO tokens (private stage and IEO
public rounds), the EXMO Cryptocurrency Platform will unlock % of the
locked EXMO tokens every six months, starting from the first half of 2020.

Unlocked EXMO tokens will either be offered up for exchange placement
on the EXMO Cryptocurrency Platform or burned without placement.

n the event of a decision to place an unlocked batch of tokens among
buyers on the open market, the EXMO Cryptocurrency Platform
undertakes to publish a comprehensive overview of the purpose of such
financing (the project, its description, its deadlines).

Starting from the first unlocking period and on, the EXMO Cryptocurrency
Platform reserves the right to cancel a token placement round. In sucha
case, the tokens scheduled for placement will be subject to immediate
utilization.

Participating in the sale of EXMO Coin, purchasing EXMO Coin and using
any services offered by EXMO is fraught with significant risks and
potential financial losses, including but not limited to:

Features, functions, parameters and other qualities of EXMO Coin
("EXMO Coin Qualities"), as well as software, networks, protocols,
systems and other technologies (including, if applicable, any
blockchain) ("Base Technology") used for administration, creation,
issuance, transfer, cancellation, utilization or processing of operations
involving EXMO Coin, may be technologically complex or difficult to
comprehend or assess.

EXMO Coin and its Base Technology may be vulnerable to attacks
targeting the security, wholeness or functionality of EXMO Coin or its
Base Technology ("Attack"), which may include Attacks employing
computing power sufficient to suppress normal operation of the
blockchain or another Base Technology.

EXMO Coin, EXMO Coin Qualities or Base Technology may change or
in one way or something cease functioning according to expectations
due to changes made to the Base Technology, changes made using
the features or functions embedded in the Base Technology, or
changes brought on by an Attack. These changes may include,
without limitation, "changes to the source code" or a "rollback" of
EXMO Coin or the blockchain.

EXMO Coin may be nullified, lost or spent, or lose most or all of its
value in some other way as a result of changes to the source code,
rollbacks, Attacks, changes to EXMO Coin Qualities or inability of
EXMO Coin to function as intended.

EXMO may pause or reject any order as part of the IEO and/or any
other transaction involving EXMO Coin following the conclusion of the

with applicable laws and regulations, or if instructed by law
enforcement or other governmental agencies, as well as other
reasons, at the discretion of EXMO.

factors, including discovery of unlawful behavior, market
manipulation, changes to EXMO Coin qualities or presumed value of
Token Qualities, Attacks, as well as other factors, including, among

lil Introduction of Bgogo Exchange

community, for the community. It is the first digital asset exchange with
supernode listing authority, designed to list the most high quality and promising
digital assets.

Bgogo.com is registered in Cayman Islands. Bgogo founders include members
from leading Internet companies such as Facebook, Twitter, IBM, Alibaba, etc.
The core engineering team consists of several world champions of the ACM
International Collegiate Programming Contest.

Figure 1. BGG Token Distribution
Token Sale

10% of the total supply (1 billion BGG tokens) will be sold for 15,000 ETH to the
founding generation of supernodes as well as strategic partners during the
private sale. The private sale price is 1 BGG = 0.000015 ETH. Each supernode is
granted an allocation of 500 ETH, totaling 10,500 ETH for all 21 supernodes.
The rest 4,500 ETH is raised from strategic investors as well as ecosystem
partners.

Token Unlock Schedule

50% of the total BGG token supply is reserved for rewards through trading over
a period of 4 years. There is a daily cap for tokens available for rewards. The
20% reserved for ecosystem developments and Bgogo daily operations will be
unlocked at the same rate of trading rewards. Team distribution will be vested
over 4 years, with 25% at the end of each year.

Meanwhile, Bgogo will update and post BGG token holding positions of all
supernodes on the website. This is an unprecedented case where an exchange
makes public its top token holders as well as their positions. This means that
any change in supernode positions will be seen by all platform users. We hope
to become a pioneer in promoting transparency in the cryptocurrency exchange
industry.
Trading Rewards

BGG tokens allocated towards trading rewards (50% of total supply) will be
reserved for users in the form of high-frequency trading fee rebates,
commonly known as DOUBLE trading rewards. A user's probability to earn
DOUBLE BGG trading fee rewards will depend on their BGG HODL Points (BGG
HP). Earnings will be available on the user's balance within 30 minutes.
DOUBLE Trading Rewards are calculated according to the market price of BGG
during a specific transaction. Rebates will be finalized and shall appear in the
user's balance within 30 minutes.

BGG HODL Points (BGG HP) is a score based on weighted BGG holdings that
appreciate 1% each day to emphasize the value of the BGG holding period. The
longer the user holds BGG, the higher their BGG HP.

A user's probability of earning the 2X reward will depend on their BGG HODL Points.

Probability Rank BGG HP 2X Rewards Chance
Tier 1 0-299,999 45%
Tier 2 300,000-2,999,999 50.5%
Tier 3 3,000,000+ 52%
Notes:

1. To avoid malicious manufactured trading, the number of BGG tokens
available for rewards will not exceed the daily cap. Any trades after the daily
cap is reached are not eligible for rewards. The total BGG available for rewards
will be capped daily over a span of four years (48 months).

Figure 2. BGG Reward Schedule

Please note that according to Figure 2, the total number of BGG tokens available for rewards
during the first 48-month period only add up to 4.7 billion. The remaining 300 million tokens
are reserved for rewards during ad-hoc adjustments - around 133 million will be mined
during the Genesis Mining event, and the other 167 million BGG tokens will be reserved for
provisions of unexpected trading demand by flexibly increasing the mining cap of that day.

2. To avoid malicious manufactured trading, Bgogo will implement a daily cap of
USD $50,000 per account in trade volume eligible for the fee rebate. Once the
daily cap is reached, traders will not be able to receive extra BGG tokens until the

following trading day starts.

3. Bgogo reserves the right to alter or discontinue the mining reward program prior

to the completion of the Genesis Mining event as affected by market status.
BGG Token Buyback

Every 24 hours, Bgogo will use 100% of the trading commissions revenue to
repurchase BGG. The buyback tokens will be sent to a burn address made public.

Trading fees are collected

ili! BGG Supernodes

Definition

There are 21 BGG supernodes. The founding generation of supernodes is
selected from leading cryptocurrency institutions across the globe. These
entities will participate in the BGG token private sale. Playing a key role in the
Bgogo ecosystem, each supernode is granted the "One Vote, One Listing" right
as well as the benefit of “20% Per-Trade Commission Share” over a lifetime.

Tenure

The tenure of each supernode is one quarter, i.e. roughly 90 days. At the end of
each quarter, Bgogo supernodes are re-elected based on the top 21 accounts in
BGG holding position (see supernode re-election mechanism). Supernodes are
required to pass KYC verification and subject to vetting by the team in order to
qualify. This is for the purpose of protection against potential violations of laws
and regulations.

One Vote, One Listing

Each supernode is entitled to "One Vote, One Listing" authority. This privilege
gives status holders the right to pick a cryptocurrency to list on the Bgogo
trading platform during its tenure. This is under the premise that the
cryptocurrency nominated passes legal qualifications and is approved to be
listed by the project team. In the event where multiple supernodes are
competing to list the same cryptocurrency, Bgogo will respect the project
team's decision of which supernode they choose to nominate them. Thus, a
total of 21 coins from supernodes should be listed during each quarter.
20% Per-Trade Commission Share

A fixed 20% of the commission generated over a lifetime from trading the
cryptocurrency a supernode nominates will be paid to the supernode.

Re-Election Mechanism

A daily snapshot of all individual accounts on our platform will be taken at
00:00 (UTC+8). This will be utilized as criteria for supernode re-election.
Based on the daily weighed calculation of BGG positions held in each account,
we will obtain a ranking of total BGG holdings in one quarter. The top 21
accounts of that ranking who pass KYC verification will be eligible to obtain
supernode status in the following quarter. If a prospective supernode is
ineligible or declines to undertake the status, the status will be granted to the
next BGG holder in-line as determined by the ranking of that quarter.

Supernodes receive 20% of
fees for sole-listing authority

Figure 4. BGG Supernodes Ecosystem
Duties & Responsibilities

1. Excluding the first generation supernodes, all supernodes starting from the
second generation are required to lock up their BGG balance during their
tenure.

2. Supernodes should perform due diligence and guarantee the authenticity,
reliability, legitimacy of the cryptocurrencies they choose to list. They are
encouraged to choose cryptocurrency that is highly recognized by the
communities and examine against false disclosures, business fraud, including
“pyramid” or Ponzi schemes. If any violations are discovered after listing,
Bgogo reserves the right to delist the cryptocurrency chosen by the supernode
and disqualify the supernode.

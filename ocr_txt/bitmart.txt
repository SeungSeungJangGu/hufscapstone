Project Background

BITMART

1. Project Background

Since Bitcoin was born in 2009, blockchain digital assets have been developing for nearly a
decade. Bitcoin was once known as digital gold and now its unit price has already surpassed
that of gold. What is more, market capitalization for the overall digital currency-related

industry has exceeded three hundred billion U.S. dollars, too.

More recently, blockchain digital assets have become an emerging financial resource that
cannot be ignored. In the past, governments all over the world had promulgated legislation
and regulations for supervising blockchain digital assets, and now institutions in various
fields are conducting more research on blockchain technologies. While blockchain digital
assets were initially worthless, they are now recognized as being legitimate assets or

investments by millions of people.

With the evolution of blockchain technologies and the maturity of technical solutions, Bitcoin
and other digital currencies are all the rage in the global market. Meanwhile, the overall scale

of digital assets continues to increase, crossing the threshold of | trillion U.S. dollars.

—MarketCap @ 24h Vol

Currently, with dramatic growth of the secondary market for digital assets, there are over 300
digital asset trading platforms and more than 10 million active investing groups on a global
scale. According to Coinmarketcap, since December 2017, the daily trading volume of the
global digital asset market has exceeded 35 billion U.S. dollars, with the overall market
capitalization surpassing 500 billion U.S. dollars.

As a kind of emerging financial asset, due to its short development history and limited market
size, blockchain digital assets have not yet become the investment targets of mainstream
financial institutions. Thus, there has not been a professional financial asset trading platform

to provide trading services for digital asset users.
BITMART

However, even though some trading platforms had already been engaged in traditional
financial transactions, the technical architecture of their trading systems was not yet strong
enough to meet the requirements for professional financial systems—namely supporting
efficient concurrent transactions. These systems have been prone to failures during

transaction peaks, causing real financial losses for customers.

In addition, many trading platforms seem to process business flows imperfectly, lacking
certain functions and not fully meeting the needs of investors. Meanwhile, due to the isolation
of users on each platform and the lack of connections among platforms, the market depth of
individual platforms is not considerable enough to provide investors with a friendly

experience when they are conducting transactions.

Most importantly, no third party that endeavours to gain the public trust undertakes the
custody of blockchain digital assets. Indeed, all client assets are kept by the platforms, which
imposes high requirements on system security. Because of their special nature, blockchain
digital assets are likely to be attacked by malicious people in the network. Once a security
link is breached, it is highly probable that significant losses will be incurred by the platforms.

So far, several exchanges have been stolen, resulting in the loss of many users' assets.
1.2 Mission and Vision

The recent increase in the value of Bitcoin is starting to draw the attention of serious
investors worldwide. Right now on the market, there are other types of digital assets besides
Bitcoin, such as Litecoin and Ethereum, gaining popularity among investors. Meanwhile, we
also see a growing number of start-ups getting involved in the boom of the blockchain. They
are issuing new digital assets to raise funds for project development and have achieved great
success. We believe that blockchain digital assets will embrace a new future as more market
resources are allocated towards it. Our mission is to draw from our strengths to create a
globally integrated trading platform that provides safe, reliable and professional services to
investors and entrepreneurs worldwide, to promote the development of the blockchain

industry.

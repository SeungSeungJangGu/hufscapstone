Background

1.1 Introduction to HTML5

In recent years, after many hardware upgrades and rapid development of Internet

technology, some bottlenecks (such as performance, traffic and compatibility) that

previously limited the operation of HTML5 games have now been eliminated. Due to

the cross-platform nature of HTML5, this technology is widely used in games,

marketing, video, media, etc. Using the power of mobile social networking, HTML5

content has been widely disseminated in mobile apps and created entirely new

business models.

Mobile Games Web Apps
HTML
4 Interactive Ads S| 4 Rich Media Content
4 New Generation Videos : te

From their perspective, and due to the rapid pace of their lives and work, users
would like to make use of "fragmented time" at each leisure opportunity and
enjoy relaxation and entertainment. In terms of app operators, a new model is

expected to enhance user stickiness, gaining more traffic.

Click-and-play, viral transmission, user stickiness, these characteristics of an
HTML5 game make it a perfect fit for the current market demands.

Currently, users of HTML5 games already account for 47% of all mobile game
users. In terms of the business model, in-game payment, instead of advertising,
has become the main source of revenue accounting for 68%. Combined, HTML5
games already have an independent commercial profitability. In 2017, the market
size of HTML5 games in China exceeded 10 billion Yuan and showed a growing
trend. After more than four years of evolution and development, HTML5 games
have witnessed huge improvements related to business models, user numbers,
and market size.

The domestic revenue of high-quality HTML5 games, has reached 200 million
Yuan.

HTMLS5 technology has been globally recognised as a cross-platform and cross-
terminal solution. It covers the Internet, mobile game, video, advertising and
other industries, with a global market opportunity of 100 billion dollars.

Trend

Due to the advantages of HTML5 technology, an increasing number of well-
known enterprises have adopted this technology:

e Google launched PWA, advocating Android Instant Apps based on HTML5
technology.

e Baidu promoted "light-weight apps" based on HTML5 technology.

e Facebook released Instant Games based on HTML5 technology in Messenger
with more than 1 billion daily active users and opened its advertising and
payment service for Instant Games at the end of 2017.

e In January 2018, Tencent WeChat released a series of mini-games, some of
those games gaining over 100 million daily active users.

Overall, HTML5 has become one of the global Internet technology trends.

Pain Points

Despite the rapid development of HTML5 industry, there still remain many pain
points:

¢ Lack of a global, unified and secure payment platform;
¢ Lack of solutions to securely store virtual assets of users;

« Lack of mechanisms to ensure “fairness” in games;
¢ Lack of solutions to rapidly respond to distributed back-end communications;

¢ Lack of mechanisms to effectively protect the intellectual property of HTML5
products;

¢ Need for effective mechanisms to motivate good teams to develop high-quality
games and apps;

¢ Need for diversified approaches to monetise internet traffic.

1.2 Blockchain Industry Background

In recent years, blockchain technology has gradually been understood and applied to
related projects; advantages and disadvantages of the blockchain itself have become
increasingly obvious.

Advantages:

Distributed ledger mechanism: safe, transparent and tamper-resistant;

e Turing-complete smart contracts: fair-and-square;

Decentralised data storage combined with smart contracts: responsive and
reliable;

e Token system, unified payment and settlement.

Disadvantages:

Poor development, testing, and upgrade process;

Poor development tools and a small development community;
e User inconveniences, costs of learning are high;

e Security issues of accounts and wallets.

The Egretia team has joined hands with Egret Technology to create Egretia
Blockchain Lab. By combining blockchain technology with proven HTML5 workflows,
developers will be able to rapidly develop blockchain applications and truly apply
blockchain to the vertical industries.

Our Mission

2.1 World's First HTML5 Engine and Platform
2.2 Building a Decentralized HTML5 User Ecosystem
2.3 Creating an Ecosystem With True Token Circulation
Our Vision

“Bring 200,000 Developers and 1 Billion HTML5 Devices to The Blockchain World.”

2.1 World's First HTML5 Blockchain Engine and Platform

In partnership with Egret Technology, the global leader in the HTML5 industry, the
Egretia team is committed to building the world's first HTML5 blockchain engine and
platform, combining blockchain technology with proven tools, communities and
content of partners, aiming to bring 200,000 developers and 1 billion mobile devices
into the blockchain world.

User Ecosystem:

e The content powered by Egret Engine has reached hundreds of millions of users.
For every user, a unique cryptographic passport with digital encryption will be
created.

Users will be provided with a low-threshold, high-security digital wallet, serving as
a safe payment platform for all HTML5 blockchain applications.

e A digital virtual currency token that potentially circulates in HTML5 projects all
over the world will be created: (Egreten).

e An effective, sustainable ecosystem will be built for users.
Technical Aspects:

e Modularising blockchain functions, integrating them into the Egret Engine and its
front-end development tools, will contribute to directly reach more than 200,000
developers. Integrating Egreten into hundreds of thousands of games and
applications, will help to directly reach more than 1 billion users worldwide.

e Integrating blockchain technology into the backend service logic, using node
servers around the world will provide HTML5 products with fast communication
solutions and trusted smart contract server logic.
e A complete development suite, documentation and development community will

be built, to provide a most complete and convenient developer ecosystem.
Operational Aspects :

e Through the existing Egret game platform with 40 million monthly active
users, the Egretia Network already has a professional global team of game and
app distributors. They are operating the content and there are plays to
integrate the Egreten token payment system, thus promoting actual utility and
circulation of Egreten.

e Together with strategic partners such as Facebook and Google, the Egretia
Network has a well-established advertising platform to promote Egreten-based
games and products.

2.2 Building a Decentralised HTMLS5 User Ecosystem

Powered by the Egret Engine, HTML5 content has over 75% marketing
penetration in the HTML5 industry, covering more than 1 billion mobile devices

and users.

The blockchain of the Egretia Network will be combined with Egret HTML5
workflows. Using a token mechanism, every player will have a unique ID in
games powered by the Egret Engine. This will build a solid foundation for a
stable user ecosystem.

e Every user worldwide has a unique token passport in any game or application
which is developed based on the blockchain of the Egretia Network.

e The anonymity and encryption mechanism of the token passport effectively
ensures the privacy of users.

e Using unique, anonymous, secure tags, the identity of a user is not limited to
one application or one game. By using a unique, virtual identity, every user
can enjoy a life in the virtual world based on the Egretia Network.
e Due to the transparency and irreversibility of blockchain, as well as the unique
passport of each user, available throughout the content system built by the
Egretia Network, users can be accurately identified and rated for their
trustworthiness. Users can also safely communicate with other users around
the world using the Egretia Network, making friends, exchanging virtual
assets, etc.

2.3 Creating an Ecosystem With True Token Circulation

Based on the user ecosystem of the Egretia Network, there is the aim of forging a
new virtual currency token that can be used in all content powered by the Egret

Engine: Egreten.

e The ecosystem will provide well-established tools + SDKs for the blockchain

community and developers to design and build applications and products.

e Users can use Egreten as the currency to buy in-game items, pay for content,

etc.

e Users can use Egreten to take part in lotteries, discounts, and other promotions

on the Egretia Network across the world.

e Through the Egretia Network, users can participate in crowdfunding of games
which they support through the usage of Egreten, and potentially receive

Egreten incentives.

e Developers and content publishers can use Egreten to advertise their products

and services on the advertising platform of the Egretia Network.
e Distributors of content and users from the media industry can obtain Egreten

through content distribution, advertising, etc.

e An Egreten digital wallet is created based on the unique token passports of
users, in order to ensure safe storage of the virtual assets, goods,

crowdfunding rewards, platform incentives, etc of each user.

Throughout the ecosystem, it is envisaged that more than 200,000 developers
worldwide would be able to use the Egretia Blockchain SDK to rapidly develop
HTMLS blockchain games and applications. This will increase the reach of Egreten to
over a billion users, the token will be circulating in all areas of HTML5 content,
virtual goods platforms, advertising platforms, and communities.

Distributed Communications and Storage Platform : The platform will
leverage the node model of blockchain, providing decentralised data communications
and storage solutions.

Game Distribution Platform : This platform is the official DApp of the Egretia
Network: Players can obtain Egreten through the app, play HTML5 games on this
platform, make payments via Egreten. Through the Proof-of-Game (POG)
mechanism, players can obtain Egreten incentives through playing or sharing games
with friends. Users of the Egretia Network and/or holders of Egreten which did not
actively participate will not receive any Egreten incentives.

Virtual Goods Trading Platform : Using Egreten, all players in the games of the
Egretia Network can trade their virtual goods on this platform.

Egretia Ad Platforms : A precision advertising system, based on blockchain KYC
principles, smart contracts, and platform digital tokens.

Egretia Incubator : The incubator on the Egretia Network supports game
development teams and _ individuals, creating a bridge between players and
developers.

3.2 Features of the Egretia Network

Self-developed Public Chain

The Egretia Network will include a self-developed, efficient public chain based on the
DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) consensus mechanism, aimed at optimising HTML5
game performance. Through the blockchain interface layer, in combination with the
Egret engine tools, developers can quickly create blockchain-based DApps.

Consensus Mechanisms

22
The public chain of the Egretia Network will be using a DPoS (Delegated Proof of
Stake) as consensus mechanism.

The DPoS mechanism is similar to a board vote, where holders of coins cast a
certain number of nodes, using the mechanism for verification and bookkeeping.
DPoS can significantly reduce the number of participating nodes for verification
and bookkeeping, it is designed to be able to achieve consensus verification in a
second. For the avoidance of doubt, token holders which have delegated block
verification and bookkeeping to the nodes would not receive incentives based on
their token holdings only and without further contributing resources to the
network; only participating nodes which have contributed computing resources for
block verification and bookkeeping would be entitled to receive token incentives.

The stability of DPoS mechanism has been verified in BTS, EOS and other projects.

High-performance

The public chain of the Egretia Network is a public chain with high concurrent
processing power, where performance is optimised for the needs of the game
industry. It is designed to have a fast TPS (Transaction Per Second) rate.
Nonetheless, in blockchain technology, an "impossible triangle" exists, meaning that
scalability, decentralisation, and security cannot be achieved at the same time.

Using a DPoS mechanism to greatly increase scalability, more than 2,000
transactions per second could be supported in the initial test chain. In the future, the

TPS will be increased according to business needs.

Real-time Parameter Adjustment

The Egretia Network can modify system parameters without bifurcation: Instead, the
Egretia Network will be able to change blocktime, blocksize, transaction fee etc. via

voting.

The Egretia Network can modify the system parameters without bifurcation: Instead,
the Egretia Network will be able to realise a dynamic adjustment of parameters such
as blocksize, output speed, and handling fee through voting method based on
consensus.

23
For example: A current blocktime of 3 seconds, can be dynamically adjusted to 1
second; or a current blocksize of 2M, can be dynamically adjusted to create larger
blocks, such as 8M.

For the avoidance of doubt, ultimately community members are not connected with
the Foundation (or its affiliates) in any manner, and the assets and funds of the
Foundation (or its affiliates) remain under the control of the relevant Board of
Directors who shall exercise independent judgement and apply them to achieve the
Foundation's objects. The right to vote does not entitle Egreten holders to vote on
the operation and management of the Foundation (or its affiliates) or their assets,
and does not constitute any equity interest in the Foundation (or its affiliates).

Convenient and Efficient Development Suite

The proven tools of Egret lays a solid foundation for the blockchain project of the
Egretia Network, making blockchain application development simple, convenient and
efficient.

Support Mainstream Languages and Frameworks

The development suite integrates the support for JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS,
Node.js, through the extensions, it can easily support more languages and
frameworks, such as C #, Go, C++, AngularJS, React and so on.

Smart Coding Assistance

Smart Coding Assistance will provide major languages with intelligent code
completion, real-time error feedback, reference search, jump to definitions, and
other functions, to help developers more quickly program.

Built-in Complete Game Development Workflow

Integration of visual game development environment; covering the entire
development process (developing, debugging, publishing, packaging); in addition,
resource management, particle editing, animation editing, cloud publishing and other

24
extensions are available, thus making the experience of developing games friendlier

and smoother.

The interfaces of Egret Wing IDE and DragonBones animation tool

Egretia SDK

The Egretia blockchain SDK will be provided with engine and tools, which will allow
all HTML5 games to easily access the blockchain. Developers can quickly create
HTML5 games and applications that provide blockchain capabilities such as digital

wallet, smart contracts, etc.

e Accessing the blockchain through a few lines of code,

Storing the key information of users on the blockchain with KYC (Know Your
Customer) certification,

e Providing data storage, data communication and authentication services,
e Easy access to digital wallet and create smart contract,

e Using digital token SDK for virtual goods trading in games.

Digital Virtual Currency Token: Egreten

The global gaming market size in 2017 is over 100 billion dollars, but there isn't a
way to connect different games, each game is connected to its own independent

economy.

25
The native digital cryptographically-secured utility token of the Egretia Network
(Egreten) is a major component of the ecosystem on the Egretia Network, and is
designed to be used solely as the primary token on the network. Egreten will initially
be issued by the Distributor as ERC-20 standard compliant digital tokens on the
Ethereum blockchain, and these will be migrated to tokens on the Egretia blockchain
when the same is eventually launched.

Egreten is a non-refundable functional utility token which will be used as the unit of
exchange between participants on the Egretia Network. The goal of introducing
Egreten is to provide a convenient and secure mode of payment and settlement
between participants who interact within the ecosystem on the Egretia Network.
Developers can easily combine Egreten with their own games, and players can safely
and efficiently conduct virtual goods trading.

Egreten does not in any way represent any shareholding, participation, right, title, or
interest in the Foundation, its affiliates, or any other company, enterprise or
undertaking, nor will Egreten entitle token holders to any promise of fees, dividends,
revenue, profits or investment returns, and are not intended to constitute securities
in Singapore or any relevant jurisdiction. Egreten may only be utilised on the Egretia
Network, and ownership of Egreten carries no rights, express or implied, other than
the right to use Egreten as a means to enable usage of and interaction with the
Egretia Network.

Wallet

Both game developers and gamers will be able to manage Egreten through their
wallets. Users will be provided with a low-threshold, high-security digital wallet,
making the Egretia Network a safe payment platform for all HTML5 blockchain
applications. Currently, PC, mobile, and browser versions of the wallet are being
developed.

Scalability, Supporting Mainstream Public Chains

From a long-term view, the blockchain framework will not only support the native
chain of the Egretia Network, but will also be extended to support Ethereum, EOS
and other public chains, so that all HTML5 developers can efficiently create
blockchain-based games and applications.

The Egret Engine will provide the Egretia BaaS SDK, which will allow easy access to
blockchain for all Egret games. Through the Egretia BaaS SDK, developers can
create blockchain games or migrate existing Egret games to blockchain games in an
easy way.

HTMLS Blockchain Engine Architecture

As shown above in the diagram, the bottom part represents the Egret Engine. Using
the Egret IDE tool “Wing”, developers can quickly develop HTML5 games. As long as
developers add the Egretia BaaS SDK while creating a new project, blockchain-
related APIs will be easily accessible.

The Egretia BaaS SDK and the included APIs are as follows:

Egretia Game API

With blockchain popularity rapidly increasing, many developers are eager to
“blockchain-ise” their games. However, as a matter of fact, blockchain technology is
fairly complicated. At the same time, not all developers have sufficient time to fully
leverage the underlying technology. The Egretia Game API is a solution through
which developers can obtain easy access to blockchain.

Through the Egretia Game API, HTML5 games can be “blockchain-ised” with just a
few lines of code. As you can see from the image above, by adding the Egretia BaaS
SDK into games, and then calling the API interface in accordance with official

28
documentation tutorials, developers will be able to combine HTML5 games with
blockchain technology.

KYC Certification

With the help of KYC (Know Your Customer) information, user information is
encrypted and stored on the blockchain. Due to the anonymity and traceability of
blockchain, it is safe and reliable to store user information on the Egretia Network.
Using the KYC blockchain ID, users will only have to sign up once for all games built
by HTMLS5 Blockchain Engine.

Egretia Data API

The game industry has been criticised because of opaque data, some developers
control the falling probability of virtual goods in order to increase their revenue.
Although the entire industry has put a lot of effort into solving the problem, for
example, a group of developers has made public the falling probability of virtual
goods, game players still feel sceptical about game developers.

Through the Egretia Data API, developers can store the core data logic of games
and applications in the Egretia Network, thus realising data storage account
disclosure and process verification: this is making the data open, fair, and
transparent.

For example, game developers write the core data logic, game _ transaction
information, and game equipment values onto the blockchain, so that players can
view the game numerical information at any time. This helps solving the mutual trust
problem between game developers and players.

Egreten API

As the API for the virtual currency ecosystem on the Egretia Network, virtual in-
game items can be placed on the trading platform.

Egretia Runtime

29
Egret Runtime is an accelerator component developed by Egret team to enhance the
HTML5 game performance and can be embedded as a seamless extension into a
browser or other applications on mobile devices. By using Egret Runtime, game
developers can ignore the differences between diverse operating systems, browsers,
and terminals so that HTML5 games can run more efficiently with amazing
performance. In addition, runtime also has access to mobile device hardware,
improving the gaming experience. By the end of 2017, Egret Runtime has been
installed 1 billion times.

Egretia Runtime Architecture

The Egretia Runtime is a completely upgraded version of the Egret Runtime. Not
only does it fully support the functions of the original runtime, it also integrates the
Egretia blockchain modules to make for more secure core functions at the lower
layer of the application. The Egretia BaaS Module, which allows developers to easily
call the blockchain interface of the Egretia Network, also fully supports the DPoS
mechanism, realising ledger and data exchange on the basis layer of the Runtime.

Egretia Game Global Distribution Platform

The Open Platform of the strategic partner of the Egretia team, Egret Technology, is
the largest HTML5 gaming platform in the world. It has more than 2,000 distribution

30
channels and more than 65,000 HTML5 games, with 40 million monthly active users.
Leveraging the new business mode revolution brought by blockchain technology, the
Egret Open Platform will be fully upgraded to a decentralised HTML5 gaming
distribution platform, supporting HTML5 developers and reaching HTML5 players

worldwide.

Egretia Game Platform Architecture

Egretia Game Platform

As shown above, with the Egret Engine and the Egretia BaaS SDK, game developers
have easy access to blockchain. Players can obtain a unique ID through KYC, and
use it when playing all the games on the platform of the Egretia Network.

Since the Egretia Network adopts DPoS and PoG to implement distributed ledger and
data exchange mechanisms, the longer the players will stay in games, the greater
the PoG values will be. Depending on the duration of the game and the level of
experience, players can obtain various amounts of Egreten, which will enable them
to buy virtual goods in the game.

Game developers may obtain Egreten by operating games.

Egretia Game Distribution Mechanism

31
The game platform on the Egretia Network is a decentralised HTML5 game
distribution platform. Developers can independently launch HTML5 games and offer
tasks encouraging players to spread games. After completing the promotion tasks,
players will obtain some Egreten as an incentive. This way, developers will be able to
attract many players, and those players are able to obtain virtual currency, thus
forming a healthy ecosystem.

The Virtual Goods Trading Platform

Players have always faced the problem how to ensure the value of virtual goods and
the security of personal information in virtual goods transactions. The Egretia virtual
goods trading platform can help to solve this problem.

Trading Platform Architecture

As pictured above, players can sell virtual goods of a certain game on the trading
platform. After selecting the game, a game server, the virtual goods category, and
specific items, virtual goods can be sold in exchange for Egreten.

On the other hand, players can spend Egreten buying virtual goods on the trading
platform.

HTML5 games connect the in-game virtual goods to the trading platform via the
Egretia BaaS SDK. Traditional virtual goods and account trading model are lacking

32
mutual trust at its foundation. Based on the smart contract mechanism of
blockchain, both buyers and sellers can conduct transactions without concerns and
will not need any guarantee from a third party.

Based on the traceability feature of blockchain, traders can view historical
transaction records of virtual goods at any time. Besides, the anonymity of
blockchain can well protect the privacy of buyers and sellers.

Decentralised Advertising Platform

An advertising platform based on the Egretia Network will be created. Based on KYC
principles, the Egretia Network is capable of capturing user profiles accurately so
that ads that users are interested in can be delivered. On the other hand, the token-
based advertising platform will be helpful to Egreten circulation.

As shown above, decentralised blockchain-based advertising is a good solution for
the shortcomings of traditional advertising.

e Advertisers can serve ads using the Egreten virtual currency on the Egretia
Network.

e Developers integrate ads with content through the tools and SDK on the Egretia
Network, which will allow them to obtain Egreten.

33
e Developers can also spend Egreten paid by users upon delivering ads in order to
attract more users.

e Based on KYC principles, the advertising platform can protect the privacy of users
while getting user data, effectively pushing content that users are really interested
in, greatly reducing the costs for advertisement.

e Players can obtain Egreten by forwarding ads.

As the first HTML5 blockchain platform, the Egreten team is also actively
communicating with overseas partners such as Facebook, in order to jointly embrace
the future of blockchain together.

Distributed Communication & Storage Cloud Platform

comprehensive distributed communications & storage services.

The more developers and content, the more widely distributed server nodes. The
faster storage of data and files being read, the quicker the client and server-side

communications.

By calling the SDK provided, developers can simply access communication services

on the Egretia Network, realising online multiplayer, data & file storage, back-end

34
game logic customisation. Usability, low latency, high availability, expansibility,

customisability, are its characteristics.

In addition to helping developers create a game from its concept, it is easy to
migrate a single-player game into a cross-regional, cross-server, low-latency online
game based on the technology of the Egretia Network, thus greatly reducing the

cost of game development.

Multi-nodes, low latency

Decentralised worldwide server nodes and the original "server frame
synchronisation" technology, will make for a quicker and more stable transmission of
game data. In the meantime, to meet the needs of large multi-player online games,
full advantage will be taken of the rich experience the Egretia team has with building
platforms and adopting a "deep coupling" approach. Information that does not affect
fairness will be managed in a traditional manner and core data will be processed
through smart blockchain-based contracts. Seamless coordination ensures fairness
and a smooth gaming experience.

Quick Match

Based on distributed back-end communications, a flexible matching mechanism will
be meeting the majority of the matching requirements under different customisable
rules. This will help in enriching the gameplay, helping more players build
connections, and truly achieving the state of "global players using the same server".

Quick Access

Modularising the game lobby, room and interactive processes, the needs of
developers will be taken into consideration, combining front-end engine and tools for
developers to quickly access and develop games.

The Server-Side Logic of "Smart Contract" Management

35
Aside from basic networking capabilities, game developers will also be provided with
a server-side framework based on smart contracts, the Egretia Backend Logic
Framework. Developers will be able to extend server networking capabilities to
implement the customised server-side game logic. Because the server-side logic is
based on the blockchain of the Egretia Network and managed through smart
contracts, the game logic is open and fair, which can effectively prevent plug-ins.

RRR

The decentralised game distribution platform is currently under development, all the
games are developed based on the blockchain of the Egretia Network, accessing the
KYC authentication system, the digital tokens, the data storage module and other
functions of the Egretia Network.

On this game platform, players can not only play all HTML5 games, but also obtain
digital virtual currency tokens through playing games, while at the same time
gaining token incentives through completing the tasks in games. The assets of all
players are securely stored in an Egretia wallet.

Because each user on the game platform has a unique passport, accurate user
profiles can be obtained based on historical data, thus matching players according to

36
their interests. Thus the platform of the Egretia Network is not only a game
platform, but also a social platform.

Professional Operation Team and Incubator

The professional gaming operations team of the Egretia Network, with its
outstanding global promotion capabilities in mobile games and applications, will
focus on global promotion of premium games and applications based on the
blockchain of the Egretia Network. Cooperative agreements have been made with a
number of content providers worldwide to develop quality games and apps based on
the Egretia Network. At the same time, the native incubator will support outstanding
content or technical teams, jointly growing with them together.

Risks

You acknowledge and agree that there are numerous risks associated with
purchasing Egreten, holding Egreten, and using Egreten for participation in the
Egretia Network. In the worst scenario, this could lead to the loss of all or part of the
Egreten which had been purchased.

1. Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions

The regulatory status of Egreten and distributed ledger technology is unclear or
unsettled in many jurisdictions. The regulation of virtual currencies has become a
primary target of regulation in all major countries in the world. It is impossible to
predict how, when or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulations or
create new regulations with respect to such technology and its applications,
including Egreten and/or the Egretia Network. Regulatory actions could negatively
impact Egreten and/or the Egretia Network in various ways. The Foundation (or its
affiliates) may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions,
or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or
commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate
in such jurisdiction. After consulting with a wide range of legal advisors and
continuous analysis of the development and legal structure of virtual currencies, the
Foundation will apply a cautious approach towards the sale of Egreten. Therefore,
for the token sale, the Foundation may constantly adjust the sale strategy in order to
avoid relevant legal risks as much as possible. For the token sale the Foundation is
working with Tzedek Law LLC, a boutique corporate law firm in Singapore with a
good reputation in the blockchain space.

2. Inadequate disclosure of information

As at the date hereof, the Egretia Network is still under development and its design
concepts, consensus mechanisms, algorithms, codes, and other technical details and
parameters may be constantly and frequently updated and changed. Although this
white paper contains the most current information relating to the Egretia Network, it
is not absolutely complete and may still be adjusted and updated by the Egretia
team from time to time. The Egretia team has no ability and obligation to keep
holders of Egreten informed of every detail (including development progress and

46
expected milestones) regarding the project to develop the Egretia Network, hence
insufficient information disclosure is inevitable and reasonable.

3. Competitors

Various types of decentralised applications are emerging at a rapid rate, and the
industry is increasingly competitive. It is possible that alternative networks could be
established that utilise the same or similar code and protocol underlying Egreten
and/or the Egretia Network and attempt to re-create similar facilities. The Egretia
Network may be required to compete with these alternative networks, which could
negatively impact Egreten and/or the Egretia Network.

4. Loss of Talent

The development of the Egretia Network depends on the continued co-operation of
the existing technical team and expert consultants, who are highly knowledgeable
and experienced in their respective sectors. The loss of any member may adversely
affect the Egretia Network or its future development. Further, stability and cohesion
within the team is critical to the overall development of the Egretia Network. There
is the possibility that conflict within the team and/or departure of core personnel
may occur, resulting in negative influence on the project in the future.

5. Failure to develop

There is the risk that the development of the Egretia Network will not be executed or
implemented as planned, for a variety of reasons, including without limitation the
event of a decline in the prices of any digital asset, virtual currency or Egreten,
unforeseen technical difficulties, and shortage of development funds for activities.

6. Security weaknesses

Hackers or other malicious groups or organisations may attempt to interfere with
Egreten and/or the Egretia Network in a variety of ways, including, but not limited
to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil
attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, there is a risk that a third party or a
member of the Foundation or its affiliates may intentionally or unintentionally

47
introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure of Egreten and/or the Egretia
Network, which could negatively affect Egreten and/or the Egretia Network.

Further, the future of cryptography and security innovations are highly unpredictable
and advances in cryptography, or technical advances (including without limitation
development of quantum computing), could present unknown risks to Egreten and/
or the Egretia Network by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus

mechanism that underpins that blockchain protocol.
7. Other risks

In addition, the potential risks briefly mentioned above are not exhaustive and there
are other risks (as more particularly set out in the Terms and Conditions) associated
with your purchase, holding and use of Egreten, including those that the Foundation
cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialise as unanticipated variations or
combinations of the aforementioned risks. You should conduct full due diligence on
the Foundation, its affiliates and the Egretia team, as well as understand the overall

framework, mission and vision for the Egretia Network prior to purchasing Egreten.

Executive Summary

Axion offers a first of its kind blockchain powered venture fund alongside high interest time-locked
savings deposits (stakes) that earn investors high interest of ~8% plus additional dividends. Axion also
acts as a scalable, spendable global currency with its native token AXN. Pay for anything in everyday
life using AXN and BTC dividends with our strategic partnership with Connect Financial, who offer a true
world class VISA-sponsored crypto credit card that works directly with our native digital token AXN,

Bitcoin, and more.

Axion allows anyone to earn on their investment via venture capital auctions and time-locked deposits
on the blockchain with the AXN token. Share rates in the Axion ecosystem are the most valuable asset
as they determine the payouts drawn from reward pools / investment pools / dividend pools. Shares
as they are in the Axion ecosystem are earned by staking AXN, with the share rate determined by the
accumulation of users’ share(s) divided by the total shares in the ecosystem multiplied by the payout
for each day’s reward cycle. Network participants earn higher share rate(s) by staking AXN for larger

and longer periods of time (much like CDs) in order to accumulate more dividends/rewards.

Staking AXN tokens earns investors liquid dividends while simultaneously earning interest on their
principal AXN that is staked on our platform. Our innovative dividend-producing mechanisms provide
investors and AXN shareholders rewards in Bitcoin and other top

cryptocurrencies, which are immediately liquid while their AXN accrues interest upon its principal via

our smart contracts for the users’ desired period of time, based on their stake length.

Trust and transparency in the Axion network is based on mathematical principles, blockchain
technology, and smart contracts on the Ethereum network. Additionally, our highly experienced team
and cooperative community members offer an unparalleled level of support to ensure a simplified,

safe, and secure process in understanding and participating in our decentralized platform.

04. Why Axion Exists

In the last few decades, adoption and growth of financial technology (FinTech) products and services have increased in a
rather substantial and secular fashion - into the multiple trillions of dollars of market capitalization. FinTech is both the
innovative technology, and the industry in which new financial service-based applications, business models, processes
and operations, and products are created and utilized by corporations, entrepreneurs, and consumers. The digitization of
financial instruments has proven to be ever more useful and prominent in more recent times, due to the global pandemic
of ~2020-2021. Two examples of accelerated growth in FinTech services throughout the pandemic include the digitization
of payments and otherwise conventional financial services being delivered digitally. From being unable to visit local bank
branches in order to make deposits to obligatory work-from-home requirements, more often we see consumers and
clients utilize services that are entirely digital.

The emergence of blockchain technology has demonstrated disruption in centralized economies by
introducing decentralized economies of scale, transparency, and of user control. The introduction
and rise of Bitcoin illustrated the strength of distributed ledger technology (DLT) by showcasing
and retaining immutable data and an unprecedented level of security on the blockchain - thus
reducing fraud and maintaining global accessibility in a digital payments system; cryptocurrency.

Beyond Bitcoin there exist other blockchains and cryptocurrencies, most notably Ethereum -
another decentralized, global ecosystem that not only introduces digital money and worldwide

ayments, but applications as well.

Building upon the foundational layers of financial services, systems, and blockchain technology
as brought forth one of the most substantial and innovative growth economies on the
Ethereum network - decentralized finance (DeFi). These particular applications utilize
cryptocurrencies to offer a new paradigm in typical banking systems and products like lending,

rivate payments, and earning interest.

DeFi had amassed over USD $39.11B on March ‘st, 2021 from just roughly USD $1.01B
exactly one year prior, exhibiting an exponential 39x growth in Total Value Locked (TVL).

Enter Axion. Axion is a decentralized finance application and network that is designed to increase the purchasing power
of its ecosystem participants through providing a mathematically viable interest accrual model (through inflation) in its

platform, executed via blockchain smart contracts.

While Axion provides ecosystem participants (stakers) with interest paid in its native digital token AXN at the end of
mutually agreed upon staking period(s), it also utilizes Bitcoin’s liquidity on the Ethereum network by awarding tokenized
Bitcoin (wBTC) to stakers in the form of liquid dividends. Axion’s “staker” class can earn and spend tokenized Bitcoin
globally, efficiently, and with trust and integrity on the blockchain, with the amount of both dividends and interest earned

based on the aforementioned share rate that individual users have accrued by staking.

Axion aims to solve common traditional finance concerns and issues, which range from antiquated banking practices,
centralized governance and authority, and immensely low interest rates and returns on investment(s).

What are Smart Contracts?

Axion is a cryptocurrency that runs on the Ethereum network, which is a decentralized blockchain network
that not only manages transactions from one currency to another, or one wallet to another, but also allows
for unique code to be run on its network in a secure, verifiable manner. Smart Contracts can be summarized
as computer code that self-executes or automatically executes specific function(s) or agreement to run on
the decentralized network - the blockchain.

The functions of the Axion smart contract(s) include:
+ Daily auctions.
+ Token buybacks.
+ Staking tokens from auctions.
+ Early exit and withdrawal fees.
: Fixed inflation rate.
+ Network staking.
- Share distribution.
+ Bonus multipliers.
+ Implementation of longer stakes paying better.
* Calculation of payout pools.
- Automation of payouts.
-“BigPayDays” accruing yearly for stakers.
+ Referral programs
Payouts of wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) dividends.

Within all of these functions exists complex code that has taken expert development over several months.
The majority of the code is also public for transparency on GitHub. There has also been an independent
economics audit to ensure the platform has infinite operability for decades to come. These are the benefits
of Axion being a cryptocurrency on the world’s most popular and trusted blockchain- Ethereum.

06. Axion’s Business Model

Axion’s business model can be explained in just a few steps. There is the act of acquiring Axion (AXN), staking it,
and then receiving dividends based on how a user chose to stake.

In the most simple terms,

staking is locking up cryptocurrencies to earn rewards.

”

Acquire Axion
through auctions
or Uniswap

Earn dividends
spend Bitcoin

Stake Axion
on the Axion
platform

Staking within the Axion ecosystem is different from other definitions of staking within a blockchain-based
ecosystem. Traditionally, staking refers to the consensus algorithm that supports a blockchain network with regards
to operability and security- referred to as Proof of Stake (PoS). Axion’s network is already secured by the underlying
blockchain, which at the moment is Ethereum- the most utilized blockchain in decentralized finance.

Step 1: Acquiring Axion through auctions or Uniswap.

A user will perform one of two actions- purchase Axion by trading it from Ethereum (ETH) on Uniswap (a popular
decentralized automated market maker) or by participating in the Auctions. There are two separate auctions, Regular
Auctions and Venture Capital Auctions.

Regular Auctions

The regular auction “raffles” accumulated Axion tokens between users, in proportion to the participants’ bid in
Ethereum (ETH). Any leftover AXN from the auction rolls over into the next weekly auction. When a user places a bid
in ETH, 80% of the received ETH is used to instantly buy back AXN on Uniswap and the received AXN is distributed as
dividends to the staker class. 19% of the ETH is Axion Foundation profit whereas 1% goes to The Eden Reforestation
Project where every $0.10 donated plants one tree. The Axion founder owns no AXN tokens and is paid directly
through the Axion Foundation.
Axion Whitepaper

All Axion received from this auction including referral bonuses must be staked for a minimum of 60 days upon .
withdrawal. The stake length may be increased to 5555 days. By increasing the stake length, the more shares the
user receives in return which results in more dividends received from the auction buybacks.

Venture Capital Auctions
There are two Venture Capital Auctions per week, on Tuesday and Friday. Each of these particular auctions have a
maximum cap of 1B (billion) AXN, for a total of 2B per week. Venture Capital Auctions bring in a new dividend asset
class in the form of wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) which simply utilizes Bitcoin’s liquidity on the Ethereum network. The
Venture Capital Auction investor also receives an immediate 10% bonus in the form of liquid wBTC direct to their

wallet, as soon as their bid transaction is confirmed.

The auto-stake period for VCA’s are a minimum of 120 days- longer than the normal auctions in order to offset the
additional reward paid in wBTC. VC auction investors may choose to stake for anything between 120 days up to a
maximum of 5555 days by adjusting a sliding scale with the date attached. Longer auto-stake periods for purchased
AXN benefit greatly due to the BigPayDays and LongerPaysBetter bonuses while also securing a better share rate.

The rewards for VCA’s are wBTC, where 85% of all ETH raised is used to purchase wBTC and distribute it across
the staker class- these dividends are liquid and withdrawable at any time. A further 10% is a wBTC bonus to the
bidder, and 5% is Axion Foundation profit. In the near future, additional alternative coin (altcoin) dividends will be
introduced.

Users can find the auction portal and more information here.

Step 2: Staking Axion on the Axion platform.

The Axion staking platform is where users lock up their Axion in exchange for shares to earn dividends over time. The
staking contract temporarily burns AXN in return for shares. Shares in the Axion ecosystem are the most valuable
asset as they determine the payouts drawn from reward pools / investment pools / dividend pools. A user‘s share
rate is determined by the accumulation of users’ share(s) divided by the total shares in the ecosystem multiplied by
the payout for each day’s reward cycle. Network participants earn higher share rate(s) by staking AXN for larger and
longer periods of time (much like CDs) in order to accumulate more dividends over time.

Users can find the staking portal and more information here.

Step 3: Earn dividends, spend Bitcoin

Axion shareholders that are staked in the ecosystem earn dividends in the form of tokenized Bitcoin (wBTC) which
they can withdraw and spend, while the principal AXN accrues interest that is able to be withdrawn at the end of the
stake period, alongside the principal amount of AXN. When a user ends their stake, their shares cease to exist and
their AXN is minted and sent to their respective wallet.

07. Ecosystem Features

SHARES & INTEREST

The principle behind the staking system is to lock the Axion amount for a period and convert it to
Shares (on the StartDay of the stake) that rewards longer staking according to the LongerPaysBetter
bonus mechanism. These Shares are used to calculate a daily interest (in Axion) over the stake
period. Each day a total interest to be shared among all stakeholders called TotPayoutAxn(Day) is
calculated and given in equation (1)

(1)

TotPayoutAxn( Day) =APD (TotLiquidAxn(Day — 1) + TotStakedAxn(Day — 1))
+ AuctionBuyBackAxn(Day — 1)

where the different parameters are

e APD is the daily interest APY/(100x365) = 8%/(100x365).

e —TotLiquidAxn(Day-1) is the total liquid Axion amount on the previous day.

e = TotStakedAxn(Day-1) is the total staked Axion amount on the previous day.

e AuctionBuyBackAxn(Day-1) is the payout from Regular Auction events from the previous
day.

Each stakeholder’s daily interest PayoutAxn(Day) is calculated proportional to the Stakeholder-Share
-Percentage (SSP ) {or PerCentage-of-Pool, PoP as in axioncalc.com}

(2)

PayoutAxn( Day) = S00 SSP(Day) TotalPayoutAxn( Day)

The SSP at the current Day is

(3)
100 Shares(StartDay)

SSP(Day) = TotShares( Day)

where Shares(StartDay) is calculated at the start of the stake and is constant over the whole stake
and TotShares(Day) is the sum of all stakeholders shares at the current Day. TotShares(Day) will
change from day-day depending on the added and subtracted shares from new stakes and unstakes.

At the end of the stake the stakeholder’s unstake amount UnstakeAxn(EndDay) is calculated as the
sum of all days of interest and the principal StakeAxn(StartDay)

(4)
EndDay

UnstakeAxn(EndDay) = StakeAxn(StartDay) + SX PayoutAxn( Day)
Day= StartDay + 1

In addition each stakeholder will receive liquid dividends in form of wBTC from the Venture Capital
Auctions proportional to the stakeholder’s SSP.
Axion Whitepaper >>>>

LONGER PAYS BETTER

The idea behind Axion’s LongerPaysBetter (LBP) functionality is to reward users that stake for longer
periods of time, much like that of a standard certificate of deposit. The longer duration of the stake,
the more shares are earned as a bonus.

The total number of Shares earned at the StartDay of staking is given by the equation
(5)
Shares(StartDay) = BasicShares(StartDay) + LpbShares(StartDay)

where BasicShares is given by
(6)

StakedAxn

BasicShares(StartDay) = “GSR(StartDay)
‘artDay

and LpbShares is given by
(7)

1 StakedAxn (NumDaysStaked — 1)
1820 GSR(StartDay)

LpbShares(StartDay) =

where the “minus 1” accounts for the minimum stake period of 1 day.

The GSR(StartDay) is the so-called Global-Share-Rate (see next chapter for details) which is used to
control the inflation, such that the number of Shares for a new stake is reduced over time by
increasing the GSR factor a small amount every day. A new GSR update procedure was introduced
on February 15" 2021 with a start value of 1.09 and with the current rate of change an estimate
(equation 14) gives a GSR value of 1.55 and 2.22 for stakes starting one and two years later.

In order to illustrate the multiplication effect of LongerPaysBetter we assume a stake of 1 Axion.
Then we can define a BonusMultiplier by using equation (5) and insert equation (6) and (7) and get
the equation

(8)
BonusMultiplier(StartDay) = BasicMultiplier(StartDay) + LpbMultiplier(StartDay)
af where BasicMultiplier is given by

The number of Shares may thus alternatively be calculated using the BonusMultiplier (BM) equation

(11)
Shares(StartDay) = StakedAxn BonusMultiplier(StartDay)

The BonusMultiplier (BM) equation (8) is shown in Figure 1 below for all staking days from 1-5555
where BM example values are shown every other year using the 3 GSR values of 1.09, 1.55 and 2.22
for stakes starting at February 15" in 2021,2022 and 2023 respectively. The maximum BM value at
5555 days (~15.2 year) is 3.72,2.61,1.83 which is equivalent to a multiplier effect of 372%,261% and
183%.

Axion has created its own liquidity mining platform that allows participants to provide liquidity on Uniswap (Axion’s
preferred open marketplace to buy and sell AXN), to earn additional rewards in AXN. Users deposit Liquidity Provider
(LP) tokens on Uniswap and get rewarded in liquid AXN rewards that are calculated on a block-by-block basis. On
average, a new block is created every 13 seconds and therefore users can both see their rewards withdraw their
rewards, in real time.

This initiative incentivizes liquidity trading pool provision for the Axion ecosystem where rewards are accrued on top
of the standard fee generation from Uniswap.

In order to participate, users must deposit into a mine on our platform page found below, and then follow these
simple steps:

* Purchase or own AXN tokens.

* Fund the Uniswap liquidity pool with AXN and an ETH equivalent.

¢ Upon adding liquidity, Uniswap generates you LP tokens as a proof of deposit.

* Deposit these LP tokens in the portal to earn rewards in AXN while supporting the ecosystem.

Within this platform, there exists three non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that interact directly with this particular contract-
the OG 5555 2.5M V2, the OG 5555 100M V2, and the Liquidity Provision NFT. Each NFT provides a 10% bonus to the
liquidity allocation if held in a user wallet.

All of the statistics of the rewards/liquidity mining platform can be found here.
Axion Whitepaper >>>>

GLOBAL SHARE RATE

The Axion ecosystem has a built-in inflation over time since the total Axion volume
TotSupplyAxn(Day) = TotLiquidAxn(Day)+TotStakedAxn(Day) is increased for every unstake, auction
and BigPayDay event where additional Axions are minted. This means that the total interest
TotPayoutAxn(Day) increases over time which in turn increases the daily PayoutAxn(Day) per stake.
In order to control the inflation, the number of Shares for a new stake is reduced over time by
increasing the Global-Share-Rate (GSR) factor a small amount every day. This means that a new
stake converts to fewer Shares if a user starts a new stake tomorrow or later instead of today with
the same amount of Axion. This is also an efficient way to reward long staking over “gaming”
strategies with multiple “staking-unstaking-staking” over short periods of time (see Appendix A 1.3
for details).

Anew GSR update procedure was introduced on February 15. 2021 with a start value of 1.09 and
increased each day according to the following equation

(12)
GSR(Day) =GSR( Day — 1) (1 + ScalingFactor(Day) GrowthFactor (Day) )
where the different parameters are

e GSR(Day-1) is the GSR value on the previous day.

e GrowthFactor(Day) is the main parameter used to automatically control GSR increase

e ScalingFactor(Day) is an inflation rate change control parameter that may be used for
additional decrease or increase rate of the GSR update amount. Currently fixed at 1.0.

The GrowthFactor(Day) for the current Day is calculated as

(13)

AuctionBuyBackAxn(Day — 1)
TotLiquidAxn (Day — 1) + TotStakedAxn(Day — 1)

GrowthFactor(Day) = APD +

The current GrowthFactor(Day) measured over 15 days from February 15" is 0.0009733 where APD
is fixed at 0.0002198 and the average contribution from the auction buybacks are 0.0007541.

In order to illustrate the effect of the GrowthFactor(Day) on GSR update, the current GSR update
function may thus be written using DaysRelative to February 15. 2021 as

(14)

GSR, ,,(DaysRelative 20210215) = 1.09 1,0009733°*Relaive

‘example

This gives a small increase from day-day, but after 1 year and 2 years the GSR value is increased from é
1.09 to 1.55 and 2.22 respectively with a corresponding decrease in number of Shares for the same
amount of staked Axion.
2 2 = ° e

- x ey

e 0018 <<<< Axion Whitepaper

Note that the GSR-example equation above is assuming a constant GrowthFactor(Day), but it will
vary in the future due to the variations in the daily payout amounts from the auctions as shown in
the GrowthFactor(Day) equation above.

When a user stake for a longer period, in addition to increased number of Shares from the
LongerPaysBetter mechanism, the total interest is also earned over a longer period resulting in an
exponential effect on the interest versus NumDaysStaked.

In order to describe the relationship we assume that TotSupplyAxn and AuctionBuyBackAxn are
constant for each day and may thus simplify equation (4) to

(15)

UnstakeAxn( EndDay) = StakedAxn(StartDay)
4 Shares(StartDay) (NumDaysStaked — 1) (APD TotSupplyAxn + AuctionBuyBackAxn)
TotShares

Inserting equation 6, 7 in 15 and simplify we get

(16)

UnstakeAxn(EndDay) = StakedAxn(StartDay)

1 StakedAxn (APD TotSupplyAxn + AuctionBuyBackAxn) NumDaysStaked 2
1820 TotShares GSR( StartDay)
909 StakedAxn (APD TotSupplyAxn + AuctionBuyBackAxn) NumDaysStaked
910 TotShares GSR( StartDay)
1819 StakedAxn (APD TotSupplyAxn + AuctionBuyBackAxn)
1820 TotShares GSR( StartDay)

which shows a quadratic effect from the NumDaysStaked.

Equation 16 is used in 2 examples to illustrate the effect of the start day of staking with the following
assumptions:

e  TotShares(Day) is fixed at 392 Billion
e TotSupplyAxn(Day) = TotLiquidAxn(Day) + TotStakedAxn(Day) is fixed at 264 Billion

BIG PAY DAYS :

Big Pay Days (BPD) are a valuable reward mechanism that was built into the Axion ecosystem to incentivize longer
stakes. There are 50,000,000,000 AXN tokens allotted to the Big Pay Days over five years for stakes that are locked
for the required amount of days or more. Users that stake at least 350 days will be eligible to receive the first BPD
reward allotment, and users that stake at least 700 days will be eligible for the second, and so forth, until the fifth
BPD has been released.

The BPD contract holds the Big Pay Day tokens and releases them on the appropriate day(s) based on the stored
information and user data within the contract.

The calculations for the amount of tokens distributed across the five BPD’s are:

¢ Year 1: 10% of the tokens are distributed.
¢ Year 2: 15% of the tokens are distributed.
¢ Year 3: 20% of the tokens are distributed.
¢ Year 4: 25% of the tokens are distributed.
¢ Year 5: 30% of the tokens are distributed.

08. Ecosystem Penalties

EARLY UNSTAKES

The staking feature allows the user to unstake before the committed time in which they staked for, although the
user will incur a penalty for this action. Once a user initiates an unstake, a warning will occur to inform the user that
here will be a penalty inducted. The payout due to an early unstaker is calculated based on the days that they were
staked for- thus the payout is their principal + the summation of the payout they've received per day.

The penalty is a percentage of how early the user unstaked versus their committed time frame- the number of e
committed days left of the stake / total committed days.

For example, a user stakes 100 AXN and receives 50 AXN as their share in the payout pools for the days that they
are staked for.

The user commits to stake for 100 days, but unstakes early after day 20.

The payout penalty is 80/100 or 80% of the final payout.

The final payout is 20% of earned interest + the principal.

Only 30 AXN will be returned, which is 20% of 150 AXN.

All early unstake penalties for the day are tabulated and added to the auction pool the next day. *

» e Soe

2 ‘=
e 0022 <<<< Axion Whitepaper

The system penalizes a user for leaving their stake unattended after their committed period has ended, although
there is a grace period of 14 days.

The final payout (principal + payout) is penalized at a rate of 0.143% per day, or 1% per week.

For example, if a user’s payout of 100 AXN is available to claim at the end of a 50 day stake period, the grace period
will be from day 51 to 64 (14 days). The penalty period initiates after day 64, whereas the 0.143% is deducted from the
matured stake reward. In ~2 years, an unclaimed stake will have been lost entirely. All early unstake penalties for the
day are tabulated and added to the auction pool the next day.

09. Token Technology

eX Token

The Axion (AXN) token is an ERC20 token on Ethereum, which is the technical standard for the network. The
functionality of the token allows minting via Staking, Sub Balances, the Auction Manager, and the Auction
Contract. It is important to note that minting tokens is only permitted for required function calls.

Staking

Briefly and on a technical level, staking within the Axion code can be presented as follows:

The Stake method allows a user to stake for a maximum of 5555 days. The Unstake method allows a user to
unstake their Axion and Receive, based on the parameters below.
Thereare2mainfunctionsto calculate the stakinginterest; calculateStakingInterest &getAmountOutAndPenalty.

Token buybacks (AXN) from the Auction are sent to the Staking contract. The Make Payout function is called
once per day, which burns the bought back tokens. Once the tokens are burned, they are distributed to
stakeholders via the payout variable within the contract. The staking contract holds data from the version 1
(V1) staking contract address to allow cross compatibility between V1 and V2 contracts. The staking contract
also holds the total share supply and the total staked supply.

Auction Contract

The Axion Auction Contract operates with both Daily and Weekly auctions. Additional rewards to daily auctions
are attributed from early and late stake penalties. The daily auctions are filled via the Auction Manager.
Additional rewards for the weekly auctions are filled via previously undersold auctions, and are primarily filled
via the Auction Manager. Ethereum deposited on regular auctions is used to buy back AXN from the open
market in order to distribute them to stakeholders, and the Foundation, on an 80/20 basis.

The Venture Capital Auctions (VCA’s) occur on Tuesday and Friday of every week. VCA’s that simultaneously
land on weekly auction days will disperse additional tokens as per the contract functionality. The Auction
contract holds the data for all prior auctions in Axion'’s ecosystem.
Axion Whitepaper

(#, Auction Manager

The Auction Manager fills BigPayDays (BPD’s) with tokens (maximum 50,000,000,000) over five years. It also fills
the Auction pools with a maximum of 200,000,000,000 tokens over five years. The Auction Manager is operated
by the Foundation and secured with Gnosis Safe- the most trusted multisignature wallet on Ethereum.

[>] BPD (Big Pay Day)

The BPD contract holds the BigPayDay tokens, and stores all of the requisite information about each of the five
BigPayDays. On the day(s) of BPD, the contract transfers BPD tokens to the SubBalances contract.

6 || SubBalances

The SubBalances contract is utilized by the Staking contract to hold stake session information. The stake
session information is used to calculate BPD rewards to stakeholders. SubBalances are what pays BPD
rewards to users. The BPD rewards are only payable after stake(s) are withdrawn after the BPD (day) is over.
SubBalances also hold data from the V1 staking contract address to allow for cross compatibility between V1
and V2 contracts.

10. Marketing & Branding

Marketing our community centered and ethical finance approach is vital for Axion to achieve adoption. After the
community approved a $50,000/month marketing budget from the development fund in December 2020, Axion
hired a marketing team to roll out full scale marketing in January 2021. The Marketing team came from within the
community, bringing a strong and diverse set of marketing skills. The team rolled out a 3 phase plan to promote
Axion throughout the year 2021 with a steady increase in marketing spend. This came with core promises from
the marketing team that:

1. The Administration fee of the marketing team would be 50% Staked to Max Shares.

2. New team member onboarding would work first to build the team from within the community,
and promote contracts that include long term investments by employees.

3. There would be full transparency of marketing spend available to the community.

The underlying marketing strategy is about transforming Axion into a #BetterWaytoCrypto. This starts with
branding Axion as an Ethical Finance, Community based investment vehicle. This strategy revolves around 5
pillars, presented here:

Community Minimum 50% marketing fund staked 5555

With these 5 pillars as our guide, Axion Marketing is split into 3 phases for 2021. Phase 1 is all about asset
creation and team building, followed by our online campaign coinciding with the launch of VCA.

By focusing on our overall web presence, marketing set out to build a world class committed internal team to
execute on this plan. In Q1, Marketing launched its initial campaign with a team of 5 to announce Axion VCA to
the globe. Strategic Partnerships with Denver Digital for SEO, the onboarding of a creative director, and the
formation of an internal marketing team built from Axion investors came together. The team not only produced
and launched a full campaign in 8 weeks, but did so with a full revamp of the website and a fully released
Branding Guide viewable by the entire community.

This Branding Guide lays out the Do’s and Don'ts of Axion Marketing, including tone, audience, commitments, logo
and brand look control. This branding book serves a compass to guide the Marketing efforts, making sure that it

remains true to the ever-developing Axion brand. It is with documents like the brand book that helps separate
and distinguish Axion from the noise.

Visual Identity

With our logo and design elements, consistency is key. There are many moving parts with lots of
community-created content and features being developed on a daily basis. What will help separate official
Axion communication and development is the consistency of publicfacing branding, fonts and colors
across all mediums. All Axion Foundation websites, tools and content, whether created internally or by
third-party vendors, should follow these approved guidelines when creating and delivering content.

Design language

Axion Whitepaper

Beyond just logos and colors, the design language must be consistent. The current branding uses the
"Axion Tech" look across all its graphic design, primarily noted by a graphic with dots connected by lines
set into perspective with an "out of focus" look. This design element is blended with the Axion Blue color.
When possible, all graphic design elements should use the following or similar graphic in some manner.

AX ION

TAKING
PORTAL

Note the subtle use of the Axion Tech asset in the background of each element

Colors

As above, consistency of colors helps a user/investor recognize they're in the right spot, as a part of the
overall Axion ecosystem. Using only approved primary/secondary/accent colors is crucial to our brand.

The color palette is blue, avoid all oranges.

11. Summary

We hope that this whitepaper has shown you, a potential Axion investor, the quality of
the token that the team has created. Axion is pushing the boundaries of what’s possible
in the crypto community, and we hope that you will consider being a part of it.

From the incredible deflationary tokenomics, to the twice-weekly Bitcoin dividends,
the incredible community, and the rock-solid branding and marketing plan... There’s
something for everyone to get excited about. The following pages are packed-full of
information, from a deep dive into the mathematical mechanics of the token itself,
hypothetical investing scenarios to prove the benefits of the staking system, and
a useful glossary featuring definitions of all the crypto-lingo that you'll need as an
investor.

We're incredibly excited about where Axion is going, and we're excited to have investors
like you along for the ride.

Sincerely,
The Axion Team

Appendix

1 Axion ecosystem monitoring and control

1.1 Introduction © .
Axion was launched on 13" November 2020. The ecosystem was initially implemented using

immutable contracts, but due to the lack of flexibility and some weaknesses discovered during the

first month of operation, it was decided to change the whole system to be mutable in the so-called

“Layer2” upgrade on 17" December 2020. This decision was a gamechanger where the new system

may be continuously monitored and optimized for user’s profitability, and where new features and

services may be added.

In this session we will explain how the Axion ecosystem works in more detail using real data from
the launch and up to the current date. The data is fed into a simulation system that has the following
features:

e Playback of real data showing the history of main system parameters

e Continuous monitoring of the system performance using recent data

e Extracting statistics from historic data to simulate and predict future behavior, and if needed
use analysis and simulations to adjust parameters or functionality for optimized user’s
profitability and system longevity

The staking system is a main feature of Axion’s ecosystem, which rewards longer staking using the
LongerPaysBetter bonus mechanism. The daily interest payout to stakeholders can also be viewed as
an inflation on the token itself. It is thus vital to make sure that the ratio between liquid and staked
tokens is in optimum balance since this will have direct influence on the token exchange value which
is central to make the system profitable.

Note that the optimum interest value is dependent on several parameters and will change over time
as the ecosystem grows with more users and new services. In the next chapters it will be shown
examples on how the interest payout system works and how it can be continuously monitored and
controlled to ensure optimum balance for the investor’s longterm profitability.

Note that the future prediction examples which spans over 6 years are based on staking statistics
over a short period on time and may very well change in the future and the examples should
therefore only be used as an illustration. The main intention is to show that the Axion ecosystem has
the necessary instruments to continuously tune the system for optimum performance.

1.2 Retrospective
1.2.1 Main days

Axion Whitepaper

Axion Layer1 was launched on 13" November 2020 which will be called DayO throughout this
session. All days in this session are referred relative to DayO. Main days are

° 6" December 2020 — Day33 = Day0+33. It was discovered during the first month of

operation that the GSR update procedure was less robust to un-staking than intended and a
large GSR jump occurred on the day before Layer2 launch from 1.08 on the previous day to
1.27 which clearly demonstrated the need for a procedure upgrade.

° 7" December 2020 - Day34 = Day0+34 the Layer2 ecosystem was launched. On the launch

date GSR was set to 1.08.

° 9" December 2020 - Day36 = Day0+36 a new GSR jump from 1.09 on the previous day to

fixed at 1.09 from Day37

1.29 occurred. In order to ensure sufficient time for a robust procedure upgrade GSR was

° 5" February 2021 — Day94 = Day0+94 the new GSR procedure was launched.
e 27 February 2021 — Day106 = Day0+106 is the last day for the real data playback used in
this section for statistics and as a base for future prediction examples

1.2.2 Statistics

Figure A.1 shows the stake statistics from DayO-Day106. The upper plot shows the stake amount
distribution with an average of 25.0 Million and the largest group is from 0-50 Million. The lower plot
shows stake length distribution with an average of 1036 days. The largest group is from 1-364 days,

but a significant number is the group 5110-5555 days.

Figure A.2 and A.3 show the same statistics divided into 2 periods of DayO-Day33 and Day34-Day106.
The proportions on both amount and staking days are quite equal apart from the staking days group
of 5110-5555 day which has grown significantly between Day34-Day106. Note that the MaxShares-
5555 upgrade stakes are not included so the difference is expected to be even larger.

Figure A.9: Figure A.7 accumulated. Day0-35 Avg 0.188 %/day -> 68.7 % /year, Day35-106

The main findings are

Layer1: GSR procedure does not work well in Layer 1 and the Mega auctions give a very high
interest equivalent to 68.7 %/year which is much higher than the minimum APY of 8 %/year.
Layer2: GSR fixed to Day93 and new procedure works well from Day94-Day106. Interest is
more than half relative Layer1 but still equivalent to 30.4 %/year which is much higher than
the minimum APY of 8 %/year.

1.3 Interest effects and control

In this chapter we will show some simulation examples that illustrate how the ecosystem interest is
influenced particularly by staking strategy, auctions and BigPayDays and how it can be controlled.

In the simulations real data is included from DayO-Day106 (13 Nov.-27" Feb.) and Day37- Day106
(20 Dec. — 27" Feb.) is used to extract staking statistics which is used to drive the simulations from
Day107 to the last simulation day with similar staking statistics. The extract period is set to start
from Day37 after the last big GSR jump on Day36 to have the most correct statistics for simulating
future behavior.

The simulated stakeholders from Day107 are called:

e RealDataHolders: Random stakeholders with similar statistics as Day37-Day106
e FixedDataHolders: A set of 4 stakeholders which are used to show the interest depending on
their different staking strategies.

The FixedDataHolders are all staking 10 Million Axion and are described as:

e $1: Start stake Day107, stake 1800 days (4.93 years)

e $2: Start stake Day107, stake 300 days and the day after unstaking, restakes the total
amount (stake amount + interest) over a total of 1805 days

e $3: Start stake Day107, stake 30 days and the day after unstaking, restakes the total amount
(stake amount + interest) over a total of 1797 days

e S4: Start stake at Day472, stake 1800 days (4.93) (as S1, but start 1 year later)

Four scenarios are simulated and all contain Real data playback, RealDataHolders and
FixedDataHolders and are described by:

1. Regular auctions 300 Mill 6 days/week, buyback 240 Mill/auction — 60 days autostaking.
ScalingFactor = 1.0 (SF)

2. Regular auctions 100 Mill 4 days/week, buyback 80 Mill/auction — 60 days autostaking +
Venture Capital auctions 1 Billion 2 days/week, no Axion buyback — 120 days autostaking.
ScalingFactor = 1.0 (SF)

3. Regular auctions 100 Mill 4 days/week, buyback 80 Mill/auction — 60 days autostaking +
Venture Capital auctions 1 Billion 2 days/week, no Axion buyback — 120 days autostaking + 5

, BigPayDays (5,7.5,10,12.5,15 Billion). ScalingFactor = 1.0 (SF)

4. Regular auctions 100 Mill 4 days/week, buyback 80 Mill/auction — 60 days autostaking +
Venture Capital auctions 1 Billion 2 days/week, no Axion buyback — 120 days autostaking + 5
BigPayDays (5,7.5,10,12.5,15 Billion). 3 different ScalingFactors (equation 8): 0.999, 1.0
(current) and 1.001 which are used to control the rate of change of Global-Share-Rate.

Axion Whitepaper >>>>

The following observations are noted from the figures:

Figure A.10 GSR: The minimum GSR growth (without auctions and BigPayDays and SF=1.0)
from Day107-Day2301 is 1.103-1.784. Scenario 1 has the highest GSR of 4.11 due to the
large amounts of 1.8 Billion/week and 1.44 Billion/week buyback in the Regular auctions.
Scenario 2 has 2.4 Billion/week in auctions but only 320 Mill/week buyback since VCA has no
Axion buyback which reduces the GSR increase rate significantly to 2.12 at Day2301. The
addition of BigPayDays in Scenario 3 has very little impact on the GSR decreasing from 2.12
to 2.11 at Day2301 (due to increase in TotLiquidAxn(Day-1) in eq. 9) . In Scenario 4 we use
Scenario 3 parameters and show that the ScalingFactor may be used to change the rate of
GSR increase. An SF value of 0.999 gives a lower GSR at Day2301 than the minimum
calculated of 1.784 with SF = 1.0.

Figure A.12 Yearly (Daily x 365) payout (%): The daily payouts in Figure A.11 are converted
to equivalent yearly interest in order to illustrate the effect of the auctions and BigPayDays.
Figure A.13 Accumulated interest payout (%): The daily payouts in Figure A.12 are
accumulated to show the interest over time. An approximated average yearly interest
(calculated as the average of start and end value) in scenario 1-4 are 49.7, 28.5, 29.3 and
29.3 % respectively. The reduction in interest from Scenario 1 to 2 is significant and due to
reduced buybacks from the 4 Regular auctions and no buybacks from the Venture Capital
auctions. In scenario 3 the BigPayDays add 0.8 % interest. Note that in scenario 4 the
different GSR developments has negligible effect on the total interest payout since the effect
of GSR change only redistribute the payout proportion between stakeholders.

Figure A.14 4 different staking strategies: All scenarios show that the best strategy is S1 -
stake once for the wanted period since the Global-Share-Rate increases over time. Even S4
that starts one year later than S2 and S3 has a better outcome at the end of the stake.
Scenario 4 also shows how the scaling factor may be used to tune profitability of staking.

The main findings are:

The auction amounts and buyback factors are the main inflation/interest drivers and
reducing the Regular auctions and starting the Venture Capital auctions will reduce the
inflation significantly but will still be high with the planned amounts. An obvious control
mechanism is to reduce the auction amounts over time.

Longer staking is a better strategy for total outcome than repetitive staking-unstaking-
staking.

The scaling factor may be used as a control mechanism to change the rate of the Global
Share Rate and thus balance the profitability of staking.

Glossary

Address

A string of characters and numbers that represent a destination where crypto can be sent to or from.

AltCoin

A term used to define all crypto assets other than Bitcoin. Alt simply stands for Alternative.
ATH

All Time High - An acronym referring to the all time high price of an asset.

ATL

All Time Low - An acronym referring to the all time low price of an asset.

Arbitrage
Purchase and sale of the same asset in different markets to profit from price differences.

Audit
Comprehensive analysis of code with the intent of discovering bugs or security breaches. Audits can also be done for the economics or
legal aspects of a project

Auction

Where Axion investors enter a bid of ETH, in return for their fair share of AXN from the daily auction pool.

Bidder

A person who bids into our auctions.

Bitcoin

Founded & released in January 2009, Bitcoin is the first digital currency of its kind & ground zero for the entire crypto world as we know
it. You can earn Bitcoin simply by staking Axion!

Block

A block is a data file used for recording and storing permanent transactions pertaining to a specific network. A block records some or all
of the most recent transactions in chronological sequence. This data is a permanent record such that a block acts like a page of a ledger
or record book. Once a block is filled a new block is added which ensures that once written, the records cannot be altered or removed.

A block can be thought of as a link in an ever-growing chain of cryptocurrency transactions that are collectively known as a blockchain.

Block Height

A numeric representation showing the number of the current block being hashed.

Blockchain
A blockchain is a type of database, or ledger, that is stored electronically on a computer system in the form of data files called
blocks. These blocks allow for the sending and receiving of cryptocurrency transactions. These blocks are strung together in a “chain”

comprising millions of blocks that are constantly being added to as transactions are processed. The blockchain is decentralized allowing

public access to the data that is freely accessible to anyone and beyond the reach of a single controlling government, agency, or group.

BPD - BigPayDays
Big Pay Days are a valuable reward mechanism that was built into the Axion ecosystem to incentivize longer stakes. There are 50 billion
AXN tokens allotted to the Big Pay Days over five years for stakes that are locked for the required amount of days or more.

BuyBacks
Token BuyBacks, are a function of our auction contract. When someone bids ETH into our auctions, a portion of that ETH is instantly

used to purchase either AXN or wBTC from Uniswap, which is then used to reward stakers.

Axion Whitepaper

Centralized
Something that is controlled by a single authority or managed in one place. Examples of centralized finance include banks and Federal

Reserves, or centralized data like that owned and managed by big tech companies.

CEX
Centralized exchanges most commonly facilitate trades between users by maintaining an order book: a collection of buy and sell orders
posted by individual traders. Orders are requests to buy or sell a certain amount of a specific cryptocurrency at a certain price. CEXs

aggregate orders from their users and then use special software to match and execute the corresponding buy and sell orders.

Cold Wallet
Used to describe a crypocurrency wallet that is not connected to the internet, and thus cannot be used to process transactions without
first being reconnected (and turning into a “hot wallet”). Cold Wallets are more secure and less prone to unauthorized use.

Confirmation

In the blockchain, all transactions must be validated by 6 or more independent nodes in order to be considered “confirmed.” This
validation process proves that the action was truly intended by its submitter, preventing unauthorized transactions from being posted
to the blockchain.

Consensus
A consensus is a fault-tolerant mechanism that is used in the blockchain to achieve the necessary agreement amongst all the
decentralized processors that are computing transactions for the network. Simply put, all nodes must agree on verified transactions,

reaching a consensus.

Cryptocurrency
A form of digital currency that is secured by cryptography, making it nearly impossible to counterfeit due to the resiliency and distributed
ledger that is called the blockchain. Axion is a type of Ethereum-based cryptocurrency.

DAO
Decentralized Autonomous Organization. A DAO is a group of people or organizations that are unified in purpose such that they act as
one organizational body.

DAPP
Decentralized APPlication. A DAPP operates in such a way that it is not tied to a central governing application or database. Its main
benefits are immutability, accountability, anonymity, bandwidth, and the user maintaining total control over their personal data.

Decentralized
Owned by no one entity, government, organization, group, person, or community. Ownership is spread out to anyone and everyone

wants to join. True decentralization is possible with cryptocurrencies.

DeFi
Decentralized Finance. Meaning no one entity like a bank or government can control or have access to an individual's finances.

Deflation

Deflationary items are limited in supply and thus high in demand, resulting in an upward price/valuation movement.

DEX
Decentralized EXchange. DEXs allow cryptocurrency holders to exchange with each other directly, on a peer-to-peer basis, without
needing to trust an intermediary or centralized exchange to create the transaction.

Discord

A chat platform where most of the Axion community is based. Head to https://discord.gg/axion to join.

Dividends

Dividends are what you earn from Staking Axion, in the form of more AXN or even wBTC (Bitcoin). Often abbreviated to Divs.

DLT - Distributed Ledger Technology
DLT refers to the technological infrastructure and protocols that allows simultaneous access, validation, and record updating in an
immutable manner across a network that’s spread across multiple entities or locations.

DM

Direct Message. A message that is sent directly from one user to another on a messaging application such as Discord.

ERC-20

ERC-20 tokens are a type of cryptocurrency written for and running on the Ethereum network. Axion is a type of ERC-20 token.

ERC-721
ERC-721 tokens are smart contracts used primarily to verify the “digital uniqueness” of the piece of data it holds, such as a picture. Used

rimarily for NFT’s.
ETH - Ethereum

Ethereum (shortened to ETH) is the second largest cryptocurrency following Bitcoin based on market capacity. It was released in July of

2015 and gained widespread adoption due to its ability to run code on the blockchain in the form of “smart contracts.”

Fiat Currency
Fiat currencies are currencies that are backed by political/governmental institutions and reinforced by its global trading strength. Fiat
currencies are primarily used to pay for goods or services and are centralized around the governments that control them.

FOMO
Fear Of Missing Out. The phenomenon by which someone will choose to participate (or invest) in something not because of sound
reasoning or logic, but because they feel they will “miss out” if they do not participate. FOMO often leads to regret.

FUD

Fear Uncertainty and Doubt. It is used to refer to very dark and unsettling times regarding the future of something. Someone who

spreads FUD (FUDding) is often doing so without any supportive evidence or the ability to back up their claims and is often just

spreading rumors with the purpose of discouraging others.

Gas
Gas refers to the method of payment (often in fractions of a token) that is given to the processing nodes that are computing transactions

on the blockchain. Also referred to as Network Fees, the price by which you pay to have your transaction processed on the network.

Gas Limit
The gas limit is the maximum amount of Gas that a transaction will consume before ‘failing’, used as a safeguard to make sure that a

user does not spend more in Gas than they would like.

GitHub

A digital repository and code hosting platform for software that allows for version control and collaboration. Here is Axion’s GitHub.

GSR - Global Share Rate
The share rate of the Axion token that converts Axion into Shares during the staking process. The higher the share rate, the less shares

you receive when you stake.

Gwei
Gwei is a very small unit of the Ethereum network's Ether (ETH), represented as 1 Billionth of an Ether. Gwei is a useful unit to measure

network transaction fees, also known as Gas.

Hardware Wallet

A hardware wallet is a special type of cryptocurrency wallet which stores the user's private keys in a very secure manner, preventing
these private keys from being hacked or stolen. A transaction cannot be submitted to the blockchain without first being authenticated
by the hardware device itself, preventing fraud or unauthorized use.

Hash
A hash is a function that converts an input of letters and numbers into an encrypted output of a fixed length. A hash is created using

an algorithm and is essential to blockchain management in cryptocurrency.
Axion Whitepaper

HODL
An intentionally misspelled version of HOLD, often referred to colloquially as someone who invests with no intention of selling, no
matter how high or low the price fluctuates.

Hot Wallet
A hot wallet is a tool that allows a cryptocurrency owner to receive and send tokens by remaining connected to the internet, unlike a
cold wallet. They are inherently less secure because they can be accessed via the internet itself.

Immutable
Not susceptible to any altercation, change, manipulation, or editing after its original creation. In the blockchain, once a block is
processed, it is immutable and thus cannot ever be changed. This is why transactions on the blockchain are permanent, meaning they

cannot be erased or undone. Because of this, it is always good to verify transactions before submitting them to be processed!

Impermanent Loss

When one of the assets in a liquidity pool goes up in value compared to the other, the dollar value of the assets provided by a

liquidity miner is lower compared to just holding the initial deposit. If one of the assets doubles in price while the other stays the
same, the impermanent loss is around 5.7%.

Inflation
An increase in the price level of good relative to its economic standing. When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys
fewer goods and services and thus becomes weaker over time.

Interest
Interest, represented in % APY (or Annual Percentage Yield) is the amount your investment is paid back over time.

KYC
Know Your Customer. A set of rules laid out by the government for companies to obtain a certain amount of information from their
participants, used for fraud and tax detection.

Layer 2
Also called second layer; it is a protocol that is built on top of another protocol in order to operations to be preformed to the first layer
and manipulate the parameters of the first layer from within the second layer. Layers can continually be added, though they tend to

become more complex with each additional layer.

Ledger

Ledger is a type of Hardware Wallet used to store cryptocurrencies in a highly secure manner. With a Ledger, transactions must be
approved by physically clicking buttons on the device itself, which ensures that hackers cannot withdraw cryptocurrency without access
to the physical device and its protective password.
Liquid
When used in the sense of ‘Liquid BTC’, we mean this BTC is available to withdraw or spend immediately, its not staked.
Liquidity
Liquidity is the ability of a coin to be easily converted into cash or other coins. Axion uses significant liquidity stored on an exchange
like Uniswap to allow for simpler transactions and price stability. Liquidity also represents the health of the token, the more liquidity
the more there is available for trade.
Liquidity Mining

Also known as “software mining,” where network participants can submit their liquidity in the form of contributing equally matching

ETH and AXN to the Uniswap liquidity pool, in return for real-time bonuses in AXN tokens.

Longer Pays Better
A core component of the Axion token, Longer Pays Better means that an investor will get significantly more return on their investment
(ROI) in the form of higher APY and Bitcoin dividends by staking their investment for as long as possible, up to a maximum of 15 years.

The longer the stake, the greater the shares an investor receives, thus the better dividends.

Mainnet
Mainnet is when a blockchain protocol, such as Ethereum, is fully developed and deployed, allowing real transactions be broadcast,

verified and recorded on the blockchain.

MetaMask

MetaMask is a type of software hot wallet that allows for easy trading, swapping, and integration into websites that allow for wallet
addresses to be read. MetaMask does not store cryptocurrencies for you, it merely allows you to load or generate secret keys into the
software that are then read by or submitted to the blockchain.

Mining

Mining is the process in which computing nodes compete with each other to verify and publish transactions on the blockchain. A
successful transaction process yields payment to the node that was the first to process the transaction block to the blockchain, often
called the “block reward.”

Mutable
Opposite of immutable. Meaning it is liable or susceptible to change by being edited, adjusted or otherwise manipulated. Mutable
blocks on the blockchain would mean transactions could be reverted at best, or at worst the funds in question could be redirected to

an unauthorized address.

NFT
Non-Fungible Token. An NFT is a unit of data on the blockchain where each NFT can represent a unique digital item, and thus are not

interchangeable. NFTs can represent digital files such as art, audio, videos, items in video games and other forms of creative work.

Node

A computer/device that connects to a cryptocurrency network and helps strengthen the network's resilience by adding its processing

power to the overall group.

Nonce
Number used only ONCE. A pseudo-random number, generated in order to satisfy the parameters required by the mining and hashing
algorithms as a part of the security check.

Open Source

Software or protocols that are available to the public at no cost and can be used by anyone.

Overbid
Once our auctions have ‘sold out’, if more bids are placed and the price becomes higher than simply buying on Uniswap, we class

the auction as ‘overbid’.

Paper Wallet
Avery secure way of storing crypto in a wallet that is stored “offline” by writing the secret keys down on a piece of paper and unloading
= those keys from any software or hardware wallets until they need to be used again.

Passive Income
Income that is generated passively, without any doing on the investor's part. Healthy passive income should be the desire of any
investor, such that enough passive income generation means never having to work at a job!

_ Penalties

The fees or deductions from the value of a stake that has not been withdrawn within the withdrawal period (typically 2 weeks).

@ Private Key
The private key is a specific string of words that is used to unlock a crypto wallet. Think of a private key as the key to a house. Whoever
has the key can enter the house and add or remove any items from the house that they wish. Just as you would not share your home
key with a stranger, Private Keys should be treated with the utmost caution and should NEVER be given away to anyone, and should

especially not be photographed or otherwise stored on a computer. Write a private key down on multiple pieces of paper and store
Axion Whitepaper

Proof of Stake (PoS)
Proof of stake is a type of consensus mechanism by which a cryptocurrency blockchain network achieves distributed consensus. In
PoS-based cryptocurrencies the creator of the next block is chosen via various combinations of random selection and wealth or age vs

sheer processing power in a Proof of Work (PoW) type of consensus.

Referral
A unique URL that is generated for each wallet address connected to the Axion Staking Portal. By giving out this address, both the

referrer and the referee will receive a 10% bonus in Axion.

Ropsten
Ropsten Ethereum, also known as “Ethereum Testnet” is a testing network that runs the same protocol as Ethereum but is used for

testing purposes before deploying on the main network (Mainnet)

Satoshi Nakomoto
The mysterious pseudonym/entity that created and released the first iteration of Bitcoin, Blockchain, and Distributed Ledger technology

to the world.

Satoshi
In honor of Satoshi Nakomoto, a Satoshi is the most micro unit of splitting a bitcoin, representing 0.00000001 of a Bitcoin.

Scamcoin/Shitcoin
A colloquial terminology used to refer to crypto projects that are either poorly constructed, scammy or fraudulent, dead-end

investments, or fakes. It is generally advisable to avoid or ignore these types of coins.

Shares
Shares of ownership of Axion, given in exchange for Axion tokens. Shares generate interest and produce dividends in the form of Bitcoin

and are proportionally distributed based on amount of Axion staked and the duration of the stake term.

Smart Contract
Smart Contracts are the product of software that is run on the blockchain itself, resulting in an unalterable agreement that has
specific logic operations akin to a real-world contract. Once signed, it can never be altered. Smart Contracts are easily verifiable and

authenticated because of their persistence on the blockchain.

Stakeholder
Someone who has an active stake in Axion (represented by an amount of Shares)

Stakers Share Percentage (SSP)

The Share Percentage is how much of the Share Pool you own. If the pool has 1,000,000,000 shares in it, and you own 10,000,000 shares
yourself, you own 1% of the Share Pool.

Staking

Where AXN investors utilize their AXN tokens to earn shares by executing time-locked deposits, which in turn awards dividends over

a period of time.
Testnet
Examining and predicting price movements in the financial markets, by using historical price charts and market statistics

Technical Analysis (TA)

An online ecosystem (such as the Ropsten test network) where developers can freely interact with the code of a blockchain to experiment
around with it before launching to the Mainnet.

Tipping

A function of the Axion Discord community whereby users can tip other users (or a group of users) in actual Axion by typing !tip in the

discord chat box. Users can add or withdraw actual Axion to and from their tipping wallet like a normal software wallet. It’s pretty cool!

Token Protocol/Token
Tokens are a framework that bridges the physical and digital realms of value. ERC-20 tokens, for example, allows for interaction + access
with the Ethereum’s decentralized DAPP ecosystem, carrying both value and processing components all on the blockchain.

Tokenomics

A combination of Token and Economics. Used to address the metrics and token role within its ecosystem.

Total Supply
The absolute maximum amount of a cryptocurrency that can be produced, or “minted.”

Transaction - TX

The fee (often referred to as Gas) that a user pays in order to have their transaction processed. By paying miners to process a transaction,
it ensures security and competitiveness to the ecosystem that keeps it ever developing and ever supported. Without gas fees, the
network would fall apart due to the immense power requirements needed to process transactions.

Transaction ID - TxID
The unique ID that is assigned to a transaction. The TxID is used to access a specific transaction block and the information it holds.
When submitting a transaction on MetaMask, a TxID is generated, allowing a user to check the status of the transaction on a website

such as etherscan.io.

Trezor

Trezor is a type of Hardware Wallet used to store cryptocurrencies in a highly secure manner. With a Trezor wallet, transactions must be
approved by physically clicking buttons on the device itself, which ensures that hackers cannot withdraw cryptocurrency without access
to the physical device and its protective password.

Uniswap
Uniswap is a popular decentralized automated market maker, allowing users to interact with its liquidity pools to trade many types of
Ethereum-based tokens for other tokens. Uniswap is currently the only exchange site where you can directly purchase Axion.

VCA - Venture Capital Auction
VCA auctions are special events in the Axion ecosystem happening on Tuesdays and Fridays where 1 Billion Axion tokens are available
to buy. All investors who participate on those days immediately get 10% of their bid returned as liquid Bitcoin, with 85% of the auction

value being distributed to active stakers as Bitcoin.

Wallet

The digital equivalent to a real world wallet, used to store cryptocurrencies. Readily available software allows users to store their
cryptocurrencies on the blockchain and be accessed through their crypto wallet. Wallet types vary, including types like paper wallets,
web wallets, desktop wallets, hardware wallets, and mobile wallets.

WBTC (tokenized Bitcoin)
Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) is an ERC-20 token that represents Bitcoin (BTC) on the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum and Bitcoin are not
compatible tokens as they run on entirely different types of networks. So wBTC allows Bitcoin to enter the Ethereum network and be

used in Ethereum wallets, dapps, and smart contracts.

Whale

The term used to refer to an investor who carries a very high net worth of crypto. A whale typically owns sufficiently enough of a
cryptocurrency such that their decisions as what to do with it on the open markets would directly and noticeably impact the assets
trading price should they sell or buy. Whales generally move into and out of crypto projects in very noticeable ways.

Whitepaper

The foundational a report or guide that is used to inform the public of a project's specifications; equivalent of a business prospectus
or plan, but used to describe the crypto project itself. Generally speaking, the amount of time and care given to a crypto’s whitepaper
is indicative of the quality of the crypto itself. Axion prides itself in its whitepaper.

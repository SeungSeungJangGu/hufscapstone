1. Introduction

Investors looking to broaden their scope should not omit an evolving investment asset such as digital
currency. The growth rate of cryptocurrency price has led to total market capitalisation valued at
148 billion dollars at present and it keeps growing on a daily basis.

Decentralised cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (the first of its kind) are not regulated by corporate or
government structure and have no backing of other firms, banks or corporate entities that hold
assets measured in digital currency. Yet the current trend of initial token sale is the most favoured
practice to release a new coin on the trade market, being backed up by project or new technology.

UQUID Coin (UQC) is a public fund gathering governed by the UQUID System. UQC token sale is
aimed to further develop UQUID System and provide its customers with an enhanced user
experience, represented by an instant liquidity UQUID Eco System for Bitcoin and Altcoins.

Some specifics of the UQC ICO dictate the need for tokens to be stored in ERC20 compatible e-
wallets. Token subscription will be offered to Venture Capital funds and investors with a sizable
discount (premium and discount are antonyms in finance and could potentially cause a confusion)
pre public offering stage. For the first 18 days of trading, UQC will be offered at less than the
subscription discount. Tokens will be announced for purchase on WWW.UQUIDCOIN.COM.

Unfortunately the current offering will not be available to buyers within the territory of the United
States of America.

2.2. Global Mission & Corporate Values
The UQUID system has already proven a cunning entry on the coin marker by laying a foundation of
what is next to come. By successfully completing its initial strategic milestones, UQUID has only
provided a favour to its customers, of how effortless it could be to connect altcoins with our current
financial system.

Having set a core focus of “putting the customer first”, UQUID continues building on and developing
its platform to utilise new features that will benefit its users. The philosophic approach that UQUID
adheres to is an “All-In-One Solution”, universal, practical and easy to use. The platform has evolved
and will continue changing, to continuously improve the customer experience.

The UQC ICO will enable UQUID System to accelerate the building of an Eco System that will deploy
features covering all major market and user needs and building a stable bridge between the two
economic environments and supporting instant coin liquidity. Development of this platform and
most importantly getting this service ready for customer use, require a strong capital backing
through the UQUID Coin Fund Raising Campaign.

In its pioneer endeavour, UQUID has worked hard to research the market needs and introduce many
unique features. Taking more than a year to develop and test the main system platform, UQUID has
incorporated the highest level of virtual protection, to provide its customers with a safe online
environment. The technology used in the platform can rival the capacity of large international
corporations.

Multi-layer security Protocols are used to protect customers’ accounts and offer a proprietary
hashing method, secured password and pin to ensure security. The 2FA Feature provides even
further protection, making the UQUID system rigid and unyielding to cyber attacks.

new joining coins are to already have an existing lifespan of over 6 months, whilst exceptions will be

4.2.1.Multi-Currency E-Wallet
Being the first in the world to issue an altcoin Debit Card, UQUID is also introducing the multi e-
wallet, giving customer’s convenience of storing Bitcoin’s, altcoin or fiat currencies directly on the
system.

Figure 11: Multi Currency e-wallet

Storing assets on virtual carriers, provides lack of confidence and security concerns, especially
related to the storage on mobile devices. To avoid customer dissatisfaction and plausible uncertainty
related to security threats, UQUID has adopted the latest multi-signature technology that provides
an advanced privacy-protection, with a two-factor authentication system and an anti-phishing
protection.

The multi signature e-wallet technology consists of three keys: one held by the security provider,
one held by the user, and one held on behalf of the user by a third-party Key Recovery Service (KRS).
Every transaction is authorised by two signatures: the user and the Service Provider where the
Service Provider will not co-sign a double spend. This leaves only the user and the KRS to double
spend. The Service Provider has set up a prevention campaign of double spent that liaise with any
KRS used, to give a notice period prior to any signatures it makes.

UQUID customers can be assured that their Bitcoin or altcoin will be stored securely on their UQUID
e-wallets. The capabilities of the UQUID mobile app will not only provide e-wallet storing for 200
coins, but also a range of fiat currency.

4.2.2.UK E-Money Licence

To further diversify the freedom of payment methods available to our customers, UQUID will require
an FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) authorisation. UQUID’s global strategy has planned to start the
FCA accreditation process immediately after the ICO completion.

4.2.3.Real Time Spent

Having implemented the multi-currency e-wallet, customers will now be able to deposit and store
their currencies for free on the UQUID e-wallet. When shifting assets from the wallet to the card,
two main fees will apply:

e 0.1% fee of the transferred amount when using UQUID Coin
e 0.5 % of transferred amount when any other currencies, fiat or crypto used

Real Time Spend is a unique, first of its kind system that enables further simplifying of the steps
described above. This system will allow the user to access their wealth on the go, bringing great
untapped value to these assets and eliminating the need of preloading the UQUID Card.

With the implementation of this system, users would only need to follow a simplified process of two
steps:

1) Deposit currency and or coins to the UQUID multi sign e-wallet
2) Pay or Purchase by UQUID Plastic or Virtual Card

Transfers between wallet and card will occur automatically, only on payment demand and will be

governed by the Real Time Spent System (RTSS). During the operation of RTSS, the multi signature e-
wallet protocol will be triggered instantaneously, as part of the security protocol and protection.

4.3. Stage 3: Exchange

The ability of the UQUID e-wallet to store together coins and fiat currencies has driven the need to
incorporate another unique feature in to the crypto station.

Figure 16: Stage 3 Time Plan

Focusing on “the customer first”, UQUID system with an integrated trading platform, will provide its
customers with the opportunity to benefit from instant assets liquidity previously stored in the
UQUID e-wallet, as well as instant cash out.

Conventional trading platforms provide users with so called hot e-wallets to store their assets. This is
a major security compromise, especially when holding big amounts. The user is exposed to a direct
risk of losing all assets. UQUID has addressed these issues by providing its customer with multi key e-
wallets, as described in the section above.

Blockchain trading platform, combined with capabilities to trade/exchange fiat currency, is an
enterprise that requires a great deal of expertise and development. In order for us to provide clients
with a trading platform that will be tailored to our clients’ needs and gathered feedback, UQUID
intends to build a tailored system from the ground up that will deliver the required Features.
Furthermore, whilst creating this algorithmically complex system, the most important elements to
consider will be security, reliability and user confidentiality. To do so, the most up-to-date security
trends will be implemented to provide its users with a secure trading environment.

4.4. Stage 4: Investing

In conjunction with UQUID Trading Platform (UQTC) launch, a Social Fund Management Campaign
will start. Following the blockchain idea of decentralisation and asset transfer freedom, the UQUID
System have planned to release a Social Coin Management Fund (SCMF) feature.

Figure 18: Stage 4 Time Plan

Once completely built and developed, these systems will be available as a part of the trading
platform. It will be possible for non UQUID users to access the Social Coin Manager, but only for
viewing purposes.

Once logged in to the SCMF system, users will be able to link their accounts to the UQTP and
maintain this automatically.

In the SCMF, successful traders will be able to build a portfolio and view their rate of success.
Depending on the overall profitability, the trader will be awarded with an Investment rating. Should
their rating be sufficiently high, they will be given the option to share the content of their portfolio
with less experienced traders. If both parties agree, the less experienced trader will pay a minor
percentage from their newly acquired portfolio returns.

Once the trader has engaged in tracking the portfolio of the experienced user, the less experienced
investor will be able to provide feedback to the original portfolio creator, which will be visible to all
other system users.

UQUILI

The rating system introduced will review the investors trading history, focusing on successfully
executed transactions, the age of the account and amount of positive feedbacks of sale profitability.

Account Age Min 2 weeks | 1month | 2months | 3 months | 5 months
Feedback 0 10 50 100 500

Table 3: Rating Criteria

The rating criteria as such, will encourage the main idea of the SCMF, where only members with over
four star rating will be able to share their portfolios.

In trading to secure great returns, constant market monitoring will be necessary. Recognising the
need of being informed in real time, UQUID will provide its users with daily Bitcoin updates. Even a
special statistic tool will be available to advice of when it is best to sell or buy coins. This will also act
as investment protection protocol. Once the price drops sharply or below a certain point, the system
will alert the user that it is time to sell now to avoid losses.

Another very important feature will be the ICO Display. All future and newly released ICO’s, will be
viewable on this display. In this way, UQUID SCMF will keep its users constantly updated with what is
coming and what are the potential investment opportunities.

the e-wallet. UQCSS will allow its users to pay directly with their preferred coins when purchasing
online from Amazon, eBay and other e-commerce organisations.

Based on successful completion of ICO #1 and CO#2 UQUID have planned to develop and release this
great feature to its customers by November 2020.

This feature will allow any coin owners to transfer coins or cash to other users, accounts or end
destinations. When UQS receives the payment request and the coins have been deposited to UQS,
the UQS will forward the request to partner platforms. Once the request has been received, the
partner system will transfer the money to the requested end destination.

Usually, such transfers will take time before all parties have reviewed the senders request and
authorised it. This time lag will usually occur when altcoins or Bitcoins have been deposited. When
senders use UQC the payment request will be processed instantly.

5. UQUID Coin Fund Raising

UQC is a decentralised virtual currency based on the ERC20 - token; one of the Ethereum
developed Technological Trends. The goal of this blockchain asset is to supplement the
development of UQUID Ecosystem. In this virtual revolution, coin holders will have the benefit of
instantly and effortlessly cash out their coins.

UQUID System provides value added services for digital assets that are linked to the traditional
economy, but far more efficient and cheaper for the consumer. This type of crypto currency
supported by a leading organisation lowers down the risk of coin price volatility and raises the
token demand. Investors in UQUID Coin will benefit from instant liquidity at 0% risk trading
environment.

Capital gathered will be used to supplement the development of the UQUID project (Appendix 2)
Why have we have chosen Ethereum blockchain?

1. Security and predictability (as opposed to, for example, having to run an independent
blockchain network);

2. Use of robust and well- supported clients (Ethereum- based tokens can be managed with
official Ethereum clients):

3. High liquidity (interchangeable with other Ethereum- based tokens or Ether);

4. Easier listing on exchanges with infrastructure already in place;

5. Ethereum smart contracts enable a very transparent and secure way of profit sharing among
the token holders.

6. ERC20 defines a set of six functions that other smart contracts within the Ethereum ecosystem
will understand and recognize.

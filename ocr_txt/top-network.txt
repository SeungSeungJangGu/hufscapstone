TOP Decentralized Open Communication Network

1. Introduction

TOP Network is a decentralized open communication network powered by blockchain 4.0 technology. It
provides decentralized cloud communication services such as messaging, VoIP, video, streaming, VPN,
CDN, loT data sharing, storage and more. With the API and SDK provided by TOP Network, developers
can build communication applications - for instance, messaging apps like WhatsApp and WeChat, VoIP
apps like Skype, VPN services like SkyVPN, and live streaming apps, without developing their own
communication stacks and deploying their own networks. TOP Network can significantly lower
development costs and network costs for developers. Furthermore, all the applications running on TOP
Network are interoperable, while apps such as WeChat, WhatsApp and Telegram, built on top of
proprietary protocols, are completely isolated from each other. On this decentralized and distributed P2P
overlay network, nodes mine TOP tokens by providing communication services to the network instead of
through proof of work (POW) mechanism that consumes large amounts of energy.

TOP is a high-performance public blockchain platform designed to process massive real-world business
on the blockchain. Communication services usually have a huge volume of high-frequent, real-time
transactions. For example, a popular messaging app might have approximately 100 billion messages per
day‘8e4), equivalent to one million messages per second. Every transaction needs to be processed on the
blockchain in real time. The existing blockchain platforms on the market, such as Ethereum and the so-
called blockchain 3.0-powered EOS, cannot handle such a massive volume of transactions. TOP Chain
adopts innovative technologies including double lattices to organize transactions, directed acyclic graph
structure to organize blocks, two-layered sharding, high-speed concurrent Practical Byzantine Fault
Tolerance (PBFT) consensus mechanism, and trusted off-chain processor. The core mission of a
blockchain 4.0 platform is to enable the real-world business of any volume or size on the blockchain. The
TOP main chain will have the capability to handle several hundred thousand transactions per second
(TPS). With the seamless combination of main chain, service chains and off-chain processors, TOP can
process millions of business transactions in a second.

TOP Token, the native and basic cryptocurrency in the TOP ecosystem, is used for the settlement of
communication services on TOP Network and asset transactions on the TOP public blockchain platform.
Service nodes on TOP Network mine TOP Tokens by providing communication services, and consensus
nodes of TOP blockchain platform mine TOP Tokens by verifying transactions. Moreover, the voting
power of a consensus node in PBFT-DPoS consensus mechanism is directly related to the number of
TOP Tokens the node holds. In addition to the native TOP Token, any Dapp can issue its own token on
TOP through the TRC20 protocol. Therefore, tokens can be created through initial coin offering (ICO) and
can be exchanged freely on TOP.

Bitcoin revolutionarily kicked off the world of cryptocurrency and Ethereum started a new era of Web 3.
However, a brand-new generation of infrastructure is desperately needed to make Web 3 reality. EOS
TOP Decentralized Open Communication Network

may become a popular general-purpose blockchain platform for Dapps, and IPFS (InterPlanetary File
System) is likely to become the decentralized storage infrastructure. TOP Network is aimed to serve as
the network infrastructure for communications and social applications in the Web 3 era.

1.1 Background

Before the Internet era, people-to-people and device-to-device communication solutions were limited to a
few choices, such as short messaging, phone call, telegram and walkie-talkie. After the advent of the
Internet, the open, real-time and high-efficient TCP/IP protocol made it possible for people to build brand-
new communication applications. Later, broadband Internet was widely adopted, and bandwidth was no
longer a bottleneck. With the quick progress in encoding and decoding technology for digital audio and
video and the boom in audio/video peripheral devices, means of communication rapidly transformed from
text messaging and data sharing to multimedia solutions including VoIP call, video call and video
conference. Nowadays, rich multimedia communication has become one of the most critical applications
on the Internet.

In the era of Mobile Internet, the smartphone is a perfect audio/video/photo device which can access the
Internet anytime and anywhere. New communication applications such as mobile messaging and live
streaming have become popular. Particularly, messaging apps offer better user experience than
traditional phone calls and SMS without charging consumers a fee. Furthermore, taking advantage of the
address book on users’ mobile phones, messaging apps have evolved from communication tools to social
networks offering communication services. With its massive user base, strong user stickiness and long
user engagement time, messaging apps have become a platform with huge traffic and evolved into an
independent ecosystem.

Today, the era of loT is around the corner. A massive number of loT devices need to exchange data and
communicate with each other. Also, the high-speed, low-latency 5G mobile Internet is expected to not
only facilitate communications but also catalyze the development of new communication applications
such as loT, ultra high definition video and virtual reality (VR).

All communication applications are built on a communication network infrastructure. A popular messaging
app requires a large number of servers to deliver messages, video, photos and voice calls. Apps for live
streaming, VR, and streaming video tend to consume much more bandwidth compared with other apps,
therefore demanding more servers and better networks. A robust communication network is absolutely
necessary to achieve data exchange among massive loT devices. Deploying, operating and maintaining
a global network requires a profound understanding of the network technology and substantial capital
investment to cover the high cost. When the traffic on a communication app increases, the underlying
network capacity needs rapid expansion, driving the cost even higher. A good example is Dingtone, a
partner with TOP Network. To serve more than 36 million global users, Dingtone has to deploy a large
number of communication servers on dozens of global backbone networks and hundreds of edge
networks around the world and establish interconnections with telecom operators in almost every country.
TOP Decentralized Open Communication Network

Communication networks, the infrastructure for communication apps, should be open, secure and
interoperable. Privately owned communications networks often have serious security issues as
communications between users may be blocked, intercepted, filtered or even leaked, putting user privacy
at risk. Private communication networks usually use private communication protocols, making it
impossible for communication apps to interconnect with each other. For example, a WeChat user cannot
send messages to a WhatsApp user, and vice versa.

Using a Communication as a Service (CaaS) is much more affordable compared to deploying in-house
communication network. CDN is one of the typical CaaS networks. TOP Network offers a decentralized
CaaS network that is cheaper and safer than existing CaaS networks.

The emerging blockchain technology and token economics make it possible to build a secure, open and
low-cost decentralized communication network. Supported by distributed network technology, TOP
Network allows any device (server, computer and CPE) to serve as a node on TOP Network to provide
communication services and receive token rewards based on bandwidth contribution or other metrics.
Providing communication service on TOP is equivalent to mining tokens. The consensus mechanism at
the service level ensures all communication services provided by miners are validated and accurate,
while the consensus mechanism on the blockchain level guarantees the integrity and accuracy of booking
and settlement. End-to-end encryption ensures that the communication among users cannot be
monitored or censored during transmission. Since TOP Network adopts international standard
communication protocols such as RCS and RTP/RTCP, apps on TOP are interoperable with any apps
that follow the same standard protocols. TOP Network is not owned by any person or centralized
organization. It is low-cost, secure and unstoppable.

TOP Network, a distributed communication network built and maintained by the community, provides full-
stack cloud communication services. TOP Network is designed to be a public communication network
infrastructure for any app.

1.2 Mission Statement

Our mission is to build a public communication network infrastructure that provides secure, open, and
affordable communication services for all apps. TOP will allow app developers to build and deploy
communication apps in a simple, easy and low-cost manner. Envisioning an interconnected world, we will
enable all communication apps to connect to each other by promoting open communication protocols on
TOP Network.

In addition, we aim to build TOP Messenger, a blockchain-based, decentralized messaging app with
features and functions similar to WhatsApp and WeChat. A social communication app supporting
payment in cryptocurrency, TOP Messenger seamlessly integrates into one app an array of functions:
social network, community, communication, digital asset management (Wallet), digital currency payment
and decentralized cryptocurrency exchange. A secure decentralized app on TOP Network, TOP
TOP Decentralized Open Communication Network

Messenger protects users from censorship and data privacy violation. TOP Messenger offers a better
user experience in digital currency payment and peer-to-peer exchange compared to the existing apps.

Every communication service on TOP Network has a huge potential market size. Taking the VPN
business as an example: the global VPN market is projected to reach $106 billion by 2022 (82). We
expect the value of TOP Token to gain momentum in future thanks to the enormous volume of
communication services carried on TOP Network. We are working together with the entire TOP
community to achieve a win-win situation that benefits developers, users, token holders and miners.
TOP Decentralized Open Communication Network

2. TOP Overview

The Telos Protocol, also known as TOP, is specifically designed for the distributed communication
network. TOP is a suite of communication service protocols and underlying networking protocols including
peer-to-peer (P2P) networking protocol, network sharding protocol, network routing protocol, domain
name service (DNS), distributed data synchronization protocol and data transmission encryption protocol.
TOP Network, a distributed communication network built on the Telos Protocol, provides distributed cloud
communication services. TOP public blockchain platform, also known as TOP Chain, is based on the
Telos Protocol as well. TOP Chain is a general-purpose blockchain platform although it is initially
designed for bookkeeping and settlement for the communication services on TOP Network. In short, TOP
Network provides communication services while TOP Chain supports bookkeeping and settlement for the
services.

TOP Decentralized Open Communication Network

TOP is an ecosystem for cloud communication services. Miners, developers, Dapp and end users are the
primary participants in the ecosystem. TOP Tokens is the native cryptocurrency for the economic
activities on TOP. The underlying infrastructure layer of TOP has four components:

1) TOP Communication Network: a distributed network for cloud communication services.

2) TOP Storage Network: a distributed network for storage service.

3) TOP Chain: a distributed ledger.

4) TOP Off-chain: a trusted off-chain processor.

2.1 Core Values of TOP

2.1.1 Distributed Communication Cloud Services

First, TOP is a platform that provides real services instead of only financial settlement. TOP Network
offers low cost, secure and interoperable cloud communication services on the blockchain, including
messaging, calling, video, CDN, VPN, streaming, loT data sharing, storage and more. Any app can
access the network via TOP API or SDK.

The TOP decentralized communication network is built and run by the global community. Any person or
organization can contribute servers, storage and bandwidth to the network. No individual or organization
controls the network and no middleman profits from the cloud communication services. Community
members typically contribute idle resources, such as a spare server in a data center, to the network. End
users can also contribute their devices to the network. The marginal cost of those spare resources is
close to zero. Fully automated and self-administered, the network requires no manual operation or
maintenance. As a result, the cost of TOP Network is far lower than that of private networks or in-house
networks

TOP SDK provides a full set of frameworks for communication apps development. Modules in the SDK
include audio and video signal processing, codec, special effect, network IO, customizable user interface
templates and so on. The entire SDK is open-source so developers can modify the SDK freely to meet
their specific needs, significantly lowering costs and shorten the development process.

By adopting end-to-end encryption technology for data transmitted on the network, TOP secures every
user’s privacy against data interception and censorship.

In a nutshell, the core values of TOP Network are decentralization, low cost, security, privacy protection
and interoperability.

2.1.2 High - Performance Public Blockchain Platform for Real Business

Bookkeeping and settlement of the cloud communication services on TOP Network require a distributed
ledger and smart contract platform. Communication services generate extremely high volumes of
transactions and a typical transaction carries a small amount of value. In fact, many real-world businesses
such as gaming and social networking have similar situations. Currently, all the existing public blockchain
TOP Decentralized Open Communication Network

platforms cannot handle transactions of such high volumes at a reasonable cost. The TOP blockchain
platform is designed to tackle the challenge with an innovative three-layer chain architecture that consists
of the main chain, multiple service chains and trusted off-chain processors. Powered by innovative
blockchain technologies such as two-layer lattices for transaction organization, two-layer sharding for
consensus network, high-speed Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus mechanism, TOP
can process several hundred thousand of transactions per second (TPS) and offer instant confirmation of
transactions and zero transactions fees. TOP is specially designed to process on the blockchain the real-
world businesses of any complexity, volume and size.

2.1.3 Open Ecosystem

TOP is not just a platform, but an open ecosystem where miners, Dapps, developers, end users and
communities work together. Each player can benefit from the ecosystem. For instance, developers can
use the open-source modules provided by TOP developer community as building blocks for their apps.
End users receive token rewards for their use of Dapps. Miners earn tokens for contributing resources
and services to the system.

2.2 Token Economics

TOP Token is the currency that connects all the parties of the TOP ecosystem. The token economics
shall drive the economic growth in the TOP ecosystem. Since TOP actually has two independent and
interconnected platforms - TOP Network for cloud communication services and TOP public blockchain
platform, there exists two separate but interconnected token economies: one for cloud communication
services the other for the public blockchain platform.

1) Service Fee of Communication Services

The distributed cloud communication services offered by TOP Network are not free. The owner of the
Dapp (that is, the Dapp developer) needs to pay the miners who provide the actual communication
services based on the workload and the settled price. For example, assuming the settled price of
VPN service is 1 TOP Token/1GB data, a VPN app (the developer) needs to pay 0.5 TOP Token to
the nodes providing the VPN service after a VPN user consumes 0.5GB data. In the real world, each
service session usually involves multiple nodes (in the case of VPN service, a VPN session requires
at least 4 nodes to participate), and the service fee should be allocated among all the participating
nodes according to certain metrics.

If a Dapp is completely decentralized and owned by no one, then it is the end users of the Dapp who
should pay the miners directly. However, such a situation is rare.
2) Market Pricing Mechanism for Communication Services

TOP Network is not owned or operated by any organization. Therefore, the prices of services on TOP
Network are not defined by a central pricing authority. Instead, TOP Marketplace, a decentralized
market realized through smart contracts, connects Dapps with miners and matches their ask prices
and bids. The Marketplace allows miners to submit their quotations and Dapps to make inquiries. It

10
TOP Decentralized Open Communication Network

then automatically matches Dapps and service nodes according to price, service quality and other
factors, and creates contracts for the matched parties.

Token Mining

The consensus nodes on the main chain can mine TOP Tokens by verifying transactions and
producing blocks. Half of the remaining minable tokens are available to be mined every four years,
which means 4.75% of the tokens can be mined each year in the first four years, then 2.375% per
year in the second four years, and so on.

Token Issuing and Burning

Some communication cloud services on TOP Network should be free. For instance, it is
counterproductive and meaningless to charge a service fee for messaging service, because the cost
of charging a fee to a single message on the blockchain ledger far exceeds the cost of delivering the
message itself. However, nodes providing messaging service still need to be rewarded. In addition,
some nodes on the TOP main chain such as Edge nodes and Advanced nodes do not participate in
the mining process and cannot benefit from mining, but they deserve incentives in a certain way.

To incentivize the nodes that do not benefit from mining or service fees, TOP automatically issues 1%
to 2% of TOP tokens each year to reward those nodes based on their contributions to the ecosystem.

TOP blockchain platform does not charge transaction fees (i.e., gas fee) for general transactions, but
it does require payments for certain types of transactions or resources including high-value
transactions, high-frequency transactions, account registration and the deployment of smart
contracts. The tokens received from these fees are not used to reward nodes, but instead are burned
to offset the additional tokens issued each year, keeping the total number of tokens in the system flat
or a little bit lower in the system.

Deposit and Benefits

Holding a certain amount of deposit is a basic requirement for a device (a server, computer or CPE)
to join TOP Network as a communication service provider (service node) or a consensus node on the
main chain. TOP adopts delegated proof of stake combined with PBFT-DPoS consensus algorithm. A
node holding a larger deposit is more likely to be selected as the consensus node in a shard.
Similarly, a service node has better chances to be selected by the Marketplace to serve Dapps if it
has larger deposits.

A Dapp also needs to hold deposit to access TOP Network. Although messaging service is free, a
messaging Dapp should have enough deposit to be eligible to utilize the service. Deploying smart
contracts, reserving RAM and even sending a payment all requires a deposit.

Deposit means benefit or privilege, which is the core of the token economics. As the ecosystem
grows, more tokens are deposited, reducing the total number of tokens in circulation. Deposit
requirement can also reduce spam and DDoS attack efficiently.

User Contribution and Token Rewards

End users in the TOP ecosystem can receive token rewards for their use of Dapps and their
contribution to the ecosystem. Dapps can design benefit policies to reward users for holding tokens.

11
TOP Decentralized Open Communication Network

For example, after holding a certain number of tokens for a certain period, users may get extra
benefits such as special discounts or access to special functions and services on the Dapps.

2.3 TOP Architecture Overview
2.3.1 Network Layer

The network layer, the physical infrastructure layer of TOP, is a P2P network provided and maintained by
miners. It has three sub-networks.

1) TOP Chain consists of a main chain and multiple service chains. It provides ledger, payment
service and cryptocurrency for the TOP ecosystem.

2) TOP off-chain is a processor and ledger that stores and processes business data off the chain in
a trustworthy manner to reduce the workload and frequency of data processing on the blockchain
ledgers.

3) TOP Network consists of two parts: TOP Communication Network, a distributed network for
communication service, and TOP Storage Network, a distributed network for storage service.

2.3.2 Service Layer

TOP Network provides distributed cloud communication services and distributed storage services. TOP
Chain offers payment service, smart contracts and other on-chain services.

2.3.3 Interface Layer

TOP Network provides communication services for Dapp through its APIs and SDKs. TOP Network also
provides cross-chain bridges to export its communication services to other blockchain platforms.

2.3.4 Marketplace

TOP Marketplace, a decentralized market built on smart contracts, allows miners to register their services
and offer quotations and enables Dapps to submit queries and choose service providers that meet their
specific requirements.

2.3.5 Dapp

Dapp is an application built and deployed on TOP. Since TOP has two platforms - distributed cloud
communication platform and a public blockchain platform, Dapps on TOP fall under two categories:

1) Apps using distributed cloud communication services provided by TOP
2) Apps only interacting with smart contracts deployed on TOP Chain

12
TOP Decentralized Open Communication Network

3. TOP Chain

Most public blockchain platforms on the market today are designed for value transfer or financial
transactions instead of for supporting real-world businesses that involve far more complex logic and
workflow. In addition, many businesses require complicated data structures and generate a large amount
of data and high-volume transactions. Communication service is a typical example of real-world
businesses that have to process high-volume service transactions instantly. It is super challenging for a
blockchain to settle such an enormous volume of business in real time, a task that none of the existing
blockchain platforms can handle. The ultimate processing capability of a blockchain, in terms of
transactions per second (TPS), is constrained by the network bandwidth between nodes despite the
application of Vertical Scale-Up or Horizontal Scale-Out strategy. The network throughput between nodes
in the permissionless public Internet is limited in practice. To mitigate the scalability issue, some
blockchain platforms such as EOS attempt to use a few permission-based nodes to execute consensus
algorithms on behalf of the entire network, which compromises the principle of decentralization on the
blockchain.

As a general-purpose blockchain platform starting from supporting communication and social networking
services, TOP is specifically designed to handle complex real-world businesses on the blockchain. To
process complicated, high-volume business data, TOP needs to address the following key issues:

1) Capability to support complex business logic on the blockchain

As real-world businesses have their unique business logic and different business data structures,
it is impractical for a single blockchain to accommodate all the businesses. Instead, TOP is
designed to be pluggable so that new businesses can easily move to a blockchain.

2) Capability to process and store large amounts of data

Many businesses generate large amounts of data, and usually not all of these data should be
processed and stored on the blockchains. On TOP blockchain platform, most business data are
processed and stored by off-chain processors in a trusted manner. Only the aggregated data are
uploaded to the blockchains.

3) Capability to process huge volumes of transactions

Although off-chain processors can process large amounts of business data, the volume of
business transactions submitted to blockchains can still be enormous. For example, the cloud
communication services on TOP Network are expected to generate tens of thousands of
transactions every second in its early stage. Thus, a single chain on TOP blockchain platform
should be able to handle at least tens of thousands of transactions per second.

4) Instant confirmation of transactions

Most real-world business settlements need to be completed in real time to ensure a positive user
experience. TOP blockchain platform uses unit lattice (i.e., transaction lattice) data structure

13
TOP Decentralized Open Communication Network

organize transactions and employs PBFT-DPoS consensus mechanism to validate transactions.
These techniques allow TOP to settle transactions promptly.

5) Zero transaction fees

For the real-world businesses, especially communication services, the settlement price of each
service transaction can be very low. Should a blockchain be used as a value transfer platform for
such businesses, the platform shall not charge any transaction fee. Otherwise, it would be
uneconomical for a business to be deployed and settled on the blockchain.

6) Secure and flexible smart contracts

Implementing complex business logic requires powerful smart contracts. Smart contracts built on
Turing complete languages are flexible but may be vulnerable to cyber attacks. TOP blockchain
platform supports both Turing complete and non-Turing complete smart contracts that serve
different purposes, providing flexible and secure smart contracts to accommodate various use
cases.

TOP Blockchain Platform Architecture:

Smart Contract

The TOP blockchain platform is a three-layer architecture: one main chain, multiple service chains, and
off-chain processors. The main chain manages the initialization, registration and discovery of service

14
TOP Decentralized Open Communication Network

chains and provides account management, chain clock and address space for service chains. The main
chain does not rely on service chains or participant in the transaction processing on any service chain.
Instead, the main chain is only responsible for the financial settlement. Since different types of
businesses have unique business logic and could generate transactions of different volume and data
structures, a service chain is designed to process a specific type of business and can choose any
consensus mechanism and data structure. For instance, on TOP Network, VPN service is processed on
the Proxy Service Chain, while CDN service is processed on the CDN Service Chain. To add a new type
of business to the ecosystem, TOP creates on demand a new service chain tailored to the customized
consensus mechanism and the specific business workflow. The off-chain processors handle and store
business data on the off-chain network to reduce the amount and frequency of data processed and stored
on the chain.

TOP blockchain platform offers two types of smart contracts: Platform Contract for asset transaction and
Service Contract for cloud communication services. Platform Contract and Service Contract are executed
separately in the isolated virtual machine (VM) environments, a method that ensures both flexibility and
security.

By taking advantage of both directed acyclic graph (DAG) data structure and block data structure, TOP
Chain uses unit lattice structure to organize transactions and block lattice structure to synchronize
account states. This dual lattice architecture is one of the key technologies to achieve fast confirmation of
transactions and efficient cross-shard and cross-zone state synchronization. Compared to other DAG-
based public blockchain platforms, TOP Chain is far more decentralized and therefore much safer and
faster.

3.1 TOP Blockchain Architecture

So far, the processing capacity of any existing blockchain platform is too low compared with that of most
centralized systems. Worse still, the transaction confirmation process on the existing blockchain platforms
is also very slow. As a result, the blockchain platforms available on the market can hardly be used to
process real businesses except for limited, experimental financial applications. Nowadays, blockchain
platforms powered by new-generation technology are emerging, many of which attempt to find unique
ways to improve transaction processing capacity significantly. One method is to improve the efficiency of
the consensus mechanism. Besides that, the following two strategies can also improve the transaction
processing capacity of public blockchains:

1) Vertical Scale-Up

The vertical scale-up strategy requires each node to have powerful computing power, large
throughput bandwidth and huge memory. As all individual nodes have sufficient processing
capacity, the entire system can process a large number of transactions. However, in a completely
permissionless network, nodes vary in their computing power and network bandwidth capacity,
making it difficult for all nodes to meet the same high requirements. Thus, the vertical scale-up
strategy mainly exists on the permissioned networks or federated blockchains where only a few

15
TOP Decentralized Open Communication Network

high-performance nodes participate in the consensus process. A typical example is EOS, a semi-
decentralized blockchain platform.

Blockchains based on the permissioned networks achieve high scalability but sacrifice
decentralization, violating the principle of blockchain for distributed computing and inevitably
hurting their trustability. Moreover, the consensus networks on such blockchains, less secure and
more vulnerable to cyber attacks compared with those on the utterly decentralized blockchain,
can be shut down by the government easily in the name of law enforcement.

Horizontal Scale-Out

Sharding is the principal technique used in the horizontal scale-out strategies. The consensus
network is divided into several groups, and consensus nodes in each group can verify and
confirm transactions in parallel. If the number of shards is carefully calibrated, sharding can
improve blockchain performance effectively. However, when the number of shards reaches a
certain point, the number of cross-shard transactions increases significantly so the processing
capacity of the entire system stops improving. Some blockchain projects claim in their
whitepapers that they can support infinite sharding, which is impossible to realize.

The ultimate processing capacity achieved with the horizontal scale-out strategy is limited by the
network bandwidth throughput of the individual nodes located at the top level of all shards, or root
nodes. When TPS of the blockchain reaches 10,000, the network bandwidth throughput of a root
node exceeds 50Mbps. In order for the system to achieve 100,000 TPS, each root node has to
meet the bandwidth requirement of over 500Mbps, which could be tough to achieve in a purely
permissionless network, which any node can join and leave at any time.

As a strong advocate of distributed computing, we firmly believe that a real blockchain platform
must operate on the permissionless networks. We construct TOP Chain on a completely
permissionless network. By adopting layered network structure and two-layer sharding technique
on the consensus network, TOP Chain can achieve performance comparable to the permission-
based networks.

3.1.1 Layered Consensus Network

The consensus network of TOP Chain consists of three layers - Edge Network that provides access
points for clients, Routing Network that synchronizes transactions and states across zones and shards,
and Core Network that executes the actual consensus process for transactions.

17
TOP Decentralized Open Communication Network

Edge Network

Routing

Routing Network Transfer 7

Core Network

3.1.1.1 Edge Network

Edge Network, the only entrance for clients (apps or users) to access TOP Chain, consists of a collection
of Edge Nodes. Edge Nodes relay messages and transactions without performing any transaction
consensus. Edge Nodes don’t keep a complete ledger or generate any transaction. The primary purpose
of the Edge Network is to protect Routing Network and Core Network.

3.1.1.2 Routing Network

Routing Network, comprised of Advanced Nodes, routes transactions from the Edge Network to the Core
Network, where transactions are verified. Although it does not take part in the consensus process or
generate new transactions, the Routing Network adds an additional layer of transaction security by
auditing transactions confirmed by the Core. Advanced Nodes on the Routing Network also manage
shards and synchronize account state across the shards.

18
TOP Decentralized Open Communication Network

3.1.1.3 Core Network

Core Network, the consensus network of the TOP Chain, is divided into multiple zones and shards. The
whole TOP system is partitioned into several zones, and then each zone is dynamically divided into
multiple shards. Each shard validates and executes consensus on separate sets of transactions
concurrently. In this way, the two-layer sharding network can process large volumes of transactions as a
whole. Nodes on the Core Network, referred to as Core Nodes, are elected according to their stake on
TOP. Then, a certain number of Core Nodes are randomly selected by a verifiable random function (VRF)
algorithm to form the consensus overlay network in each shard. Those nodes on the consensus networks
are named as consensus nodes. For security reasons, the number of nodes in each shard should reach a
certain threshold, for instance, at least 21 consensus nodes and at least nine backup nodes. The
consensus nodes in a shard perform PBFT consensus algorithm on all transactions submitted to the
corresponding shard.

3.1.2 Core Objects
3.1.2.1. Account

A user account can be considered as an address on the chain. An account is a set of data object
containing state information and logic, including account balance (Balance), data properties (Property),
and Actions for each data property. The account balance can also be treated as a special data property.
An action could be a system-level function or a smart contract deployed by the account owner. The data
object and its processing logic in an account can be easily and flexibly extended with new properties and
customized actions.

3.1.2.2 Property

A property of an account is a user-defined data object, which is a key-value pair. The key is an arbitrary
string whose value can be any of the data types such as Integer, String, List, Hashmap and so on.
Account balance, a special property, exists when the account is generated.

3.1.2.3 Action

An action provides flexible logical processing capabilities for a property. An action can be a built-in
system function such as Hash and Vote, or a user-defined smart contract. Users can trigger an action by
sending a transaction or a message.

3.1.2.4 Message

A message is an instruction that initiates an action on a property of an account. Data attached to a
message contain property, action, input parameters and output parameters. For security purposes, a
message cannot alter the account balance.

19
TOP Decentralized Open Communication Network

A message is a special kind of transaction. An account sending high-frequency messages is subject to
flow control and has to pay gas fees, or the account owner may be forced to perform proof of work
(POW).

3.1.2.5 Transaction

A transaction refers to an instruction that initiates an asset transfer from one account to another. A
transaction can also contain an action that will be triggered when the transaction is being processed.

3.1.2.6 Unit Lattice

A transaction or a message may change the value of a certain property and consequently the state of the
account. Each transaction or message applied to an account is called a transaction record or a unit.
When TOP Chain stores the units of an account, each unit is linked to the previous unit. All the past
events on the account as well as the latest status of all its properties can be retrieved through the process
of navigating all the units of an account from the beginning unit (that is, the initial state of all properties
when the account is created) to the last unit. Essentially, all units of an account are linked to form a tiny
chain, named as a unit chain. The collection of unit chains of all accounts in a shard is called a unit lattice.

As the data structure of a unit chain shows, the last unit contains all the information that proves the
validity of the final state values of all properties in an account. As a result, the unit chain can be safely
pruned to keep only the last unit. TOP Chain can prune all unit chains in a shard in real time without
affecting the whole system, significantly reducing the footprint of the entire blockchain.

3.1.2.7 Block Lattice

On TOP Chain, each shard periodically packs the last units of all the updated accounts in the shard to
form blocks and then submits the blocks to the Routing Network. The set of all these blocks within a zone
is called a block lattice. The block is the basic data structure for cross-shard synchronization and block
lattice for cross-zone synchronization.

3.2 Consensus Mechanism

TOP Chain uses PBFT-DPoS (practical byzantine fault tolerance with delegated proof of stake)
consensus mechanism specially designed to support real businesses on the blockchain. In the traditional
DPoS consensus mechanism, consensus nodes are selected based solely on their stake, or the size of
their assets, leading to the the-rich-get-richer situation. The stake defined on TOP Chain, called
Comprehensive Stake, combines multiple factors including asset stake, accumulated reputation,
computing power and so on. TOP uses a VRF algorithm to elect the final consensus nodes among nodes
with the highest comprehensive stake. The consensus nodes execute PBFT algorithm to validate
transactions and produce blocks. The consensus mechanism protects the security and integrity of TOP
Chain.

21
TOP Decentralized Open Communication Network

3.2.1 Definition of Comprehensive Stake
The comprehensive stake defined by TOP includes the following four factors:
1) Computing Power of a Node

To join the consensus network in TOP, a node needs to meet the basic computing power
requirements. The proof of work (POW) algorithm adopted by TOP is a variant of the Scrypt, which
demands a node to have high throughput input/output (IO) and large memory. In addition, the PoW
algorithm is highly anti-ASIC.

2) Network Capability of a Node

The proof-of-bandwidth (PoB) consensus mechanism evaluates and measures the network capacity
of anode. The PoB algorithm first randomly picks a batch of evaluating nodes from the candidate
node pool and then instructs them to test the network bandwidth of the target nodes.

3) Asset Stake of a Node

The asset stake refers to the number of TOP Tokens locked up for a certain period the node holds in
its account. The tokens shall meet the minimum lock-up period requirement.

4) Reputation of aNode

The reputation of a node measures its accumulated contributions to the system since it joins the
network. More specifically, a node's reputation is the sum of the tokens that it has mined from the
ecosystem, an epitome of its work history in the network. If a node conducts malicious activities that
result in deposit forfeiture, its reputation will be negative.

3.2.2 Admission to Consensus Network

To become a consensus node, a node first needs to join the candidate node pool. To be admitted into the
candidate node pool, the node should meet specific requirements on its computing power, network
capacity, asset stake and work reputation. After staying in the pool for a certain period, the node may be
elected as a consensus node.

3.2.3 Sharding

When the consensus network is sharded, a VRF algorithm first generates a random seed for sharding
based on the historical information about the past shards, and then an improved FTS (follow-the-satoshi)
algorithm randomly selects nodes from the node pool to form shards. In general, nodes with higher
Comprehensive Stake are more likely to be selected to form shards.

3.2.4 Consensus

Within each shard, consensus nodes use a PBFT algorithm to execute the consensus process on
transactions. A transaction is confirmed after it obtains signatures from at least 2/3 of the consensus

22
TOP Decentralized Open Communication Network

nodes in a shard and gets approval from an advanced node on the Routing Network, which audits the
transaction submitted by the shard.

3.3 Cross-Shard & Cross-Zone Synchronization

TOP chain uses block lattices to perform transaction synchronization among shards inside a zone. Each
shard periodically packs into blocks the latest state information about all the changed accounts and
passes the blocks on to other shards in the same zone, keeping all shards in one zone synchronized in
terms of the account state.

TOP Chain performs cross-zone synchronization similarly. Each zone generates blocks containing the
latest state information on all the changed accounts and exchanges the blocks with other zones,
synchronizing account state across all zones.

3.4 Smart Contract

To ensure the smart contracts deployed on TOP Chain are flexible and secure, TOP offers two types of
smart contracts - Platform Contracts and Service Contracts, which operates on independent and isolated
virtual machines (VMs). More specifically, Platform contracts run on the Platform VM, while service
contracts run on the Service VM designed for the service chains. TOP Chain employs a special virtual
machine called Core VM to run built-in core functions that provide basic core functions such as Signature,
Vote, Lock, Deposit, Transfer and more. These core functions are Turing complete and therefore very
powerful and flexible.

3.4.1 Platform Contract

A platform contract is deployed on the main chain to manage assets. Platform contracts are written in a
Stack-based, non-Turing complete scripting language to ensure security and enforceability. However,
platform contracts are allowed to call powerful core functions in Core VM. As a result, even though
platform contracts are based on non-Turing complete language, they can still implement flexible functions
with the help of the core functions in Core VM.

3.4.2 Service Contract

A service contract is a smart contract deployed on a service chain to perform specific business logic.
Service contracts can be written in Turing complete languages and thus can realize complex, flexible
business logic. For security reasons, service contracts cannot directly change the financial assets in
accounts. The virtual machine to execute service contracts is implemented in WebAssembly (WASM) and
it supports various high-level languages including C, C++, JAVA, and JavaScript. Additionally, the virtual
machine for service contracts provides features for efficient development, debugging and operation.

3.5 Layered Ledgers

Transactions are processed in three separate layers of distributed ledgers so that a massive number of
transactions generated from the communication services can be settled on TOP Network. The diagram
below shows how the transactions of a VPN Session are processed:

Service Logs

A service log contains detailed records of the services a business has used and could involve any set
of business data that a distributed ledger needs to store. For example, when user A sends 10
messages to user B, 10 separate records are generated in the service log for user A, each containing
details of one message. The service log could be gigantic when the volume of a service business is
huge, especially for service businesses that provide services such as messaging, VPN (billed based
on 512KB data blocks) and phone calls. The service log must be retained for billing and clearance
purposes, but writing the entire log into the blockchain is unnecessary and impractical due to the log’s
size and volume. Instead, service logs are generated by an off-chain processor and written into a
decentralized storage provided by the TOP Storage subsystem. Validators randomly select and verify
service logs on a regular basis to ensure the data in the logs are intact and accurate.

The service log can be permanently saved in the TOP Storage. The owners of the service logs,
typically Dapps, need to pay TOP Tokens to the nodes offering storage services. When the service
log is no longer needed, a Dapp can request TOP to delete it.

Service Transactions

A service transaction is a billing record submitted to the blockchain for the purpose of business
settlement. To reduce the number of transactions the blockchain needs to process, an off-chain
processor can merge multiple service records containing identical billing information into a single
service transaction. For example, when user A sends 100 messages to user B, these messages are
aggregated into a single service transaction that requests settlement for all the messages in one

24
TOP Decentralized Open Communication Network

transaction. Although a service transaction does not include detailed information on each service
record, it does contain index information that can locate the corresponding service log.

Service transactions of a specific type of service are written into the service chain corresponding to
the service type. For instance, the service transactions created by VPN will be written into the Proxy
Service Chain.

3) Service Payments

A service payment is a financial transaction that requests settlement of payment after the completion
of a service session. Service payments are processed on the main chain.

3.6 Consensus Mechanisms of Service Chains

TOP Chain is designed to support multiple consensus mechanisms as different types of business have
different logic and workflows. TOP Chain allows each service chain to adopt its unique consensus
mechanism to meet its business processing needs.

1) RCS Service Chain uses Proof-of-Delivery to reach consensus on message delivery.

2) Proxy Service Chain uses Proof-of-Bandwidth to reach consensus on network bandwidth consumed
by users.

3) VoIP Service Chain uses Proof-of-Calltime to reach consensus on call duration.

4) Storage Service Chain uses Proof-of-Storage to reach consensus on storage space and time.

5) CDN Service Chain uses Proof-of-Bandwidth to reach consensus on bandwidth consumption.

3.7 Security
3.7.1. Transaction Flooding & DDoS

In DDoS attacks, attackers may send a large number of transactions from accounts under their control to
flood the whole system and thwart legitimate transaction processing. Such attacks seem possible as TOP
Chain does not charge fees for general transactions, making it costless for attackers to submit a large
number of transactions. TOP Chain has implemented several anti-attack strategies. It can be very
expensive for an attacker to launch attacks by sending high volumes of transactions.

3.7.1.1 Fees for High-value or High-frequency Transactions

TOP Chain does not charge fees for general transactions but requires payments for high-frequency or
high-value transactions. A transaction is considered as high-value if its value exceeds the limit
determined by the on-chain governance mechanism. TOP Chain may reject high-frequency transactions
without gas fees according to its flow control policy.

25
TOP Decentralized Open Communication Network

3.7.1.2 Minimum Deposit

An account must hold a minimum number of TOP tokens before it is allowed to create and submit a
transaction to TOP Chain. This requirement significantly increases the cost for an attacker to generate a
large number of accounts and subsequently send a large volume of transactions in order to launch an
attack.

3.7.1.3 Flow Control on Transactions
1) Minimum Transaction Interval

The minimum interval between two consecutive transactions under the same account, denoted as Wt,
increases as the transaction frequency (Sx) increases. The waiting time between the first transaction and
the second is denoted as W1 ms. The interval between the second and the third, denoted as W2, is W1 *
(N+1)/N + Rand(x), and so on. Edge nodes reject high-frequency transactions submitted from accounts
without a gas fee.

2) PoW Requirement

Real users can increase transaction frequency by providing the proof of work (PoW) in each transaction
they submit. The PoW is the Hash Puzzle calculated based on the information on the header of the last
transaction. If each transaction contains PoW, the account can generate transactions at a fixed interval
determined by the consensus of on-chain governance.

3.7.1.4 Additional Flow Control

If an attacker somehow bypasses the flow control imposed by the Edge Network, some high-frequency
transactions may get into the consensus network. The consensus nodes use information in the unit lattice
to calculate the frequency of transactions initiated by a sender. When the transaction frequency exceeds
the allowed threshold, the transactions in question will be rejected.

3.7.1.5 Locked Asset

The new asset received from a transaction will be locked for a certain period, during which the asset
cannot be transferred. The lock-up period, a parameter set by the system, depends on the value of the
asset. Assets with higher value have longer lock-up time, which prevents circular transfer attacks and
protects the safety of high-value transactions.

3.7.2 Sybil Attack

In Sybil attacks, attackers attempt to create or control hundreds or thousands of nodes to sabotage the
security of the consensus network. The following measures can prevent Sybil attacks.

26
TOP Decentralized Open Communication Network

3.7.2.1 Minimum Deposit Requirement

Each node needs to have an independent account and make a minimum deposit in the account before
joining the consensus network. Minimum deposit requirements are different for edge nodes, core nodes
and advanced nodes. The more important the role of a node, the higher the minimum deposit the node
has to put down. As a result, it is costly for an attacker to create and own many nodes to launch an
attack.

3.7.2.2 Admission Requirement and Random Sharding

A node needs to pass a capacity test using the Proof-of-Capacity algorithm before joining the network. A
node should meet specific requirements on network bandwidth and CPU power if it intends to become a
candidate node for the consensus network. The DPoS algorithm, based on the comprehensive stake,
requires an attacker to accumulate a large sum of assets and stay in the system for a long period before
launching an attack. These methods significantly increase the cost of an attack. Moreover, TOP Chain
uses VRF to randomly select nodes to form a shard from the candidate node pool, reducing the
probability of malicious collusion among nodes.

3.7.3. Penny-Spend Attack

In penny-spend attacks, attackers send an enormous number of low-value transactions to a large number
of accounts, preventing the system from processing legitimate transactions and wasting storage space in

consensus nodes. The restrictions on high-frequency transactions and the minimum deposit requirement

mentioned above can prevent most penny-spend attacks.

In addition, transactions are stored in the unit lattices, where old transaction data in accounts can be
pruned in real time as the system processes new transactions, significantly reducing the storage space
for accounts and making it unlikely for penny-spend attacks to exhaust the storage space in nodes.

3.7.4 Attack on Single Shard

In attacks targeting at single shard, attackers try to locate a shard in which a specific transaction occurs
and then attempt to launch DDoS attacks on the shard, modify transactions or create fake transactions.
TOP Chain prevents such attacks with the following measures:

3.7.4.1 Edge Network

The Edge Network separates users and clients from the Core Network so that they can not directly
connect to the Core Network to retrieve account and transaction information on consensus nodes.

27
TOP Decentralized Open Communication Network

3.7.4.2 Random Sharding

The VRF algorithm randomly and dynamically selects consensus nodes to form shards. Shards
dynamically rotate to serve different sets of account spaces. When validating transactions, each shard
dynamically selects its PBFT leader. Such three-layer dynamic randomness makes it difficult for attackers
to identify in advance the specific shard and node processing a specific transaction, minimizing the
chance of malicious nodes colluding in advance and launching DDoS attacks on a specific node.

3.7.4.3 Double Auditing

In order for a transaction to be confirmed, the transaction is first validated in a shard through the
consensus (i.e., PBFT) mechanism, and then it will be further audited and signed by an advanced node in
the Routing Network. An advanced node is selected dynamically at the transaction level, so, the attacker
cannot anticipate which node will be responsible for auditing the transaction. In this way, malicious nodes
in a shard, if any, cannot deceive the system into accepting fake transactions.

3.7.4.4 Shard Merge

When a shard suffers a DDoS attack, its surviving nodes are so few that the shard cannot work securely.
The attacked shard will automatically be merged into another shard to form a larger shard.

3.7.5 Double-Spend Attack

TOP Chain organizes transactions into the unit lattices, where transactions initiated by an account are
stored on a chain dedicated to the account. Therefore, transactions of an account will form its own micro
chain. Each valid transaction of an account contains a unique nonce that monotonically increases as well
as the hash value of the previous transaction that the system has confirmed. In addition, when a
transaction is verified, the account balance is updated in real time, allowing each consensus node to
discover and reject double-spend transactions immediately.

3.7.6 Smart Contract & EVM

TOP Chain offers two types of smart contracts, namely Platform Contract and Service Contract, which are
executed on independent and isolated virtual machines. Platform contracts, written in non-Turing
complete scripting languages, handle account assets on the main chain. In comparison, service contracts
are written in Turing complete languages and thus very flexible. However, service contracts are restricted
to running on the independent service chains, which protects the main chain from asset losses caused by
the loopholes in service contracts.

3.7.7 Single Node Attack

In single node attacks, malicious nodes tamper with transactions or refuse to process transactions.
However, even if one-third of the consensus nodes in a shard are malicious, the PBFT consensus

28
TOP Decentralized Open Communication Network

algorithm can still guarantee that the remaining honest nodes execute the consensus process for
transactions. Nodes that fail to process transactions in time are replaced by backup nodes. After the
consensus nodes verify a transaction, the transaction needs to be audited and signed by an advanced
node before getting the final confirmation, which allows advanced nodes to discover malicious nodes ina
shard. The system selects advanced nodes randomly at the transaction level, making it impossible for
consensus nodes to identify in advance the audit-conducting advanced node and preventing malicious
collusion between advanced nodes and consensus nodes.

3.7.8 Replay Transaction Attack

In a replay transaction attack, an attacker intercepts transaction packets on the transport layer in the
operating system and saves the transactions for replay later. This attack is a variant of DDoS and double-
spend attacks.

TOP Chain prevents replay transaction attacks with the following strategies.

1) Each account has a monotonically incremental nonce to identify every transaction. Transactions with
the same nounce initiated by one account will be rejected.

2) Each submitted transaction needs to contain the hash value of the latest valid transaction in the
account. All transactions in the same account are organized into a unit lattice in chronological order of
creation, which allows consensus nodes to determine easily whether an incoming transaction is a
duplicate.

TOP Decentralized Open Communication Network

4.1 TOP Communication Services

TOP Network offers an array of network communication and telecommunication services, which can
support any functions that a communication application requires.

4.1.1 TOP RCS Service
TOP RCS (Rich Communication Service) offers the following services:
e One-to-one Chat
e Group Chat
e Internet Call
e Video Call
e Walkie Talkie
e Content Sharing
e File Transfer
e Presence

e Others

Developers can easily utilize TOP RCS to build a powerful messaging app similar to WeChat or
WhatsApp. Since TOP RCS is based on the international standard protocol, all communication apps
using TOP RCS are interoperable. On the contrary, WeChat, WhatsApp and Telegram cannot interact
with each other as they are confined to their own private, incompatible protocols.

TOP RCS implements end-to-end encryption with Double Ratchet algorithm. TOP uses X3DH algorithm
to safely manage and exchange secret keys and encrypt data with AES 256 algorithm. Messaging apps
supported by TOP RCS are highly secured and able to protect user privacy. No centralized third party can
censor content or block users on TOP Network.

TOP RCS Service adopts Proof-of-Delivery consensus algorithm to verify the workload of nodes that
provide messaging services and uses Proof-of-Calltime consensus mechanism regarding the calling
service.

4.1.2 TOP Proxy Service

TOP Proxy Service provides a proxy overlay network for users to connect to the Internet, which is also
known as Virtual Private Network (VPN) service. The proxy overlay network on TOP Network consists of
a proxy server group and a relay server group. An individual server can act as both a proxy and a relay
server. Below is the process of users accessing the Internet with TOP Proxy Service:

A user requests VPN service from TOP.

TOP Proxy Service randomly selects three relay servers and one proxy server.

The user connects to one of the relay servers, which is further connected to the proxy server
through the other two relay servers.

The proxy server is connected to the Internet.

TOP Proxy Service protects users' online security and anonymity and offers strong anti-blocking
capability by adopting a series of techniques listed below.

The selection of three relay servers and one proxy server for each session is random.

Each server knows only the next server it is connected to instead of the entire transmission path.
Data is encrypted by each server and decrypted only by the next server.

Data is obfuscated by the client SDK and each relay server so that attackers cannot identify
traffic patterns.

Traffic is split and passed on to the two intermediary relay servers so that neither of them has
access to the entire traffic.

TOP Proxy Service utilizes Proof-of-Bandwidth (PoB) consensus mechanism to verify the workload of
each relay server and proxy server.

4.1.3 TOP Streaming Service

TOP Steaming Service offers streaming media service and live streaming service. A P2P content
distribution network (CDN) is built within TOP Network, via which TOP Network delivers videos to the
audience. The CDN service developed by TOP costs much less compared with conventional CDN
services, reducing bandwidth expenses significantly for developers.

TOP Streaming Service supports standard HLS and HTTPS protocols. It is very easy and simple for apps
to access TOP Streaming Service.

TOP Decentralized Open Communication Network

TOP Streaming Service adopts Poof-of-Bandwidth (PoB) consensus mechanism to verify the workload of
each streaming server.

4.1.4 TOP loT Service

TOP loT Service provides standard communication protocols for loT devices to interconnect and interact
with each other. TOP loT also offers SDK for loT devices to convert their private protocols to standard
protocols. TOP Network provides a secure public infrastructure network for a massive number of loT
devices to exchange and store data.

TOP, an ecosystem of loT, supports a variety of loT device-related services including registration,
discovery, remote call, settlement and payment.

4.1.5 TOP VoIP Service

TOP VoIP Service provides PSTN telephony service, which enables users to make calls over the Internet
to cell phones and landline phones. For VoIP calls, voice signals are carried on the Internet before
reaching the PSTN network, allowing VoIP call providers to offer lower rates compared to traditional
phone calls. The rate gap between VoIP calls and traditional calls is especially huge for International
calls.

TOP Network is an open communication network and it is entirely permissionless. Any voice termination
providers from small voice aggregators to large carriers can join TOP Network to become a voice service
provider. Without middlemen taking a share of on the service fees, TOP VoIP Service offers much lower
price and better voice quality.

Apps connect to TOP VoIP Service with TOP SDK, which encapsulates Audio Encoding/Decoding, QoS,
protocol implementation, etc.

TOP VoIP Service adopts Proof-of-Calltime consensus mechanism to verify the workload of VoIP service
providers.

TOP Decentralized Open Communication Network

4.2 TOP Storage Service

TOP Storage Service offers decentralized file-based storage service on TOP Network. It can be
considered as the decentralized version of Amazon AWS S3. A file to be stored on TOP Network is
segmented and encrypted, and each segment is stored in multiple nodes to ensure data security and
reliability. Devices such as servers and computers with spare storage and bandwidth can join TOP
Network as nodes to provide storage service and receive rewards in TOP token.

Based on TOP Storage Service, TOP UGC Service helps app developers manage user-generated
content (UGC) such as photos and videos. UGC management is an essential function of most social
apps. TOP RCS Service also employs TOP UGC Service to handle photos and videos shared by users.

TOP Storage Service uses Proof-of-Storage consensus mechanism to ensure that files are stably stored
in the system.

4.3 TOP DNS Service

TOP DNS Service provides a naming system for objects in TOP ecosystem. Human-readable names are
assigned to nodes, accounts, smart contracts and Dapps without involving any centralized organization.
Each end user has a unique name just like Email address or phone number. Objects are identified and
found by their names instead of account addresses, which allows them to make payments more
conveniently.

4.4 TOP Billing Service

As mentioned before, business data are processed, booked and settled in three-layered ledgers.
Payments are settled on the main chain. Multiple service transactions can be aggregated and written ona
service chain in the form of a single record. Service logs generated by the off-chain processors are stored
in the Service Log Storage, a decentralized database powered by TOP Storage Service.

TOP Billing Service enables Dapps to generate detailed billing information such as invoices. To construct
a billing statement, TOP Billing Service first locates the aggregated service transaction record ona
service chain, and then retrieves from Service Log Storage database the specific service log that
corresponds to the index in the aggregated record.

Service fees on TOP Network are paid by Dapps to nodes. When a user requests a VPN session, it is the
VPN app rather than the user who pays the service fee to proxy servers. Currently, TOP Billing Service
does not support Dapps to charge end users, but Dapps can use smart contracts to charge end users
based on the billing information generated by TOP Billing Service.

TOP Decentralized Open Communication Network

5. TOP Marketplace

Cloud communication services on TOP Network are provided by various service providers, who tend to
charge different prices. Apps, clients of these service providers, tend to have different requirements
regarding the scope and price of services. TOP Marketplace, a decentralized, open marketplace, allows
service providers to announce service information and apps to submit requirements. TOP automatically
matches offers and bids to reach a deal between service providers and apps. The system creates
contracts for paired parties and monitors contract execution.

As a decentralized open market, TOP Marketplace ensures the scope, quality and price of services
offered by any provider are transparent and consistent for each client.

5.1 Marketplace Smart Contract

TOP Marketplace is implemented in a smart contract that lists services, matches ask prices and bids, lock
deals and settle payments.
1) The service provider sends an offer to TOP Marketplace with ask price, the scope of service and
other information. The offer also includes the amount of deposit the provider is willing to pay. The
deposit is frozen once TOP Marketplace accepts the offer.

35
TOP Decentralized Open Communication Network

2) When a Dapp requests a service, the smart contract automatically finds the most suitable
provider for the service and locks the deal.

3) A Dapp pays a fee for submitting a request to TOP Marketplace. The tokens, which Dapps use to
pay the fee, will be burned. This method prevents the marketplace from being attacked by DDoS
and indirectly encourages Dapps to use long-term contracts.

4) When a provider refuses to provide service after a deal is locked, the system confiscates its
deposit and voids the tokens.

5.2 Market Order Matching Consensus

For each service session, the smart contract that realizes TOP Marketplace creates a list of candidate
service providers according to the service scope and bid price required by a Dapp. The system then
generates from the candidate list three separate sub-lists sorted respectively by the amount of deposit,
the length of service history and credit score. The system randomly picks up the final service provider
among the top candidates on the three sub-lists.

5.2.1 Proof-of-Deposit

Service providers offering larger deposit rank higher on the candidate sub-list.

5.2.2 Proof-of-Service-Time

Service providers with higher credit scores rank higher on the candidate sub-list.

5.2.3 Proof-of-Credit-Score
Service providers with longer service history rank higher on the candidate sub-list.
The final selection algorithm could be described as:

random(topN1(time_list) + topN2(deposit_list) + topN3(credit_list))

In the algorithm, N3 > 2* N2 > 4* N1, which means credit score has the greatest weight, followed by the
deposit.

In short, the final service providers are selected randomly among candidates that have the highest credit
score, the largest deposit and the longest service history.

5.3 Consensus of Market Access

To guarantee security and service quality on the network, TOP Marketplace sets up conditions of market
access for service providers. A service provider entering the marketplace has to ensure its nodes meet
the following standards.

36
TOP Decentralized Open Communication Network

5.3.1. Proof-of-CPU

The nodes of a service provider joining TOP Network must meet specific requirements regarding their
hash power.

5.3.2 Proof-of-Service

Service providers joining TOP Network have to ensure their nodes meet specific service quality criteria.
For example, a proxy node needs to prove it has sufficient network bandwidth capability. TOP Network
constantly monitors the service quality of each node.

5.3.3 Proof-of-Deposit

When a service provider sends an offer to the marketplace, a certain amount of tokens in the provider's
account will be frozen as the deposit.

5.3.4 Proof-of-Certification

Some communication services provided by TOP are telecom services, such as VoIP calls to PSTN
network. A node providing telecom services must present a Class 2 Certificate. TOP system randomly
selects a few other nodes to verify the certificate held by the node.

5.4 Market Stability
5.4.1. Market Credit Score

TOP Marketplace adopts a decentralized credit rating system to encourage service providers to offer
high-quality services. The credit score of a service provider is calculated based on the number of disputed
transactions submitted by Dapps. Service providers with higher credit scores have higher chance to be
selected.

5.4.2 Price Stability

TOP Marketplace adopts a decentralized credit rating system to encourage service providers to offer
high-quality services. A service provider's credit score is determined by the number of disputed
transactions submitted by Dapps. Service providers with higher credit scores have more chances to be
selected in the marketplace.

37
TOP Decentralized Open Communication Network

6. Apps

TOP Network is specially built for communication and social apps. It provides API and SDK for
developers to quickly build and deploy their communication apps. With tools offered by TOP, even a small
team can easily develop a full-featured messaging app similar to WhatsApp. Developers do not have to
worry about the scalability and stability of the communication network when their apps attract millions of
users, because TOP Network takes care of those issues for all apps, generating huge cost savings
compared with in-house solutions. Developers can thus dedicate their resources to their businesses and
leave technology development and network operations to TOP.

6.1 Dapps and Typical Cases

Developers can quickly build rich communication applications or integrate communication and social
functions into existing apps utilizing the cloud communication services provided by TOP Network. The
typical products and use cases listed below are just the tip of the iceberg.

| fovea

STREAM

6.1.1 Messaging Apps

Messaging, the core function of all social and communication apps, is widely used for person-to-person,
man-to-machine and machine-to-machine communication. TOP RCS Service supports functions including
one-to-one message, large group message, message receipt, picture message, voice and video
message, file transfer, Walkie Talkie, voice call and video call.

With TOP RCS Service, developers can quickly build full-featured messaging apps similar to WhatsApp
or add messaging features to the existing apps.

6.1.2 VoIP Phone Call

In a VoIP call, voice signals are transmitted over the Internet before reaching local telecom operators, a
method that generates much lower costs compared with the traditional PSTN call. The rate gap between
VoIP calls and traditional calls is huge, especially when it comes to international calls. Boosted by the
wide adoption of broadband Internet, VoIP call businesses have been growing rapidly. The global VoIP
market is expected to reach $140 billion by 2021 ‘fe!4).

38
TOP Decentralized Open Communication Network

Traditionally, developers need to sign bilateral agreements with telecom operators or voice gateway
providers to offer VoIP service. Furthermore, for global service coverage, developers usually have to work
with multiple telecom operators at the same time. Small developers often find it challenging to establish
business relationships with telecom operators due to the high barriers to entry.

With a decentralized consensus mechanism to verify service providers’ workload and a decentralized
marketplace to facilitate deals, TOP VoIP Service creates a transparent platform that all telecom
operators and voice gateway providers around the world can join in to serve customers. TOP offers much
wider coverage than any single telecom operator. In addition, TOP VoIP Service does not take a share of
service providers’ profits like a middleman and therefore can offer much lower rates compared with other
networks.

6.1.3 VPN Service

VPN is the most secure and effective tool to access the Internet without compromising user privacy. The
fast-growing global VPN market is estimated to reach $106 billion by 2022 (8212),

TOP Proxy is a decentralized network of proxy servers without any individual or organization controlling
the system. Powered by advanced technologies such as random selection of proxy servers, random
network routing, traffic obfuscation and data packet encryption, TOP Proxy Service ensures anonymous,
secure Internet connection and prevents firewalls from blocking the VPN service.

Developers can utilize TOP Proxy Service SDK to build their VPN apps quickly to serve end users.

6.1.4 Live Streaming

TOP Streaming Service is designed for developers to build live streaming apps. It addresses the two
biggest headaches in the live streaming app development:

e Technical hurdles: developers need to have an advanced technical background to build a live
streaming app that provides low-latency, high-definition audio and video. TOP Streaming SDK offers
a full-stack solution that supports audio/video encoding/decoding, transcoding, filtering, and network
transmission.

e Bandwidth costs: the bandwidth cost for a live streaming app increases significantly as the app’s user
base grows. TOP Network can bring considerable savings to developers with a decentralized CDN
service powered by TOP Streaming Service, which is much cheaper than the traditional CDN.

6.1.5 Social Apps

For social networking apps, TOP Network can provide various decentralized services such as data
storage, UGC management, ID management and communication. TOP allows social apps to issue their
unique tokens to build their token economies.

39
TOP Decentralized Open Communication Network

6.2 Decentralized or Partially-Centralized Apps

The decentralized TOP Network provides all the core capabilities required for communication and social
apps and allows apps to utilize smart contracts to implement additional business logic, enabling
developers to build completely decentralized apps on the TOP platform. TOP stores app data such as
user information securely on the blockchain and uses end-to-end encryption technology to protect
communication content, making it difficult for any individual or organization to block users, censor content
or steal user data. A completely decentralized app on TOP is free from security breaches plaguing

centralized apps.

Decentralized
App

Developers can choose to use centralized systems along with TOP Network. For example, an app may
use a centralized database to manage users and utilize TOP Network for communication and storage
solutions. Such an app is semi-decentralized. As an open network, TOP Network provides open protocols
and API for developers to integrate TOP seamless with centralized infrastructure.

6.3 TOP API & SDK

The APIs and SDK kits provided by TOP enable developers to implement various communication apps
quickly.

e TOP API is a simple set of HTTPS Restful APIs and therefore suitable for Web apps.

e TOP SDK provides interfaces for native operating systems - Android, iOS, Mac, Windows and
Linux. TOP SDK also provides Media Engines for audio and video encoding/decoding, pre-
processing, post-processing and so on. The source code of TOP SDK is open to the community
and maintained by the community.

6.4 App: Dingtone, CoverMe, SkyVPN, TOP Messenger

Over the past several years, the TOP founding team has successfully developed multiple communication
apps including Dingtone, CoverMe and SkyVPN, which have performed excellently in their respective
markets. These apps are semi-decentralized: they share the same underlying communication network
layer that has a distributed architecture, while they have separate user databases and billing systems.
These apps will be moved to the TOP platform upon the roll-out of TOP and become the first Dapps on
TOP. Part of the source code for these products will be open to the TOP community to help developers
build high-quality decentralized communication apps.

Dingtone CoverMe SkyVPN

6.4.1 Dingtone

Dingtone is a market-leading VoIP app that provides a variety of rich communication functions including
VoIP calling, international SMS, cloud phone number, messaging, groups, fax, teleconferencing and
more. Its 38 million global users, over 30% of whom are in the United States, generate 1 billion minutes of
calling annually. Dingtone has signed bilateral agreements with major telecom operators worldwide,
including Tata, BICS, KPN/iBasis and IDT, so that Dingtone phone calls can reach any country or region
across the globe.

Upon being moved to the TOP platform, Dingtone can bring huge volumes of business quickly to the TOP
ecosystem. Dingtone will also fully benefit from the scale of TOP Network and further reduce its
infrastructure cost.

Dingtone plans to implement a built-in TOP light wallet so that Dingtone users can directly own TOP
Tokens. Dingtone has pioneered the business model that allows users to earn points by watching ads
and use points to pay for VoIP calls later. Dingtone plans to replace Dingtone point with TOP Token, a
strategy expected to bring considerable liquidity to the ecosystem. TOP Token can also increase the user
retention rate on Dingtone, as users can unlock premium features or enjoy special rates on Dingtone by
holding a certain number of TOP Tokens in the light wallet.

6.4.2 CoverMe

CoverMe is the first secure messaging app that has implemented end-to-end encryption technology,
which Telegram and WhatsApp later adopted. CoverMe offers other powerful security features such as
encrypted phone calls, self-destructed messaging, secure vault, decoy password and more. The app has
attracted over 5 million high-end users, mostly iOS users in the United States, who take data security and
privacy seriously.

42
TOP Decentralized Open Communication Network

After being moved to the TOP platform, CoverMe will become a thoroughly decentralized and serverless
app that supports secure, end-to-end encrypted messaging.

6.4.3 SkyVPN

Since its launch in 2017, SkyVPN has quickly become a rising star in the VPN market thanks to its fast
connection speed and its excellent anti-blocking ability enabled by advanced technologies such as anti-
DPI (Deep Packet Inspection), traffic obfuscation and shadow protocol tunnel. SkyVPN has hit 18 million
users and is expanding its user base rapidly.

6.4.4 TOP Messenger

TOP Decentralized Open Communication Network

Built entirely on TOP Network, TOP Messenger provides all the functions and features of WeChat,
WhatsApp and Skype with a higher level of security and user privacy protection. TOP Messenger can
interconnect with any other communication app that adopts the RCS protocol. An open-source, non-profit
project developed by the community without the control of any organization, TOP Messenger creates a
safe space clear of censorship where every user speaks freely. In comparison, messaging apps including
WeChat, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, all controlled by Internet giants, confine users to their
walled gardens, commercialize users as products, and have considerable power to block, censor and

filter any content or user.

7. TOP Ecosystem

The fundamental goal of TOP Network is to build a public network infrastructure that brings practical
value to the society. Using TOP as the underlying infrastructure, developers can build rich communication
and social networking apps easily to serve massive users. TOP Token, the native token on TOP Network,
brings all participants in TOP together form an ecosystem. All the communication services provided by
TOP have huge market size and are expected to generate massive volumes of business and transactions
in the ecosystem, thus bringing TOP to its prosperity.

7.1 Ecosystem Participants

Cross
Chain
Services

Service
Miners Miners

7.1.1 Ledger Miners

Ledger miners on TOP Chain verify transactions, maintain ledgers and execute smart contracts. Ledger
miners mine TOP Tokens by verifying transactions with the PBFT-DPoS consensus algorithm.

TOP is a permissionless public blockchain platform, where miners can contribute nodes to the consensus
network freely.

45
TOP Decentralized Open Communication Network

7.1.2 Service Miners

A service miner is a service provider that contributes nodes to TOP Network to offer various
communication services. For instance, if a data center operator attempts to provide proxy services by
connecting its 10 servers to TOP Network, this data center operator becomes a service miner. By
providing communication services, a service miner earns service fees in the form of TOP Tokens.
Assuming that the price for VPN traffic is 1 TOP Token per 1GB data, a VPN user who consumes 1GB
data traffic needs to pay 1 token. If this 1GB traffic flows through three relay servers and one proxy
server, these four nodes will share the 1 token reward at the end of the VPN session.

A node can be a service miner and ledger miner at the same time. This dual-role miner can mine tokens
by both verifying transactions and providing communications services.

7.1.3 Developers and Apps

The ultimate value of the TOP ecosystem is essentially determined by the number and quality of apps
built by developers. High-quality apps with large numbers of users can generate huge volumes of
transactions. App developers or end users pay for the communication services they consume. As the
service usage grows, service miners earn more service fees and more service miners join the TOP
ecosystem.

Dingtone, CoverMe and SkyVPN, apps developed by the TOP founding team prior to this project, will be
the first apps to run on TOP. With over 50 million existing users, they can immediately bring colossal
volumes of business to the TOP ecosystem upon their migration to TOP.

7.1.4 End Users

The end users of Dapps is the ultimate source of business growth in the TOP ecosystem. By using
functions in the Dapps, end users directly or indirectly generate transactions on TOP.

However, in most cases, it is the Dapp developers instead of the end users who pay service miners for
communication services. For example, a messaging app built on TOP does not charge end users, but the
app developer needs to pay fees to nodes that provide messaging services. End users typically make
payments to the developers.

As mentioned above, end users contribute to the ecosystem by using Dapps, so Dapps may incentivize
end users with token rewards based on their Dapp usage. For instance, when a messaging app user on
TOP creates a group chat with 500 other users, this user receives one TOP Token for every 100 hours of
total usage generated in this group chat.

46
TOP Decentralized Open Communication Network

7.1.5 Cross - Chain Services

One of TOP’s design goals is to offer a public communication network infrastructure. As an utterly open
network, TOP is open not only to Dapps but also to other blockchain platforms. TOP provides cross-chain
bridges for other blockchain platforms to access the decentralized cloud communication services on TOP.

7.2 Build The Ecosystem

TOP, a decentralized blockchain-based communication network infrastructure, carries real business
services rather than aims solely at digital currencies. The prosperity of the TOP ecosystem relies heavily
on the sufficient business volumes that the Dapps on TOP can generate and sustain.

7.2.1. Port Dingtone, CoverMe and SkyVPN to TOP

Dingtone, CoverMe and SkyVPN, created by the founding team of TOP, are expected to be ported to
TOP simultaneously during the development of TOP. Upon the launch of TOP, these apps can bring
massive volumes of business to TOP immediately:

e TOP VoIP Service will carry one billion-minute voice calls generated on Dingtone annually,
bringing vast volumes of business to service miners. Service fees will be paid in TOP Tokens
instead of fiat currency. Dingtone is also a social messaging app delivering billions of messages
monthly. Photos and videos shared by Dingtone users will be saved in TOP Storage, bringing
considerable business volume for storage service miners.

e CoverMe users are motivated to pay for the premium service with TOP Tokens because
cryptocurrency payment can enhance anonymity significantly. With 4 million high-end users,
CoverMe can generate large numbers of token holders. Private vault, a function commonly used
by CoverMe users, saves private photos, videos and files securely. Once CoverMe is ported to
the TOP platform, the private vault will be realized with TOP Storage, creating huge demand for
storage service.

e SkyVPN, having attracted over 10 million users, generates over 300TB VPN traffic daily. Once
SkyVPN is ported to TOP, VPN traffic will be transmitted through TOP Proxy Service, creating
huge volumes of business for the proxy service miners.

Along with the migration of Dingtone, CoverMe and SkyVPN to TOP, their current business partners will
join the TOP platform, bringing many heavyweight partners (i.e., service miners) to the TOP ecosystem
immediately:

e The servers that Dingtone deploys on 18 Internet backbone networks across the globe will
become service miners (or nodes) on TOP Network.

e Dingtone's global telecom partners, such as Tata, KPN/iBasis, IDT and BICS, will connect to TOP
Network as VoIP service providers.

e Data center partners of SkyVPN worldwide will join TOP to provide proxy service.

47
TOP Decentralized Open Communication Network

7.2.2 Developer Incentive Program

The TOP ecosystem can continue to flourish only if developers port to or build on TOP a large number of
high-quality apps. In TOP's token distribution program, a certain number of tokens are allocated to reward
early developers. Telos Foundation plans to reward developers with tokens as initial incentives for joining
the TOP ecosystem. Meanwhile, the foundation plans to subsidize service fees paid by developers. All
the incentive tokens are locked in a smart contract and intended for service fee payment only.

7.2.3 User Incentive Program

Users are the ultimate consumers of various services in the TOP ecosystem. TOP cannot generate
constant business without the end consumers’ continuous app usage. Users in the TOP ecosystem
belong to Dapps, so only app developers can decide how to reward their users. Here is a typical user
reward case among an array of incentive mechanisms:

1) An app developer issues a new token on the TOP platform (supposing it’s called App Token).

2) The app rewards users based on their app usage. For example, a user gets one App Token after
using the app for a certain period.

3) By holding a certain amount of App Tokens, users can unlock certain premium features in the
app.

Dingtone and SkyVPN, as the very first Dapps onTOP, will implement user incentive plans. For example,
Dingtone's users will be incentivized in the following ways:

1) Auser will be rewarded with TOP Tokens for inviting friends to join Dingtone, who generates
continuous usage within Dingtone.

2) Avuser will get reward tokens for creating a large group chat which generates a certain amount of
usage.

7.2.4 Service Miner Incentive Plan

Unlike miners on Bitcoin and Ethereum, TOP's service miners cannot mine tokens by calculating hash
functions but need to provide communication services to earn service fees. Dapps rely on service miners
to realize high-quality functions. TOP Network cannot offer high-quality service without a sufficient
number of service miners.

Besides communication service fees, service miners can get additional incentives. In TOP Token
distribution plan, some tokens are reserved as extra incentives for service miners.

Service miners get extra incentives in the following three ways:

48
1)

2)

3)

TOP Decentralized Open Communication Network

Initial Incentive for Miners to Join the Ecosystem

In the early-stage development of the TOP ecosystem, Telos Foundation will reward service miners
with a certain amount of tokens when they join TOP. These tokens are locked in a smart contract until
the miners have earned a certain amount of service fees and provided sufficient services for over 12
months.

Bonus Service Fees

In the early-stage development of the TOP ecosystem, Telos Foundation will give bonus service fee
to a service miner when the volume of its accumulated service hits a certain threshold. Miners can
use bonus tokens only as deposits but cannot withdraw them.

Incentive for Advanced Service Nodes

Advanced service nodes play a much bigger role than normal service nodes on TOP Network.
Advanced service nodes also provide many services, such as offline message storage service,
without charging fees. TOP issues additional 0.7%-1% of tokens per year to reward advanced service
nodes.

49
TOP Decentralized Open Communication Network

8. Token Distribution

TOP plans to issue 20 billion TOP Tokens using ERC20 standard on Ethereum. After the launch of TOP
mainnet, the ERC20-based tokens will be mapped to the native tokens on TOP.

Token Distribution:
e Team — 15% of Tokens
e Foundation — 15% of Tokens
e Contributors — 22% of Tokens
e Mining — 38% of Tokens

e Business Partners, Marketing, Advisors — 10% of Tokens

Telos Foundation is an independent non-profit organization based in Singapore. Currently, Telos
Foundation, the operating entity of TOP, oversees TOP’s technical development, marketing and
governance. The long-term mission of Telos Foundation is to become a democratic governance body
serving all participants in the TOP ecosystem.

Operation transparency is the paramount principle of Telos Foundation. The foundation will regularly
release budgets, financial reports and operation plans to the community. Major decisions will be disclosed
to the community in advance to solicit comments.

The decision-making body in Telos Foundation is the executive committee, its members including
directors of the foundation, CEO and community representatives. Major matters, such as annual budget,
large expenditure and strategic plan, need the committee’s approval. The CEO directs the daily operation
of the foundation.

The standard committee under Telos Foundation formulates standards and rules in the TOP ecosystem.
The standard committee sets up multiple working groups focused respectively on issues including
security, community incentivization and community feedback. Standard committee members are elected
by the community.

11.1.2 Community Board

The community board is the legislative body responsible for on-chain governance, whose members are
elected by the community based on DPoS algorithm. The board votes on the standards, rules and draft
laws. A draft law endorsed by over 50% of board members becomes law. The community board has only
legislative power, while Telos Foundation is responsible for the enforcement of standards, rules, and
laws.

Telos Foundation organizes the election of the community board members. If needed, the foundation can
request the community to re-elect the community board.

11.2On-Chain Governance

11.2.1 On-Chain Governance Protocols

The on-chain governance of TOP is performed by a variety of modules such as version control, sharding
management and incentive mechanisms. Each module is assigned an account whose properties are
intended to store parameters. When the community board reaches an agreement on new parameters of a
specific module, each node will obtain the upgraded parameter values automatically by querying the
corresponding account. Thus, the parameter upgrade of the entire chain can be realized automatically.

11.2.2 The Governance Process

Each working group under the standard committee collects feedbacks from the community and submits
them to the committee. The standard committee then votes on the submitted proposals. The drafts
endorsed by over 50% of committee members will be signed by Telos Foundation and submitted to the
community board for on-chain voting, which is implemented through a smart contract. A draft that
receives over 50% of the votes by the board will become a formal resolution on TOP Chain.

11.2.3 Software Upgrades for Nodes

If the resolution approved by the community board requires nodes to upgrade their software, the nodes
will automatically download the latest software package upon notification and complete the upgrade
automatically after confirming the legitimacy of the downloaded software package.

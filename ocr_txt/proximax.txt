ProximaX White Paper v1.4

PAGE | 4

Abstract

The Internet: a vast framework of interconnected applications, networked systems and
mobile devices essential to our daily lives. It’s the primary means by which we
communicate, learn, create, shop, work, share, play and manage our finances. We cannot
imagine a world without it. Yet the very foundation of this technology, invented over a
quarter century ago, is in jeopardy. It suffers from vulnerabilities in scale, security and
privacy, and increasingly is prone to fraud. Together these threats will disrupt the
technology we have become so reliant upon. Businesses built on centralised computing
struggle to keep pace with ever-increasing scale of use, which drives up costs and further
limits accessibility to the developing world, where only the elite can profit from the

advantages of connectivity.

Challenges in privacy, confidentiality, data security and integrity, and centralised systems
have plagued the internet today. Traditional private, internet-related organisations have
attempted to resolve these challenges only selectively, as their profit motive is not aligned
with that of the consumer interests. The tech giants want their users to “trust” them

implicitly without actually addressing the underlying obstacles.

“Blockchain” Technology, the underlying innovation that powers Bitcoin and NEM,
promised more robust decentralised and distributed networks, thus eliminating costly
intermediaries and creating a human-powered, interconnected network, but it was not
without its flaws. Early versions of blockchain proved too complex, insecure, costly, and

unscalable to bridge the gap between theoretical and_ real-world utility.

ProximaX (pronounced Proxima X), a blockchain-based decentralised platform using the
NEM Blockchain and Catapult platform, intends to solve these challenges in an eco-friendly
distributed ledger technology, using P2P internet protocols and ease of integration API
driven architecture allowing DApp developers and businesses to more readily deploy and

manage their solutions.

ProximaX White Paper v1.4 PAGE |5
ProximaX extends traditional Blockchain protocols by integrating a number of off-chain,
peer-to-peer service components (layers) that are found in traditional SaaS and laaS based
centralised architectures, like content delivery networks (CDN) and cloud offerings. The
primary services being that of storage and streaming media - all managed and governed by
a robust set of consensus protocols to ensure integrity of the network along with
measuring, validating, and incentivizing the decentralised workforce to prosper and grow

scale.

By parallelizing all of these services and protocols in manageable, but distinct layers,
ProximaxX solves for the cost-effective conundrum in Blockchain ledger transactions, whilst
maintaining flexibility, ease of adoption and integration, security, and speed. All packaged

within an all-in-one extensible framework.

To maintain its integrity and value, ProximaX steps up the game from traditional blockchain
and introduces concurrent advanced and complex consensus algorithms with a
combination of 1) Proof-of-Ilmportance (Pol), perfected by NEM; 2) Proof-of-Storage
(PoSt), for measuring allocation of distributed disk space, and; 3) Proof-of-Bandwidth
(PoB), a costly and more precious commodity in delivery of data and streaming media - ina
side chain. Bandwidth measurement is rarely factored into mainstream blockchain projects

as a reward metric to the node workforce. ProximaX is changing that.

ProximaX further powers its utility token economy with a native token (using the NEM
mosaic), XPX, that allows for a sustainable marketplace for its services - only possible with

a best of breed blockchain engine found in NEM.

ProximaxX is a revolution on top of the existing evolution of Blockchain and DLT with the
creation of a utility-rich platform and protocol in which businesses, enterprises and
entrepreneurial innovators can avoid costly, failure-prone centralised architectures yet

enjoy sustainable and secure service offerings. Content Delivery and Storage, Streaming

Media, decentralised marketplaces, big-data, measurement/analytics, loT, and flawless

record keeping and Know Your Customer (“KYC”) are just a few use cases for ProximaX.

1. Introduction

The ProximaX protocol aims to offer DApp developers cost-efficient fault tolerant, multi-
layer, P2P cloud services including, but not limited to, blockchain-powered P2P storage and
bandwidth. A fault-tolerant system is designed to ensure a system remains fully functional
even when part of it is ‘down’ or unavailable. ProximaX will build a P2P cloud storage
architecture with fault tolerance and a distributed database by removing the central entity
and connecting all the servers (or nodes) in a mesh configuration. Failure of any single
component of the mesh will have minimal effect upon the overall performance of the
system. ProximaX protocol will ensure confidentiality and integrity of the data passing
through a myriad of nodes. The use of distributed databases (DHT) ensures consistency and

integrity throughout the network.

ProximaX distributed file management system (DFMS) interfaces with NEM blockchain

and works in four scenarios:

ProximaX Public DFMS with NEM Public chain
ProximaX Private DFMS with NEM Public Chain
ProximaX Public DFMS with NEM Private Chain
ProximaX Private DFMS with NEM Private Chain

RF wWN BP

ProximaX will provide DApp developers with an easy-to-use SDK that abstracts the
ProximaX protocol layer into a dynamic second layer on top of the NEM blockchain layer
that can carry different unique DApp protocols. This will ensure that the DApp developers
can build great P2P applications with the best possible security protocols without relying
on points of central authority. It will empower developers to build apps and monetise in the

ways they want without any unnecessary compliance pressure.

ProximaX White Paper v1.4 PAGE | 10
This solution makes use of the NEM blockchain for value and hash transaction and the NEM
cryptography framework to gain access to the ProximaX DFMS and work in a tightly integrated

environment based on the above four scenarios.

1.1. Challenges in Today's SaaS/laaS Platforms
1.1.1, Security Vulnerabilities

DDoS remains one of the bigger issues in centralised client/server architectures.
Decentralised systems offer no lightning rod for attacks thereby expanding the attack
surface almost infinitely as the system grows. ProximaX will fully utilise the nature of

decentralisation to obviate system outages due to malicious traffic.

1.1.2. Excessive Dependence on a Central Entity

A centralised system removes authority from the hands of users and controls all network
functionality. Dependency on such system means developers and creators are completely
reliant platforms and need to abide by the regulations they impose. Many platforms charge

creators for hosting space and storing their apps and content.

1.1.3. System Downtime and Failures

Centralised systems also face absolute failure or downtime due to poor server access or
connection time. This is a crucial challenge, especially for apps and cloud services. A
decentralised system has faster access time due to the peer-to-peer connections and
eliminates faulty data transfers due to the public ledger that verifies all transactions and

exchanges.

ProximaX White Paper v1.4 PAGE |11
1.1.4. Cost and Edge Scale

Centralised systems have inherent scalability issues as all processing must be routed
through centralised nodes in a hub and spoke like fashion. As systems become more
decentralised and distributed, scalability increases. A fully distributed mesh platform with
Centralised systems also face absolute failure or downtime due to poor server access or
connection time. This is a crucial challenge, especially for apps and cloud services. A
Decentralised system has faster access time due to the peer-to-peer connections and
eliminates faulty data transfers due to the public ledger that verifies all transactions and

exchanges.

Additionally, scalability is limited by the reach and geolocations of traditional data centres
and hosting facilities leveraged by today’s corporations and cloud providers. The edge
networks that are supposed to bring content closer to the users are thereby also limited
and may actually be thousands of miles away. Decentralisation extends beyond corporate

domain and leverages real-world people that are more geographically diverse.

Lastly, the more middlemen, the costlier. Centralised corporations dictate usage costs to

pay for their infrastructure and profits and pass them on to business and consumers.

1.1.5. Threat of Censorship

The controlling entity of any network enjoys the liberty of monitoring and filtering content
from its users. This censorship can be based on personal and political agendas that mask or
rewrite the truth from an audience or violate the right of free speech of the content

creators. Media platforms misuse this control to their advantage.

ProximaX White Paper v1.4 PAGE | 12
1.2. Limitations of Today’s Blockchains

Though distributed, Blockchain network nodes perform little to no parallel processing.
Blockchain nodes perform identical operations in verifying same transactions in
accordance with the same rules. Blockchain nodes store the entire history, which is the
same for all nodes. These are large chunks of data. The growth of HDD capacity definitely
lags behind the current blockchain circumstances of storing tens of GBs of transactions
data per month where the number of transactions is constantly rising. Such limitations
reflect on high blockchain transaction fees and limit the size of transaction data. For that,
todays blockchains are slow, expensive, hardly scalable and very limited when it comes to

storing information.

In addition, current blockchain and DLT solutions force developers to augment or add off-
chain solutions to complete tasks that provide significant utility, such as storage. This can
lead to the creation of centralised dependencies unless the investment in additional peer-
to-peer services are added and coupled with the blockchain. The conclusion, blockchain
and DLT alone cannot possibly provide the functionality necessary to allow for replacement
services to transitional SaaS and laaS architecture. This has led to multiple competing
bespoke implementations and ICO’s requiring developers to potentially leverage multiple
implementations, versus one. This increases complexity and generates friction and risk.

That is, until now...

2. Opportunity: ProximaX Protocols and
Service Layers

ProximaX strives to provide solutions for long-standing problems by creating a NEM
blockchain-powered platform that consists of the following major on-chain and off-chain
protocols generating a wide range of decentralised services with infinite possibilities to the

developers:

2.1. DFMS P2P File Storage Solution Based on IPFS

ProximaxX is providing storage solution which is based on the Distributed File Management
System (DFMS), that is essentially a peer-to-peer distributed architecture making the
network decentralised and users free from the influence of any third-party storage
provider. It also allows client-side encryption making the data secure. The system is
immune to traditional threats of security and privacy as the system is based on an
encrypted, sharded file storage in a peer-to-peer network. Absence of any central authority
makes the network accessible 100 percent of the time as if some nodes go offline the next

sufficient node takes its place.

The P2P decentralised cloud storage network is based on IPFS that comes with the

following significant benefits:

High Availability. Files are replicated across peers to ensure that they are always available

to be consumed by any peers on the network.

Fault Tolerant. Peers on the network allows operational continuity in the event of single or
multiple peer failure or downtime. This essentially means that If one peer or group of peers

goes down, the network storage locates the closest peer available to continue its operation.

Deduplication. The solution will have a data compression technology that detects duplicate

files and avoid copying the same file to the network.

Content Addressable Storage (CAS). A mechanism for storing information that can be
retrieved based on its content, not its storage location. This essentially means that files
uploaded to the network will always have a hash that’s based on the content of the file

making it uniquely distinctive from any similar files.

ProximaX White Paper v1.4 PAGE |15
High Performance. The distributed architecture scales better than a traditional centralised
storage. The storage solution will scale based on the number of peers that participates on
the network. The more peers who participates, the more performant (in terms of storage

and bandwidth) the solution will be.

Clustered/Distributed. Peers that are part of the network ensure that the data is replicated

across to maximise availability.

Immutability. Every file uploaded cannot be removed or modified by any peers on the
network. This is because files are all identifiable via a hash that uses the file's content
(known as Content-addressable storage). This identification system ensures that every file

version is unique and won't overwrite any similar file on the network.

Access Content Offline (caching). A caching mechanism on the consumer (client) side
ensures that when a content is loaded, it caches it so that it will still be available even if the

consumer goes offline.

Multihash Protocol. The solution uses multihash protocol for differentiating outputs from
various well-established cryptographic hash functions, addressing size and encoding

considerations.

Web Service HTTP API. The P2P storage nodes will have a built in Exposed Web Services
endpoints for developers to easily integrate the storage with their Decentralised

Applications.

A P2P decentralised cloud storage network based on the IPFS solution and integrated with
the NEM Public/Private blockchain technology, offers many advantages that centralised
cloud storage does not. Client-side encryption ensures data security and a “Proof of
Retrievability” that maintains data integrity. ProximaX P2P cloud storage network can

significantly reduce the impact of security breaches and infrastructure failures. This open

ProximaX White Paper v1.4 PAGE | 16
and democratised market will greatly reduce the cost of P2P cloud storage networks.
Moreover, the data hosted on the P2P cloud storage network will be resistant to data

failures, unauthorised access, tampering, and censorship.

2.2. Real-time Streaming with the PeerStreaam
Protocol (PSP)

ProximaX will utilise the PeerStream Protocol (PSP), a privacy P2P messaging, online
presence, routing, real-time streaming protocol that is presently in development and
designed to enable secure off-chain communication channels between crypto identities.

PSP will be used in ProximaX streaming layer to ensure users and nodes privacy.

At its core PSP is a designed to be a privacy routing protocol. Unlike onion and |2P routing,
PSP will be insulated and eliminates the risk of maintaining exit nodes and out-proxies. PSP
will serve privacy routing via entry nodes and temporary interconnected routing circuits to

privately connect users, DApps, loTs, live and stored contents in the ProximaX ecosystem.
The PSP layer will ensure the following benefits to end users and DApp developers:

Namespaced DApp Protocols. ProximaX DApps will have the flexibility to design their own

unique namespaced protocols to be carried by the PSP protocol.

Distributed Authentication and Verification. In PSP users will directly authenticate and
verify one another using crypto identities rather than trusting central authentication
services where service integrity, confidentiality, availability and authenticity cannot be

guaranteed.

ProximaX White Paper v1.4 PAGE |17
Distributed Presence. The PSP protocol will enable users to announce their presence
status privately without revealing any PIl and meta-data such as users IP addresses. In the
PSP protocol users’ crypto identities will be used to authenticate and verify presence

events in a distributed manner.

Clustered/Distributed Presence and Real-time Streaming. Peers that are part of the
network ensure that streams and presence data are replicated across to maximise

availability.

Private and Anonymous Routing. Privacy routing and anonymous discovery to maintain

maximum level of anonymity for all participants

Distributed Content Creation. Empowering content creators by enabling creators to

stream their content directly without a middleman

2.3. Blockchain - NEM’s NextGen “Catapult”
Technology

As a base offering, ProximaX will be adapted to use NEM’s Catapult technology to operate
in NEM’s public blockchain eventually, enabling anyone to join and participate in a common
network. An incentivisation mechanism will be implemented to encourage more users to
join and participate in this network, in addition to the Pol and harvesting incentivisation
already existing in the NEM public network. The Proof-of-Importance consensus
(discussed in detail in next sections) will be expanded with a secondary layer of consensus
protocols measuring and rewarding storage and bandwidth contribution so that XPX
rewards can be given out (a side chain may have to be created). DApp developers will be
given the liberty and flexibility to design their own unique monetisation model through

configurable economy models.

ProximaX White Paper v1.4 PAGE |18
2.4. Consensus Protocols

ProximaxX will use multi-layered Consensus protocols for voting, governance, harvesting,
and to reward network nodes contributing storage and bandwidth resources to the
network. ProximaX nodes, DApp developers, and content creators will be paid in XPX
tokens based on their activities on the platform as discussed in the next sections of this
document. Three major consensus protocols will be used to govern on chain and off chain

resources, services and activities:

e Proof-of-Importance (Pol): This is a blockchain consensus mechanism introduced
by NEM. The function is similar to Proof-of-Stake where the nodes need to ‘vest’ an
amount of currency to become eligible for creating blocks. However, in Pol user's
importance is determined by how many tokens they have and the number of
transactions made to and from their wallet. In Pol transactions volume, one's overall

support of the network, and trust become factors.

e Proof-of-Storage (PoSt): Also called Proof-of-Capacity, PoSt is a method where a
single node dedicates a non-trivial amount of disk-space to solve a challenge
presented by the service provider. PoSt is very similar to Proof-of-Work, the
difference is instead of computation, storage is used. Proof-of-Storage is relevant

yet considerably different from, memory-hard functions and proofs of retrievability.
e Proof-of-Bandwidth (PoB): ProximaX will use multiple oracle verification

mechanisms to report and validate P2P nodes bandwidth contribution to the

network.

3. Decentralised Applications in ProximaX

3.1. File Hosting Services

ProximaX can be deployed in a private mode in the form of a decentralised privately-owned
network of file storage and sharing where clients can synchronise and organise files across

multiple devices automatically and privately in a protected environment.

3.2. File Sharing

With ProximaX, users can seamlessly and securely share their files and data without the
issue of trust. They will always know how and where their data, confidential information,
and files are being used. The blockchain identity verification will prevent many kinds of

security problems.

3.3. Content Creation and Monetisation

ProximaX Dapp developers will have the flexibility to design Dapps for different kinds of content
creation in the ProximaX ecosystem. Where ProximaX consensus protocols will reward content
creators periodically as their contents are being viewed. Subscribed ProximaX users can support
content creators by simply viewing their contents (ProximaX subscription and dynamically-

configurable economy model discussed in detail in next sections).

3.4. Content Control

Part of the consensus protocol will manage the filtering of illegal or offensive content.

While this is an open and apolitical platform, it is essential to allow the clients of the system

ProximaX White Paper v1.4 PAGE | 21
to flag and remove content. If a sufficient percentage of the customer base downvotes
content, storage and broadcasts will be restricted. In the absence of central authority, this

mechanism will ensure a secure and safe experience.

3.5. Secure Multimedia and Message Streaming

Attribution of streams is anonymous in Proximax. It will not be possible to determine the
IP address or personal information of a stream creator. Content viewers will enjoy the
same anonymity. This is the key feature of the streaming component of ProximaX: total
privacy and anonymity. Presence and discovery will be obfuscated via privacy routes so
that no server will be aware of the contents. Only the end-user participants will be able to

produce or view the content intended for them.

3.6. Know Your Customer (KYC)

Fraud prevention is an even bigger challenge in decentralised systems. ProximaX will
integrate a KYC feature to know the audience, developers, and content creators. The KYC
feature will inform the consensus layer to cut down on fraud and identify malicious nodes

whilst maintaining security and zero-proof privacy and anonymity as is necessary.

4. Economic Model

ProximaX will develop a dynamically-configurable economy model that is based on periodic
(monthly/annual) subscription. ProximaX users will periodically use the native token (XPX)
to subscribe to the network in exchange to ‘ProximaX Power’ (PXP). ProximaX will develop
asystem to define, charge, and consume user's ‘power’ over subscription periods. Payments
will take place on a side-chain ‘power’ layer rather than the core blockchain transaction
layer. Power layer will have a consensus model tuned for higher frequency power
distribution. Power will be allotted to users via cross-chain exchanges with the core NEM

blockchain transaction layer.

4.1. ProximaX Monetisation Parties

In ProximaX there are three major parties that can expect to get paid in the dynamically-

configurable economy model:

e ProximaX nodes (Blockchain + Storage + Bandwidth) (ALWAYS PAID)
e ProximaX Decentralised Application (DApp) developers

e ProximaX Users (content providers / creators)

ProximaxX will provide a set of APIs for app developers to configure different app economy
models. For example, an app developer can define distribution of the consumer users’
subscribed power as: 30% for ProximaX Network, 10% for app developer, and 60% for
content providers. Another app can be configured to charge 0% and distribute the

consumer users’ power across the network and content providers or only to the network.

The economy API set will have a minimum required limit for power distribution to the
network nodes. The higher the app pays the network, the higher importance score will be
assigned to the app namespace/protocol, which in turn results in higher network resources

quality of service (QoS).

ProximaX White Paper v1.4 PAGE | 24
4.2. DApp Monetisation Model

ProximaxX will use a subscription monetisation model where users periodically subscribe to
the network to add ‘power’ to their accounts. A user’s POWER will be measured and
controlled by ProximaX consensus protocols looking at network resources consumed by
the user. In return, ProximaX consensus protocol will pay app developers and app content

creators with native XPX tokens equivalent to the power spent by DApp users.

Instead of defining a single economy model, ProximaX will provide a dynamic economy
model via a configurable API set, giving DApp developers the flexibility to edit and

configure their own unique economy model.

4.3. DApp Freemium Model

ProximaX will provide mechanisms to enable freemium models using commercial nodes.
Commercial nodes in ProximaX are centralised nodes owned and hosted by the DApp
developer yet connected to the ProximaX distributed network. Commercial nodes will
subscribe to the ProximaX platform to enable a freemium model for DApp protocols. In
return ProximaxX will serve the DApp users for free as the commercial node will cover the

network expense of carrying and serving the DApp protocol.

4.4. ProximaX Commercial Nodes

The commercial node model aims to solve two different problems: to support a freemium
structure and to enable flexible backend support for DApp’s beyond ProximaX protocol
capabilities. Commercial nodes can be used by DApp developers to host dynamic backend

business logic.

ProximaX White Paper v1.4 PAGE | 30
6. XPX Token Distribution

The ProximaX project is an open source project that is meant to be publicly owned, used
and deployed. The solution integrates and uses the NEM public blockchain to manage the
tokens in the form of Mosaic. There shall be transaction fee associated with each
transaction in the form of XEM that is required to transfer XPX. The XPX token arising out
of this has no security instrument tied to it and is a consumptive or utility token the value

of which is determined by market demand and supply.

6.1. XPX Distribution Structure

The XPX token will be distributed through the Initial Coin Offering campaign. The final

number of XPX tokens per Stake to be issued depends on the number of Stakes subscribed.

“Stake(s)” means the right to acquire a certain number of XPX tokens from ProximaX as

more particularly described below:

(a) The total XPX token supply will be nine billion (9,000,000,000).

(b) Each Stake shall be sold for USD$ 750.00 at the applicable NEM (“XEM”), Ethereum
(“ETH”), Bitcoin (“BTC”) or Xarcade tokens [as described in www.xarcade.io] (“XAR”)
price determined by Proximax and specified on the Proximax Website
(www.proximax.io) at the time of purchase.

(c) Stakes may be purchased in fractions of 0.1 of a Stakes.

(d) There will be a private sale of Stakes (a pre-ICO) (the “Private Sale”) where private

investors shall be invited to purchase large block offerings of Stakes at a discount.

ProximaX White Paper v1.4 PAGE |31
(f)

(h)

i)

The Private Sale shall take place first and thereafter a public sale (the “Public Sale”)
whereby contributors will be able to register on the Website to purchase Stakes at
USD$ 750 per Stake. The Public Sale shall take place during the Public Sale Period (15
April to 25 April 2018).

Five billion (5,000,000,000) XPX (the “5 billion Tokens”) will be sold during Private
Sale and the Public Sale (the “Token Sale Period”). Four billion (4,000,000,000) XPX
(the “Reserved Tokens”) shall be retained by ProximaX for distribution to the
founders, the core team, vendors, for marketing and for use by a not-for-profit
foundation to be formed by ProximaxX in order to promote and develop the ProximaX

platform for the long term.

Stakes sold during the Token Sale Period shall entitle contributors to acquire a
proportion of the 5 billion Tokens only. Contributors shall not be entitled to receive
any proportion of the Reserved Tokens. Stakes, therefore, refer to the right to acquire

a proportion of the 5 billion Tokens only.

The final number of XPX per Stake to be issued by ProximaX will depend upon the

number of Stakes purchased by contributors during the Token Sale Period.

A maximum of 150,000 (one hundred and fifty thousand) Stakes shall be sold during

the Token Sale Period and once this target is reached, no more Stakes shall be sold.

The 5 billion Tokens shall be divided by the total number of Stakes sold during the
Token Sale Period. Each contributor shall receive a share of the 5 billion Tokens
proportionate to the number of Stakes they have each purchased. The number of XPX
due to each contributor shall be calculated by dividing 5 billion by the final number of
Stakes sold during the Token Sale Period. XPX shall be issued in fractions of up to 6

decimal places. For example:

ProximaX White Paper v1.4 PAGE | 32
e If 100% of the 150,000 Stakes are sold during the Token Sale Period, each
Contributor shall receive 33,333.333333 XPX per Stake purchased (5 billion /
[150,000 x 1.00)).

e If only 75% of the 150,000 Stakes are sold during the Token Sale Period, each
Contributor shall receive 44,444.444444 XPX per Stake purchased (5 Billion /
[150,000 X 0.75].

See below setting out the above examples in a table:

Total number of Stakes sold Total number of XPX per Stake
150,000 33,333.333333
112,500 44,444.444444

6.2. Distribution of Stakes

The 4 billion Reserved Tokens shall be used to reward incumbent contributors and

ProximaX proposes to distribute them as follows:

(a) 5.85% of the Reserved Tokens - 234 million (234,000,000) XPX to be made
available to the Founders. This represents 2.6% of the total token supply.

(b) 9% of the Reserved Tokens - 360 million (360,000,000) XPX to be made available
to the Core Team. This represents 4% of the total token supply.

ProximaX White Paper v1.4 PAGE | 33
(c) 9.9% of the Reserved Tokens - 396 million (396,000,000) XPX to be made

available to the Vendor, PeerStream Inc. This represents 4.4% of the total token

supply.

(d) 11.25% of the Reserved Tokens - 450 million (450,000,000) XPX to be made

available for marketing. This represents 5% of the total token supply.

(e) 64% of the Reserved Tokens - 2.56 billion (2,560,000,000) to be transferred to a
not-for-profit foundation to be formed by ProximaX. This represents 28.44% of
the total token supply. The charter of the foundation will be to promote the
ProximaxX platform to all industries and the XPX tokens shall be expended for its
development, marketing and operation costs in the long term. The raised amount

will be transferred to the foundation to develop a sustainable model in perpetuity.

9. Conclusion

There is no question amongst experts in this domain that blockchain is a progressive
starting point in technological innovation. However, it is just that: “a start.” Blockchain and
Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is a market catalyst to adoption and transformation.
As a driver of new currencies like Bitcoin, it is purpose-built. On its own, it is limited and
requires significant additive solutions and protocols in parallel to provide useful, easily
adopted services that can cross the divide between a “pure technology play” to real-world
application and utility. This lies at the crux of what ProximaX serves to solve. Current in-
market implementations and developing blockchain projects have only solved for utility in
small and limited implementations or have overshot the mark with largely unsustainable,
albeit powerful, virtual machines. Consider these projects as prototypes, permutations in
the inevitable and continual march that will produce the standards of the future. ProximaX
proudly stands on the shoulders of those prototypes. ProximaxX is a leap forward, providing
a holistic solution that combines on- and off-chain services and protocols, now purpose-
built for utility and the necessary replacement of end-of-life, traditionally centralised

architectures. It is a revolution: Blockchain reimagined and evolved.

10. Terminology

Term Definition

Simulation of human intelligence processes
by machines, especially computer systems.

Artificial Intelligence (Al)

A mechanism whereby decisions are made
by consensus. In the context of the
blockchain technology, it is a mechanism
whereby the decision making is automatic
by computer nodes participating in the
network and each verifying one another,
making its own decision independently and
then concurring collectively. The majority
that agrees will decide if a transaction is
valid or not.

Consensus

Associative storage or abbreviated CAS, is a
mechanism for storing information that can
be retrieved based on its content, not on its
storage location.

Content Addressable Storage (CAS)

A geographically distributed network of

Content Delivery Network (CDN)
servers and data warehouse centre

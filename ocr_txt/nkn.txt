Introduction

According to Gartner’s report [1], global IT spending is going to reach $3.7 trillion in 2018, among which
communications/network services continue to drive most of the spending. The $1.4 trillion-dollar communication service
business shows a huge potential when NKN incorporates it with blockchain technology.

NKN (New Kind of Network) is the new generation of highly scalable, self-evolving and self-incentivised, decentralised
network. By applying blockchain technology to the third pillar of the Internet infrastructure, NKN revolutionises the
blockchain ecosystem by innovating on the network layer, after Bitcoin [2]/Ethereum [3] applied blockchain technology
to computing power as well as IPFS [4]/Filecoin [5] applied blockchain technology to storage.

01
NKN is a decentralised data transmission and connectivity network with its native digital cryptographically-secured utility
token, NKN. NKN introduces self-incentivised sharing mechanism to ensure the continued validity of resource sharing.
Clients spend NKN transmit data, and relay nodes get NKN through relaying data for clients as well as by contributing to
the expansion and sharing of the network connectivity and transmission capacity.

In addition, miners receive NKN rewards for system contributions. NKN encourages individuals or organisations at each
transmission node to contribute or share idle network resources through awarding NKN. This promotes the construction
of a new mode of data resource transmission and ensure the continuity of network transmission resource sharing.

Resources are required for the provision of network connectivity, transmission capacity, thus nkn would provide the
economic incentive for the provision of these consumed resources. nkn is an integral and indispensable part of NKN,
because in the absence of nkn, there would be no economic incentive for participants to provide these resources, thus
rendering the ecosystem on NKN unsustainable.

nkn is designed to achieve fairness between sharing the network transmission resources and receiving the rewards. Our
methodology is verifiable, transparent, and backed by mathematics. nkn is the foundation of the NKN ecosystem. nkn
distribution is limited and the amount of mining output declines linearly over time. It becomes increasingly difficult to
acquire nkn over time. Specifically, the production mechanism of nkn is divided into two parts: the first part is created
at genesis; the second part is obtained by miners through mining.

Strategic revamp of network layer

After years of evolution, blockchain application in computing and storage has been thoroughly explored and recognised
by more and more people. Yet, there is a lack of breakthrough in fundamental research in blockchain.

NKN introduces strategic innovation into the network layer of the blockchain system. It sets network connectivity and
transmission capacity as the core resources to be tokenised and thus shared, while Proof of Relay becomes a new type of
"Proof of Work". Furthermore, NKN introduces Cellular Automata [6,7] into the network layer to create self-evolving
network topology.

NKN solves the existing challenges in blockchain networks, such as scalability of the network, lack of peer equality and
extensibility. By using Cellular Automata to improve the efficiency of blockchain, NKN will achieve peer equality of all
nodes in the network.

Being complementary to decentralised computing power (Bitcoin [2]/Ethereum [3]) and decentralised storage
(IPFS/Filecoin [4,5]), NKN primarily focuses on network connectivity and data transmission. NKN makes peer-to-peer
networks more reliable and secure, enabling healthier and safer networking layers.

Tokenisation of network connectivity and data
transmission capability

In addition to innovating the blockchain network layer, NKN proposes to tokenise network connectivity and data
transmission capability. The new economic model will encourage participants to share their connectivity, bandwidth to
fully leverage their idle network resources to achieve productive resource sharing. Hence, improving the utilisation of
network resources and enhancing network transmission capacity. nkn is a major component of the ecosystem on NKN,
and is designed to be used solely on the network. nkn has the following characteristics:

02
1) Proof of utility
Token utility can be verified at the time of creation. Self-incentivised native nkn is a non-refundable functional utility token

which will be used as the unit of exchange between participants in the NKN ecosystem, which compensates network
resource sharing such as connectivity and data transmission capability.

© Fungibility
nkn can be exchanged freely within the NKN network and can be traded and exchanged between participants in the NKN
ecosystem.

6 Privacy

nkn is innately anonymous, with authenticity and tamper-proof guaranteed by cryptography. Additionally, nkn is backed
and safeguarded by mathematics.

The sharing mechanism based on network connectivity and data transmission capability is the backbone of the NKN
project that will span through the entire project’s design.

It can be said that the sharing mechanism based on the connectivity and data transmission capability of the network layer
is not just a general outline of the entire project, but also a guiding instruction for specific details within the project’s
design. Enabling it leads to future development of blockchain technology.

Economic Model

nkn does not in any way represent any shareholding, participation, right, title, or interest in NKN Foundation Ltd. (the
Foundation), its affiliates, or any other company, enterprise or undertaking, nor will nkn entitle token holders to any
promise of fees, revenue, profits or investment returns, and are not intended to constitute securities in Singapore or any
relevant jurisdiction. nkn may only be utilised on NKN, and ownership of nkn carries no rights, express or implied, other
than the right to use nkn as a means to enable usage of and interaction with NKN. In particular, you understand and
accept that nkn:

(a) does not represent or confer on the token holder any right of any form with respect to the Foundation (or any of its
affiliates) or its revenues or assets, including without limitation any right to receive future revenue, shares, ownership
right or stake, share or security, any voting, distribution, redemption, liquidation, proprietary (including all forms of
intellectual property), or other financial or legal rights or equivalent rights, or intellectual property rights or any other
form of participation in or relating to NKN, the Foundation, the Distributor and/or their service providers;

(b) is non-refundable and cannot be exchanged for cash (or its equivalent value in any other virtual currency) or any
payment obligation by the Foundation or any affiliate;

(c) is not intended to be a representation of money (including electronic money), security, commodity, bond, debt
instrument or any other kind of financial instrument or investment;

(d) is not a loan to the Foundation or any of its affiliates, is not intended to represent a debt owed by the Foundation or
any of its affiliates, and there is no expectation of profit; and

(e) does not provide the token holder with any ownership or other interest in the Foundation or any of its affiliates. The

total quantity of nkn released will be one billion. In the beginning of the system operation, 70% nkn will be generated.

The remaining 30% will be generated by transmission network mining after the mainnet is launched, which will take place
over a period of 25 years in declining quantities. The annual supply quantity of nkn produced (Q), in unit of millions, is
distributed based on the time variable "T", which can be mined in accordance with the formula below:

Qnkn = 18.5-0.5T, 1STS25

Total amount of nkn is limited and mining output declines linearly with time. This incentivises early participation in the
NKN network. The cost of nkn is determined by the bid between the client and the miner (similar to Ethereum system
fee); therefore, changes in the market price for nkn will not affect the equivalent price of transaction or relay fees.

The smallest unit in NKN is Qi, where 1 Qi= 104 nkn. Aseries of units are defined between Qi and nkn for convenience,
as shown in Table 1. Qi will be used for micropayment to meet the ever-expanding data transmission demands.

Implementation of such unit metrics enables highly accurate micropayments on NKN’s platform. It should be noted that
the actual usage of the above nkn unit prefixes is dependent upon the degree of NKN’s network development. Optimal
unit prefix can be selected for usage based on the demand of network development in connectivity, capability, and
data transmission. The allocation of nkn is shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Allocation of nkn percentage.

35% (350 million) of the total amount is made available to purchasers; 18% (180 million) of the total amount is reserved
for developers and advisors and transferred to them over a 3-year period; 17% (170 million) of the total amount is reserved
for the Foundation for building the NKN community and network; the remaining 30% (300 million) will be generated
through "mining" over an estimated 25-year period. Each newly generated block will generate fresh nkn as an incentive
for miners per the stated rule specified above.

nkn is based on blockchain technology to ensure that the data of consumption and sharing contributions cannot be
falsified. Through a decentralised ledger, it ensures that all records are valid and transparent.

nkn is also the driving force in NKN’s ecosystem and an influential factor in cultivating a healthy and stable ecosystem.
Exchanges and rewards of nkn drive users to share their network resources or even upgrade their hardware, thus
enhancing the whole network capacity. NKN users can use nkn to exchange network resources, embracing the era of
enhanced network connectivity and data transmission capability.

Pricing of transmission capacity of nodes in the NKN network will be directly negotiated between service providers and
clients.

nkn Distribution Metrics

We want to take time to explain the numbers around nkn distribution. We hope that this will clear up any confusions
surrounding the upcoming nkn token sale. The distributor of nkn (the Distributor) shall be an affiliate of the Foundation.

Token Supply and Sale

( ) The overall amount of NKN will be fixed at 1 billion.

Osx of NKN token will be offered to purchasers.

05
The contributions in the token sale will be held by the Distributor (or its affiliate) after the token sale, and contributors
will have no economic or legal right over or beneficial interest in these contributions or the assets of that entity after the
token sale. To the extent a secondary market or exchange for trading NKN does develop, it would be run and operated
wholly independently of NKN Foundation, the Distributor. Neither the Foundation nor the Distributor will create such
secondary markets nor will either entity act as an exchange for NKN.

Developers & Advisors

42% 18% of NKN will be reserved for developers and advisors, and will be transferred to them over a 3-year period. Upon
the expiry of 1 year, the team will receive 1/3 of this allocation, with a further 1/3 of this allocation to be distributed

upon the expiry of each year thereafter, until the 3-year period is up.

Foundation Reserve

“= The 17% reserved for the Foundation will be used for referral programs, incentives, and marketing initiatives aimed
to promote the user base. The Foundation will also cover for expenditures in areas of legal and consulting services,
strategic initiatives, operational overheads, dApp ecosystem support, and expansion of the NKN network
infrastructure. The Board of Directors of the Foundation is tasked with managing the use of resources for the
development of NKN for the best benefit of all users, participants and stakeholders, including operation management,
market promotion, development of underlying technology and construction of service system, planning and
technology development.

Miner

S 30% of NKN will be awarded to miners once the MainNet is live online.

Disclaimers and Risks

This document is intended for distribution to a selective community of audiences, and may not be copied, reproduced,
distributed or disseminated in any way without the prior written consent of the Foundation.

You acknowledge and agree that there are numerous risks associated with purchasing NKN, holding NKN, and using NKN

for participation in NKN:

1. Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions
The regulatory status of NKN and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. The
regulation of virtual currencies has become a primary target of regulation in all major countries in the world. It is
impossible to predict how, when or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulations or create new
regulations with respect to such technology and its applications, including NKN token and/or NKN. Regulatory actions
could negatively impact NKN token and/or NKN in various ways. The Foundation (or its affiliates) may cease
operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to
operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to
operate in such jurisdiction.
After consulting with a wide range of legal advisors and continuous analysis of the development and legal structure
of virtual currencies, the Foundation will apply a cautious approach towards the sale of NKN. Therefore, for the
crowdsale, the Foundation may constantly adjust the sale strategy in order to avoid relevant legal risks as much as
possible. For the crowdsale, the Foundation is working with Tzedek Law LLC, a boutique corporate law firm in
Singapore with a good reputation in the blockchain space.

2. Inadequate disclosure of information
As at the date hereof, NKN is still under development and its design concepts, consensus mechanisms, algorithms,
codes, and other technical details and parameters may be constantly and frequently updated and changed. Although
this white paper contains the most current information relating to NKN, it is not absolutely complete and may still be
adjusted and updated by the NKN team from time to time. The NKN team has no ability and obligation to keep holders

of NKN informed of every detail (including development progress and expected milestones) regarding the project to
develop NKN, hence insufficient information disclosure is inevitable and reasonable.

3. Competitors
Various types of decentralised applications are emerging at a rapid rate, and the industry is increasingly competitive.
It is possible that alternative networks could be established that utilise the same or similar code and protocol
underlying NKN and/or NKN and attempt to re-create similar facilities. NKN may be required to compete with these
alternative networks, which could negatively impact NKN and/or NKN.

4. Loss of Talent
The development of NKN depends on the continued co-operation of the existing technical team and expert
consultants, who are highly knowledgeable and experienced in their respective sectors. The loss of any member may
adversely affect NKN or its future development. Further, stability and cohesion within the team is critical to the overall
development of NKN. There is the possibility that conflict within the team and/or departure of core personnel may
occur, resulting in negative influence on the project in the future.

5. Failure to develop
There is the risk that the development of NKN will not be executed or implemented as planned, for a variety of
reasons, including without limitation the event of a decline in the prices of any digital asset, virtual currency or NKN,
unforeseen technical difficulties, and shortage of development funds for activities.

6. Security weaknesses
Hackers or other malicious groups or organisations may attempt to interfere with NKN and/or NKN in a variety of
ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks,
smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, there is a risk that a third party or a member of the Foundation or its affiliates
may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure of NKN token and/or NKN,
which could negatively affect NKN token and/or NKN.
Further, the future of cryptography and security innovations are highly unpredictable and advances in cryptography,
or technical advances (including without limitation development of quantum computing), could present unknown
risks to NKN token and/or NKN by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins

that blockchain protocol.
07
Other risks

In addition to the aforementioned risks, there are other risks (as more particularly set out in the Terms and Conditions)
associated with your purchase, holding and use of NKN, including those that the Foundation cannot anticipate. Such

risks may further materialise as unanticipated variations or combinations of the aforementioned risks. You should

conduct full due diligence on the Foundation, its affiliates and the NKN team, as well as understand the overall

framework and vision for NKN prior to purchasing NKN token.

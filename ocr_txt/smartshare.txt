Summary

Smartshare Protocol is a distributed network protocol that uses blockchain
technology and smart contracts to evaluate and quantify the substantive
value of all sharable objects, which can realize the exchange of sharing

value.

The birth of Smartshare as a value sharing protocol will greatly promote
the growth of popular industries such as the Internet of things (loT) and
the sharing economy. One reason is the combination of intelligent loT
devices and blockchain technology will accelerate technical change of
smart loT application. The other is through the integration of idle products
and service resource, sharing economy makes users get products and
services. Our country encourages the development of sharing economy.
However, many sharing models are centralized leasing models, existing
some gaps with ideal decentralized sharing of idle products. Smartshare
uses the blockchain technology to achieve the decentralization sharing of
individual value, making the real shared entity become the network node.
Smartshare will utilize blockchain to inject new energy into sharing

economy, and all sharable products can obtain value return.

Smartshare provides an open ssp-based smartshare protocol to apply in
sharing economy. We are committed to make use of the sharing value of
stipulated contract terminal to realize the value output of current smart

terminal through sharing mechanism.
1. Origin of Smartshare

1.1 Why build Smartshare

It needs to look at the roles of protocol in blockchain. Compare the model
of Internet and blockchain, we can see that the sharing agreement of
Internet such as TCP/IP, HTTP, SMTP, most of which are gained and
rearranged in data form at the application layer. However, in terms of ROI,
the return of the investment in protocol is far below than that of the
application, and the return of TCP/IP is much less than that of Google,
Facebook and Wechat. As for blockchain, the protocols and application
performance are in contrast to Internet, for example, the assessed value
of BTC and ETH is much higher than that of application, which mainly lies
in that the Internet is developed from the decentralization to centralization,
but the evolvement of blockchain is opposite with it. As most applications
already existed in the development of blockchain, we not only need to
utilize the protocol of blockchain to upgrade the existed applications, but
also need to copy and store user’s data through the open-source and
decentralization Internet, and lower the threshold of new participants, build
an ecosystem to make the products and services related to the protocols

more active and competitive.

Despite the limited use cases, the utilization of blockchain technology in
applications that focused on the sharing economy was already available
before the birth of Smartshare. However, during the implementation
process, these applications can only be applied in one industry, resulting
in the well low promotion rate of protocol, therefore it is a centralized

application in essence. Smarshare is to use open and decentralized
network protocol to lower the threshold to join in the sharing economy,

creating a sharing ecosystem across the category and region.

1.2 Social value of Smartshare

While resources are ubiquitous, the best use of them is not only an
esteem foe us, but a crucial method to protect ourselves and the earth. At
this present moment where resources are abundant, billions of terminal
devices, including those under the cover of sharing platform, are not
utilized optimally. Smartshare’s ideology is to promote cooperative
sharing, where all terminals will be part of the sharing economy for both
sharer and receiver to exchange value and benefit from it. The goal of
Smartshare is to build a sharing community that is not only convenient for
people, but can solve the problem of resource waste resulted by
information asymmetry,. Smartshare uses technology to bring us into a

virtuous circle of full utilization of resource.

SmartShare sharing protocol uses the decentralized nature of blockchain
to realize value sharing across society. By virtue of the protocol,

everyone can enjoy the convenience and benefit from sharing resources,

than social overhead capital will be reduced.
2. Blockchain Technology and it’s Shared Economy

2.1 The Current State of the Sharing Economy

Smart living and smart manufacturing are the two main growth-driver of
smart hardware industry. As technology, related infrastructure and
application service get better over time, smart hardware now includes not
only smartphones, but wearables, furnitures, in-car entertainment system,
medical appliances, smart autonomous system and so on. The adoption of
smart hardware in industrial, medical, automotive and agricultural
industries has been accelerated due to the recent development of loT,

“Internet+”, Artificial intelligence, Machine Learning, etc.

The development of a sharing economy has created a new business
model that maximizes the resources utilization and greatly facilitates
people's daily lives. The primary benefits of sharing economy are reflected
in the better allocation and circulation of resources, reducing wastage and
benefiting all stakeholders in a sharing economy. Almost everything has
shared value, but due to the shared value can’t be estimated and doesn’t

have payment advantage, only a few commodities own it.

In 2016, the size of sharing economy in China reached 39.45 trillion yuan,
which is a increase of 76% on a year-on-year basis. It is estimated that the

size of the sharing economy will exceed 10 trillion by 2020.

2.2 Sharing Economy’s Value

Sharing economy is broadly to assemble all distributed resources
together, share value in a centralized way, use the distributed network to
trade and exchange the resources that are not fully utilized, including
assorted profit-driven and non profit-driven goods and services. Due to the
vicious competition brought by the profit centralization in the current
sharing economy, the waste of resources induced by the gimmicks of
sharing economy model can be seen everywhere. It is not only the
bottleneck of current shared economy, but the driving force of the

revolution of blockchain.
Compared with traditional sharing economy, the application of sharing
resources can be characterized by two rights, two centralization and three
roles. The two rights are the ownership and the right to use; the two
models of centralization are decentralization and re-centralization; and the
three roles it plays are the sharer, receiver and the sharing platform itself.
In the sharing economy, the provider provides an idle resource that’s
demanded by the receiver. Sharing means the right to use is shifted
temporarily without any change to the right to ownership. Decentralization
of the sharing economy allows the resource provider to break the tradition
by approaching the receiver directly without any middleman. However,
when large amount of decentralized sharing happens, a re-centralized
platform will be required to form a sizable regulated market. All three
parties (sharer, receiver, and sharing platform) are essential for sharing
economy to work. The relationship between sharer and receiver can be,
one-to-one, many-to-one or many-to-many. Given that both the early
models of centralized and re-centralized sharing economy continues to
exhibit bottleneck characteristics in form of destructive competition; and
that the sharing economy remains incapable of pricing values, the team
believes that the sharing economy should be based on a decentralised
model to solve both issues. The sharing of WiFi can be a good use case
for the adoption of blockchain technology in the sharing economy as each
sharing WiFi unit acts as a node that allows for the data transfer. Based on
a mining algorithm, mining rewards can be programmed to automatically
distributed by the blockchain to incentivise adopters to utilise the
ecosystem. This indirectly solves the issue of pricing for a shareable
value. We believe that such use cases will be revolutionary and will bring

about positive effects to the society as a whole.
2.3 How Blockchain enhances the value of Sharing Economy

Blockchain, is also known as the distributed ledger technology, an Internet
database that is decentralized, open and transparent. It allows everyone
on the blockchain to participate in record keeping. As the smart contracts
mature, blockchain will naturally shift from the information recorder to the
trading executor. One example is low-cost automated trading, which has
greatly reduces the cost of value exchange. Combined with the
unimaginable application scenarios developed by loT, for example, the
current sharing economy is only available on products with high value.
Once the transaction cost is significantly reduced, all thing can be shred in
anyway, anytime and anywhere. With the appropriate terminal, an ideal

sharing economy will come true.

Through blockchain technology, Smartshare Protocol will build a smart,
credible, open, decentralized data exchange for a sharing economy
based on the current architecture of sharing economy. Smartshare aims to
subvert the existing centralized sharing platform with blockchain
technology, and use Smartshare Token to realize value quantification and
circulation. At the same time, as a underlying protocol of blockchain
sharing economy, Smartshare will conduct In-depth coverage and
application in related industry of business, applying blockchain technology

in new business.

3. Smartshare Achieves loT value sharing

3.1. Internet of Things Development and Current Situation

With the popularization of loT, the concept of interconnected networks is
deeply rooted in our hearts. loT utilizes information sense devices to
achieve interaction among products. In short, all your devices are

implanted in chips, making intelligent network interaction possible.

Each loT terminal can act as an independent business entity on the
network and share their ability or resources with other terminals at low
transaction cost. All loT devices are able to report their status, which
creates a good condition for us to utilize the idle resources. At the same

time, loT has also provided a transparent, fluid market for trading.

In 2015, the global loT market reached 62.4 billion U.S. dollars, an
increase of 29% over the same period of previous year. By 2018, the
global loT device market is expected to reach 103.6 billion dollars, with a
compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21% from 2013 to 2018. The
amount of new loT devices will grow from 1.691 billion units in 2015 to
3.054 billion units in 2019.

11
The rapid development of loT has appeared a few prominent issues.
Firstly, many loT infrastructures are not utilized optimally and are left idle.
Many loT vendors and investors do not benefit from the loT data and
terminals. Secondly, the global loT platform lacks a_ universal
communication mechanism, which has made data collection and cross
device connection difficult.For example, the industrial ecosystem of a
traditional PC or mobile phone consists of the foundational processing
chip, foundational software and core application. Smart hardware is based
on smart technology and has its ecosystem processing chip, data,
algorithm, development framework and application platform. The core
factors are more intercoupled and complex. For example, differences in
the hardware architecture and lack of common communication protocol
and standard has resulted in difficulty of individual terminals

communicating with each other.

Present blockchain technology not only provides the right solution for
recording data for all loT cells, but also ensures that recorded data can’t
be amended. Therefore, Smartshare is using blockchain to solve the
shortcomings of communication compatibility and resource idleness to

enhance the value of loT.

3.2 Blockchain Technology Used in loT

While there are already a lot of loT applications, current technology is
inadequate to realize ideal usage of loT in which everything is
interconnected. The current loT framework is mainly closed. Although
devices in a closed system can interconnect with each other, and even the
Internet can transfer data, there’s still difficulties for devices using different

systems to undertake valuable communication.

12
On the other hand, we need to use other loT equipment manufacturers
terminals and networks for data transmission and storage. It is thus
necessary to reach a multi-party agreement on the distribution of benefits.
In other words, companies and individuals who provide basic loT devices
and web services will be able to obtain reliable revenue more easily , such
as charging fees based on the amount of data stored and transmitted.
Under the present technical conditions, a cooperation agreement must be
reached if different loT service providers are to share resources.
Blockchain technology made point-to-point data transmission in loT
possible. A big and centralized datacenter is not required anymore for data
synchronization, management and control. Operations such as data
acquisition, instruction sending, and software update can all be

transmitted over the blockchain network.

3.3 Eco-alliance Based on Smartagent

Smartshare bridges the entire ecosystem through smart chips. Each
Smartshare smart chip implanted in a smart terminal acts as an individual
node. A Smartagent chip will be implanted in each loT terminal, then the
terminal will be registered on the blockchain and have a digital identity. On
this very note, Smartshare will use the smart contract ledger to record all
information of this digital identity. The digital identity can be used for
identity authentication, but more important, as the basis for identification in
blockchain-based loT. Its goal is to achieve the direct communication and
value delivery between objects. It will also acquire tokens automatically
according to the shared value provided by devices during the sharing

process.

14
Smartshare is committed in working with more loT vendors. It is estimated
that by end of 2018, the number of alliance manufacturers will reach 10 or

more.

3.4 Smartshare Ability for loT’s Rapid Growth

By using Smartshare, loT devices of different owners can transfer data
through encrypted SSP protocol and calculate sharing value and acquire
data through Smartagent. The fees for data transfer can be calculated by
Smartagent too. SmartToken is the basic unit in Smartshare blockchain
loT network. It will be used for payment, and as a reward for value
sharing. As long as loT vendors provide blockchain technical support for
devices, their devices would be able to share or exchange their value

within the Smartshare network.

Smartshare's vision is to create a sharing ecosystem with appropriate
sharing mechanisms and reward schemes for the sharers in order to

accelerate the growth of the sharing economy within the loT ecosystem.

15
4. Smartshare Operating Mechanism

4.1 What is Smartshare

Smartshare is a distributed network protocol that uses blockchain
technology and digital identity to digitize assets. It uses smart contracts to
transfer value to sharing entity, making all shareable objects realize the

exchange of shared value.

Through built-in encryption protocol and blockchain based Token
rewarding mechanism, Smartshare makes billions of loT terminals get
shared value and form a massive decentralized sharing network based on
the algorithm of value sharing. It will be possible to share different types of
smart terminal value, such as computing resources, network bandwidth,
network quota, storage, rights to use other devices and even time through

Smartshare protocol.

4.2 Problems solved by Smartshare

The irresistible decentralization age is only accelerated and made better
by adoption of loT. Billions of people and devices are connected by loT in
point-to-point manner, forming a massive sharing economy. loT not only
allows everyone to be both producer and consumer at the same time,
making each activity become a form of cooperation, but connects all
people into a global community. In this way, the prosperity of social capital
is unprecedented, all above conditions make the sharing economy

possible.

In the rapid growth of a sharing economy, the main issues for more

universal and in-depth improvement are as follows:

16
(1) The shared value of smart terminals is hidden due to the lack of
universal value standard and marketability, resulting in a waste of large
amount of resources.

(2) Lack of universal protocol. There has been attempt to use
blockchain to solve the pain point of current sharing economy, however
the lack of protocol between chains has resulted in the shared value
nonnegotiable.

(3) The shared value mechanism lacks flexibility. As different
participants have diverse requirements on the sharing mechanism, the

existing mechanism cannot be promoted universally.

4.3 Smartshare's Goal

Smartshare is a blockchain-based distributed database, utilizing the
features of blockchain, such as decentralization, disintermediation,
trustfree smart contract and timestamp to form the foundation of sharing
economy by establishing a smart, trustable, open, decentralized protocol

for value sharing.

Smartshare is centered on the underlying shared general protocol, and is
gradually connected with applications in sharing industry, such as shared
trip, shared charge pal, shared digital products and homestay. At the
same time, Smartshare uses loT, Al and big data to achieve the optimal
usage of efficient resources, building the top-ranking decentralized sharing

ecosphere.

17
5. Smartshare Technical Background and Program

5.1. Smartshare Agreement

Smartshare bridges the entire ecosystem through smart chips. Each
Smartshare smart chip implanted in a smart device acts as an individual
node. Through Smartshare, the nodes would be connected and be able to

exchange and share value.

Blockchain consensus is achieved through a very rigorous mechanism.
Adding the next block in the blockchain requires multiple parties to
compete and obtain block rewards or transaction fees. Bitcoin uses Proof
of Work (POW) and Hash calculations for mining. Smartshare uses an
original consensus mechanism, proof of share to ensure that mining is
achieved through sharing. This sharing mechanism is based on multiple

consensus mechanisms.

Smartshare Platform

Smartshare Chain

Smart Agent Smart Agent Smart Agent

Intelligent Terminal, Storage, WIFI. Air Purifie, Router,etc

A good use case for Smartshare is to mine by sharing computing power.
Research from Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing
(BOINC) has shown the viability of using an open protocol to reward users
who contributed computing power. BOINC is an open protocol for scientific
grid computing that allows participants to contribute their own spare
computational power to conduct a series of scientific calculations.
Smartshare uses BOINC as a computing platform to help conduct a
variety of scientific research, which includes finding identities of

individuals, simulating DNA data, etc.

Another example is mining through resources sharing(storage, bandwidth,
etc.), where the smart chip will communicate directly with the smart
terminal to monitor the shared resources, and issue appropriate amount of

tokens

5.2. ShareAgent’s Smart Chip

SmartShare bridges the entire ecosystem with ShareAgent. Each
SmartShare node has only one ShareAgent (hereinafter referred to as SA)
built on a dedicated smart chip. SA's core functions include: node
authentication, node asset management, service metering, distribution
control, service price assessment and service billing. SmartShare links
these nodes through SA to achieve the sharing and exchange of value

sharing.

19
5.2.1 Node Authentication

SA certifies the legitimacy of each node. As an authenticated security unit
of sharing network, SA has the basic legitimacy granted by the sharing
network. At the same time, SA also undertakes the task to identify the
legitimacy of electronic information devices and systems related to

corresponding nodes.

5.2.2 Node Asset Management

SA is responsible for not only playing an role of electronic wallet by
receiving, paying and storing digital currency assets, but managing other
assets owned by the nodes in the shared network. For example, data
asset information that nodes store in shared storage, and shared service

information that is currently provided to external parties.

20
5.2.3 Service Description

SA represents shared service information of sharing network provided by

nodes, including service types and service definitions.

5.2.4 Matching Transactions

SA represents the node to provide the shared network with service price,
including the supply and request price. Based on the price of both parties
and fair rules, the transaction can be coordinated in the principle of

benefiting our own.

5.2.5 Service Measurement and Distribution Control

SA cooperates with the sharing network to accurately measure the service
provided externally or received by nodes, record unsettled service metrical
information, and coordinate the progress and procedures of the service
provided or accepted by this node. For example, the process of storage
sharing service includes the coordination of data sending and

confirmation, and daily health inspection of data stored in this node.

5.2.6 Charge Settlement

SA will manage payment and fund transfer based on pre-established

smart contract for deposit, installment payment, and balance payment.

5.2.7 Example Description

SA verifies the service capability of associated storage service node, and

periodically checks for updates according to the preset rules. Provide

21
storage service to obtain digital currency, and pay digital currency when
you receive storage service. The actual turnover is calculated by the
standard of matching transactions. Data storage service is defined by
volume of data, writing speed, reading speed, layers of redundancy, etc.,
(a clearly regular framework is required). The service demander and
supplier will send out a request to the network with self-requirement and
expected price. The transaction will be matched real-time by the network.
It should be noted that each service unit is different from actual storage
tasks seen by users. For example, a user can submit a 1GB data storage
request through a node device and specifies a total bandwidth target and
4 redundant copies. After SA interacts with the shared network, it divides
the 1GB data into several data packets, indicating the specifications and
expected price for public tender. Based on the bidding rules submitted by
users (prices fluctuation principle), SA constantly seeks the best quotation
for the node owners with a profitable way. After matching a transaction for
a data packet, SA pays deposit to the service provider (if required),
obtains the information required by data transmission, and both parties
(may be multiple parties) begin to transfer data. Each node device reports
the status of data transmission to SA. After successful completion, the
demander pays the balance, and if the service fails, deposit will be
returned (if any). Make appropriate compensation according to the
established rules to(if available and as the service provider's
responsibility). Once the service is completed, and the transmission and
storage of all data packets is finished one by one. To simplify the overall
design of storage service architecture, shared storage can be built

according to object storage.

22
5.3. ShareAgent Technical Architecture

SA is built on a dedicated security chip. Its structure is as follows:

Sound networking mechanism: If the node device has sufficient
networking capabilities, SA can use the node device to connect to
the shared network. For node devices that do not have networking
capabilities, SA can also connect to the shared network through the
built-in NB-loT module.

The SA is based on a dedicated security chip designed to provide better
security, performance, power consumption, smaller form factor, and more
conducive system integration. The hardware-level trusted computing
system improves the trustworthiness level of the sharing network and

provides a reliable basis for the development of the sharing network.

SA is not only applicable to node devices that have networking
capabilities, but also to node devices or virtual service nodes that are not

connected to the Internet. The SA's built-in NB-loT not only provides the

23
basic networking capabilities required by shared network, but also makes

the diverse and innovative applications on the network possible.

6. Smartshare Application Scenarios

Smartshare will build a blockchain-based underlying communication
protocol and a massive shared network to realize the exchange of sharing
value, saving social resources such as bandwidth, storage, hotspot,
power, energy, time, etc. In Smartshare network, the reward mechanism is
based on smart contract. The Smartshare Foundation will form a shared
cooperation alliance to support various hardware and software. The
development protocol is open to to third-party development teams, and
Smartshare protocol will be applied in more scenarios. Below are some of

the settled product applications that will be implemented in Smartshare.

6.1 Traffic Sharing Application

The are currently billions of smart routers. After investing much capital, the
profit margin of flow resource is not high. The Smartshare protocol
supports different smart router to register, authenticate and transact on
Smartshare terminal. Equipment users and owners can transfer the right

of use through smart contract to achieve value transfer.

Smartshare has built a protocol layer, supporting the quick access of
common smart router, which can be upgraded to new sharing smart
hardware. And users can share the idle bandwidth, storage space and

computing power to exchange digital currency Token.

6.2 Shared computing applications

With the development and popularization of cloud computing, deep

learning and blockchain technology, the demand of computing power

25
becomes more and more urgent. More and more enterprises increase

their computing power by expanding their data centers horizontally.

In fact, there is large amount of computing power around our daily lives
that is usually wasted, which is from our personal computers, or even
smartphone. These devices are not required to perform at their peak
performance 90% time in use. If we can utilise the idle computing power, it

would be a very powerful computing resources.

Smartshare bridges the entire ecosystem through smart chips. Each
Smartshare smart chip installed on a smart device acts as a stand-alone
node. Through Smartshare, the nodes would be connected and be able to

share or exchange value.

6.3 Shared storage applications

In Information age, data storage such as local storage is no stranger to us.
Local storage refers to data physically stored in computer hard disk or
removable hard disk; However, as data stored increases, the hard disk
space will eventually be a limitation. Moreover, significant losses may be
incurred if the physical hard drive is damaged, and hence comes the birth

of professional cloud storage services.

For businesses, while cloud storage alleviates the storage pressure, it also
allows companies to be limited by third parties. Cloud storage is a
centralized service, with service provider having full control over the
server. Moreover, if the service provider terminates the contract, the stored
data is not accessible anymore. In addition, cloud storage services are

provided by professional data centers, where the cost is extremely high.

26
Even mere storage space can incur a high cost if a company needs to

store big data.

Smartshare allows all users' terminals to be part of the storage network.
This storage network has its own unique consensus mechanism and
incentive mechanism. Smartshare builds a shared network using
authorized voting verification and storage verification. The blockchain is
equivalent to the accounting system. When a file is stored, a encrypted
private key is generated and provided only to the uploader. The user can
only download the file with the right private key; the transaction generated
by the entire storage network is fueled by the digital currency,
ShareToken. Smartshare network distributes and issues tokens following
the prespecified mechanism,and users can share storage space, share

valuable documents, publish valuable documents to earn token rewards.

6.4 Smart Weather Monitoring Terminal

Smart weather monitoring device. The device has various spherical
sensors built-in, such as temperature, humidity, light, air pressure and
ultraviolet light sensors to monitor the surrounding real-time weather

conditions.

The users can start capturing image of real-time weather after purchase.
What’s more, users can share the images through various social medial,
and become the meteorologist among your friends. If you please, you'll be
able to share the real-time weather status via WeChat, WeiBo or email
very easily. The whole sharing process is simple.

This type of resource sharing is mainly driven by pure interest, where the
users spontaneously share the data obtained by the terminal. However,

due to the lack of proper reward mechanism, the frequency and breadth of

27
data sharing is fairly low, and ideal sharing is not achieved. Smartshare
plans to reach strategic cooperation with this equipment manufacturer,
and quickly access to the smart meteorological equipment terminal
through the protocol, as well as calculate the shared data value of users

through smart contract to realize returns of Tokens.

6.5 Other Scenarios

With the sustainable development of sharing economy, the sharing of
content delivery network (CDN), bandwidth, storage space, bicycle, power
bank has grew significantly during the process of decentralization to
centralization development. However, it’s only rental economy in disguise,
and is not an ideal sharing economy. To make sharing economy back to
the fully utilization of idle resources instead of rental system, decentralized
nature of blockchain is required. In this way, It can not only extend the
present sharing model to more entities and individuals, but also can be

applied in more industries and scenarios.

28
7. Mining Mechanism

7.1 How to mine

The users can mine by using devices with ShareCore chips built-in. During
the sharing process. According to shared values provided by devices,

tokens can be acquired automatically through smart contract on the chain.

7.2 Equipments compatible for mining

In order to share the idle products and ensure the fairness of mining, you

shall meet the following conditions:

* Use devices developed and manufactured by vendors cooperating
with the Smartshare Foundation
* Devices implanted with ShareCore chip

* Devices are shared as required

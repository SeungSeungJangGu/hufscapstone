1.1 Abstract

Today, 600 million people run ad blockers on their phones and desktops because they’re tired
of being abused by the advertisement industry.’ Unbeknownst to most, unwanted mobile
advertising accounts for more than $23 per month in data charges on the average user’s data
plan, and approximately 21% less daily battery life.

This relationship is not consensual; users have no say and no perceived right to avoid ads or
choose which ads they want to see in today’s climate.’ Their only choice is to opt out of the
ecosystem completely, and it is advertisers and publishers who suffer the most from this ad
blocking backlash, because this means that there are 600 million sets of eyeballs - and
therefore 600 million potential customers - who they lose out on.*

Vidy pledges to bring these 600 million lost users back into the advertisement ecosystem. Our
tri-layer solution built on the blockchain will be the win-win-win that this broken industry
needs to fairly reward all participants, augment video ad relevance, and cut out the
troublesome middlemen that have erected an opaque, fraudulent, and abusive status quo.

1.2 Synopsis

The world needs a decentralized video ad platform that can ensure a strong, steady, equitable
profit channel for publishers and advertisers, and at the same time consolidate the industry’s
fragmented work flow of middlemen, exchanges, networks, and distributors muddying up what
should be a simple handshake between an advertiser and publisher.

Vidy’s patent-pending content delivery model is one that will forever change how the internet
works. It is the new hyperlink, taking inspiration from the hyperlink's years of global adoption
and usefulness, but improving upon its stark limitations with the goal of delivering users and
publishers unparalleled convenience, utility, and simplicity with just one hold.

Vidy constructs a ledger system that measures how long a user watches an ad thanks to hold
tracking technology on its embed application layer. Vidy then rewards publishers and users
accordingly for holding on ads with VidyCoins, taken as a fraction of the VidyCoin payout made
from advertiser to publisher for that video ad impression.

In this way Vidy properly incentivizes and compensates users and publishers alike, and delivers
video ads judiciously through the world’s first NLP-powered consensus layer, while securitizing
precious user data through smart contracts.

Vidy’s mission is to empower people to find the best things in video fast, without the need
to be party to a profit-obsessed online world that treats our internet lives like tradable data

warehouses, offering us no compensation in the process. Everyone knows that the internet is
run on advertisement revenue,° and that the highest revenues come from user-relevant ads.’ °’ *°
To our detriment however, there has never been a way to escape the need to fuel these targeted
ads with invasive user data tracking that is traded, sold, made public, and exploited.’

But in 2017 the Vidy team found a way around this decades-long problem, and we’ve been
racing ever since to make our solution a reality. We believe we can allow the online ad
ecosystem to have its cake and eat it too by aligning incentives for all parties. With our answer,
people won’t need to unwillingly forfeit their privacy anymore, can rightfully be rewarded for
powering the ad industry with their attention, and ad publishers will make more money than
they do now on video ads by unlocking a whole new frontier for video ad inventory.

Vidy’s solution is an invisible layer, resting atop any web page, that embeds videos inside the
text on that page. This layer allows publishers to embed any video advertisement into the
actual words that their users are reading, without the ad needing to be ever-present on screen
taking up precious real-estate or indenting paragraphs. Essentially, Vidy is opening up the
internet to a new hidden dimension of UI for video ads to be placed through NLP embedding
behind relevant text.

This allows ad revenue to be driven for the first time by the direct relevance of the text on a
web page, in conjunction with a user’s filtered affinities on top of NLP placement. Vidy’s embed
layer will provide an order of magnitude more inventory for publishers than that of our broken
banner ad status quo, and will liberate online users from an advertiser’s vapid need to broker

invasive user-data thanks to Vidy’s smart contract data storing. Therefore it is the first win-win
the ad industry has ever seen.

As a distributed search engine that performs its queries inside video, Vidy harnesses the power
of blockchain to finally bring relevancy, transparency, security, and decentralization to
advertisements served up through its distributed video search. Thanks to the Vidy team’s
core strengths in NLP blockchain development, AI, distributed systems architecture, and web
engineering, Vidy has conceived a tri-layer solution, to be discussed later on, to execute on this
vision.

Vidy is uniquely poised to deliver on this undertaking, not just because it has already built the
technology behind this invention, but because it has already forged global partnerships with the
biggest names in media, including an exclusive partnership with Baidu in China, and deals with
dozens of other multi-million user companies. All told, Vidy has access to millions users throughout
China and the greater world thanks to its partnerships.

Vidy has also inked deals and intent-to-use statements from some of the biggest brands in the
world to debut as the first advertisers on its patent-pending embeddable layer. These advertising
partners include multi-billion dollar retailers, fortune 50 enterprises, and over a dozen
multi-national brands. This means Vidy will be revenue-positive from day one of launch, and will
deliver profits to publishers almost immediately.

2.1 Video Inventory Shortage Problems Inducing Fraud

Over 30% of advertisers and 50% of ad exchanges complain today about a deep shortage in
inventory on the web for video advertisements.'* Inventory means digital real estate where
publishers can place an advertiser’s video ad on screen for users to see. Advertisers desperately
want more of this inventory (more real estate) to show their video ads, but publishers simply
can’t keep up with the increasing demand. This is in part because publishers are already
confined to tight spaces on small screens overrun by the clutter of banner components.

This shortage in space for video ads, paired with a steadily growing demand for publishers to
find ways to accommodate, has become the catalyst of a gross imbalance in ad fraud.” Video
ads account for less than 45% of all ads on the web, yet they are the cause of more than 64% of
all advertisement fraud.”°

It is believed that advertisers lose over $16.4 billion a year in ad fraud, specifically in instances
where they pay for impressions that simply don’t exist,’’ or they pay full price for impressions
that have been manipulated by bots and other tactics. '* Google believes that only 44 per cent of
views are human, and over the next 10 years, the global cost of ad fraud is projected to rise to
$50 billion, according to the World Federation of Advertisers. '”

opportunity to create a new incremental revenue stream without cannibalizing their existing relationships.

This fraud is exacted by middlemen in the video ad industry on two main levels. The first is via
the misrepresentation of pre-roll ads whereby a distributor will mislead an advertiser about
where, when, and how their video ad appears on content pre-roll.*° And the second is via the
intentional altering of video tags in order to assign irrelevant videos to low performing
inventory through artificial tag appearance.

The Chief Brand Officer at Procter & Gamble, Marc Pritchard, sums it up well, “Better
advertising and media transparency are closely related. Why? Because better advertising
requires time and money, yet we’re all wasting way too much time and money on a media
supply chain with poor standards adoption, too many players grading their own homework, too
many hidden touches, and too many holes to allow criminals to rip us off. We have a media
supply chain that is murky at best and fraudulent at worst. We need to clean it up, and invest
the time and money we save into better advertising to drive growth.””’

Simply put, the current ad ecosystem where central parties have sole control over the
complicated and opaque brokerage of ever-changing bids, asks, and spreads is just not working
for anyone.”

2.2 Why We Hate Ads

When you consider what an advertisement tries to accomplish, it really should be a positive
and value-adding aspect of online life. Advertisements are supposed to make it convenient for
you to purchase and access the products and services that you are most likely to care about. So
why have advertisements become so broken, and so hated, and so stigmatized? The simplest
answer is that we as users have become altogether annoyed, desensitized, and abused by ads
for far too long.

Ads are annoying:

Advertisements are annoying because there is zero global standardization for how an
advertisement is required to be displayed to a user across all platforms. The result of this
fragmentation is a hodgepodge of ad styles that pop up at the worst times, a dangerous
normalcy around banner ads that convey fake premises to lure clicks, disruptive visuals

17 The Compendium of Ad Fraud Report by World Federation of Advertisers notes that ad fraud is likely to represent in excess of $50
billion by the year 2025, and that it is easy to produce scenarios where ad fraud revenues equate to $150 billion per annum in the
same time frame. https://www.wfanet.org/app/uploads/2017/04/WFA_Compendium_Of_Ad Fraud_Knowledge.pdf

18 “The amount of bot fraud in our midst is unrivaled in any other industry and is sadly leading to a crisis of confidence on the buy
side.” — Solve Media CEO, Ari Jacoby in Advertising Age.

https://www.inmarketingwetrust.com.sg/paying-ad-fraud-bots/

!° The report also notes that By 2025 the total global investment on digital media is projected to be within a range of $400 billion to
$500 billion. If just 10% of the upper limit within this range is exposed to ad fraud, this will be second only to cocaine and opiate
markets as a form of organised crime
https://www.wfanet.org/app/uploads/2017/04/WFA_Compendium Of Ad Fraud Knowledge.pdf

20 “But despite the promise of digital ads being more effective because they can target a market so precisely, the downsides include a
target reach that is totally fake or wrongly identified”.
http://www-.straitstimes.com/tech/real-promise-marred-by-bots-trickery-and-fake-ads

21 Procter & Gamble, as one of the world's highest-spending advertisers, urged the media buying and selling industry to become
transparent in the face of "crappy advertising accompanied by even crappier viewing experiences.

architected purely to disrupt mobile user experiences, and countless other tactics employed to
manipulate user sessions at the behest of target advertising profit. Ads are so annoying that
most companies, despite the need for cash to sustain themselves, today are forced to go ad-free
and therefore revenue-free in order to not bleed users who come to their product and leave
immediately due to seeing invasive ads that cannibalize the experience. The moment that a
company reaches the inflection point when they can begin showing ads without suffering
massive user loss is what we call at Vidy reaching the “annoyance tolerance level”. Sadly most
companies never reach this point.

Vidy's invisible embed layer will solve
this.

Ads are abusive:

Advertisements are abusive because they are powered by a collection of data points on
yourself, gleaned from your history, your actions, your words, your social graph, and every
definable aspect of your online life without any compensation to you for it. Companies trade
this information, sell it, share it, publicize it, and exploit it to help puppeteer your
micro-actions on the web.” Scary? Just as we are afforded the same right to privacy in the
physical world, our digital lives should be no different, especially given that we are
progressively spending more time online than offline. Yet our rights in the physical world
versus the digital world are grossly inversive. Incidentally, targeted ads also abuse us in other
unknowing ways. For one, they take a significant toll on our battery life since tracking methods
are run in the background of our devices as they operate. Moreover, they put a piece of our
monthly data allowances on hijack, since data is collected at every turn and our devices
regularly communicate with the cloud for storage and processing.”

Vidy’s smart-contract data containers will
solve this.

Ads are ineffective:

Advertisements are ineffective because as humans, we build up a ‘muscle memory’ around UI
components when we see and experience them repeatedly. A simple example of this is that we
don’t have to think about where to tap on a screen when we want to exit a view; the back
button is almost always in the top left on a navigation bar on a mobile view and we
instinctively tap there to leave. Likewise when it comes to ads, we have become grossly
desensitized to banner ads and interstitial ads given that they are so regularly, so irrelevantly,
and so disruptively displayed everywhere. The result is that most ad UI components have
grown to be ignored, to the point of a growing adverse stigmatization from brands who employ

them, and the stats speak for themselves. Banner ads are seldom tapped to the tune of 0.05%
out of 1000 impressions, and full-screen interstitials, despite hijacking your whole screen, are

° ° ° 25 ° °
only tapped 5% of times out of 1000 impressions.” This means that unless you want to entirely
derail your product’s current user experience with a full-screen interstitial ad takeover, as a
publisher you are looking at click/tap-through success rates lower than a tenth of one percent
with your exisitng advertising inventory options.

Vidy's NLP consensus-layer will solve
this.

Indeed the industry has problems abound for all parties involved. As users, we get harmed the
most, and are powerless to any recourse except the nuclear option of disconnecting from the
ad world completely with an ad blocker. Despite this broken climate that we are up against
however, with a little innovation, enhanced by the powers of blockchain, we are confident we
can fix it.

3. The Solution

Vidy is creating the first, decentralized, truly distributed,” video-ad platform for fair and
consensual advertisement consumption.

Vidy is the first platform to execute on this because of its patent-pending distribution model to
deliver video ads through NLP embeds. Vidy’s solution is an invisible layer that rests atop any
web page, allowing advertisers to embed their video ads behind the relevant text that they are
linked to.

Vidy is decentralized because it harnesses the power of blockchain to bring transparency,
security, equity, and privacy to ad distribution for all parties. It accomplishes this with its
open-source protocol for NLP-powered video advertisement distribution, driven by miners on
its consensus layer.

Vidy is truly distributed because it is not a central app, or browser, or core property requiring
users to sign-up to use it, or worse yet switch over from their current products to use it. Instead
Vidy’s embed layer was built as an SDK to live on any web page that already exists, running
silently as it containerizes user data securely via its smart contracts for private demographic
targeting.

Vidy is built upon the Ethereum blockchain because of its unparalleled track record, reliable
smart contract technology, and global following.” *’ With each transaction listed in the Vidy
ledger, advertisers and publishers will now have complete transparency for all bids, asks, holds,
payouts, coin balances, and completed placements through blockchain.

On top of the Ethereum blockchain, Vidy’s tri-layer platform is broken down as follows. The
first part of its system is its data-layer which will track and containerize data, the second part is
its consensus-layer which will distribute ads, and the third part is its application-layer which
will display ads.

Vidy’s three decentralized layers are detailed below:

a. The Data Layer
b. The Consensus Layer
c. The Application Layer

3.1 Data Layer

The data layer is the foundation of the Vidy ad distribution platform, concurrently
communicating with the application and consensus layers, and transparently maintaining all
incoming data in the immutable Vidy ledger. The data layer maintains a record of all embed
placements, hold times, VidyCoin payouts, VidyCoin staked balances, and all VidyCoin
transactions via the application layer’s one-tap purchase modal.

The data layer also warehouses a collection of user data points and containerizes them in a
secure smart contract for safe handoff to the consensus layer when miners are making a
realtime determination of where and when to place an ad.

3.1.1 The Data Layer Further Broken Down

e Smart contracts containerize user data for secure and private target marketing

¢ Memory nodes via smart contract remember user data and pre-fill in Vidy’s purchase modal

* Cookies are dropped on all publisher pages via the application layer, stored in smart contract

¢ The handshake between publisher and consensus layer occurs via smart contract as soon as a
user arrives to page, whereby the publisher hands off user data securely and consensus layer
uses the decrypted data to filter relevant advertisements to display.

* The data layer maintains the ledger of all VidyCoin balances, transactions, hold times, and
video ads currently embedded.

¢ The data from holds and skips is registered in the data layer ledger for VidyCoin payout
calculation to the user and publisher, as well as for further learning via AI on the user’s data
profile so that future ad placement can become more precise.

e This ad performance data is fed into the consensus layer and an iterative cycle of ingestion,
analysis, learning, and adjustment ensues, so the consensus layer becomes more accurate
with ad relevance.

¢ For security, the data layer is architected with only two endpoints - a publisher-facing
ingestion end-point and a consensus layer-facing delivery endpoint. No other entities can
speak directly to the data layer.

3.2 Consensus Layer

The consensus layer receives user data along with ad performance information from the data
layer and processes it as inputs in the placement-scripts that it runs. This is done in conjunction
with decrypting the smart contracts that are handed off for user-data target application.

A network of miners drive the consensus layer by running an open-source protocol that
matches the natural language of live video ads with available video ad inventory. Placements
are further customized in realtime with the decrypted user-data of a visitor so that miners can
filter matching video ads down to the most relevant corresponding video ads for that particular
user visit. In this way, the consensus layer is able to:

a. decentralize ad placement fairly and efficiently,
b. place ads based on precise NLP matching, and
c. filter matches down to inventory most relevant to a user’s interests.

This allows for one NLP-linked video ad to show up for user X, and a completely different
NLP-linked video ad to show up for user Y, on the very same publisher page, based on each of
these users’ respective preferences and containerized profiles. Miners are compensated with
VidyCoin each time they successfully place an ad, with payouts delivered in aggregate of a
pre-determined number of ad placements.

The application layer is the consumer-facing distributor of video ads across the web,
encapsulated in an SDK that can be installed with just a tap by any publisher. This SDK requires
all participating publishers to adhere to a global UI standardization via

a. the UX tied to activating an embedded video ad, and
b. the video player which tracks client-side activity on the front-end.

The application layer registers and reports all event activity back to the data layer so that the
consensus layer can make iterative improvements on NLP placements. Additionally, the
application layer provides users with a host of gesture controls to better experience a playing
embedded vidy. Users can swipe up to purchase, swipe down to save and share, and can provide
feedback and scores on all content that they interface with on the embed layer. In this way, the
application layer becomes a distributed ecosytem of its own.

On this layer, platform owners can instantly embed a tiny video into the text of their site, letting
their users hold down on that linked text to reveal supporting video for literally any line that is
printed online. Advertisements that are relevant to the content that you’re consuming can now
live within the very page that you’re on, and the power is in your hands to decide when you want
to hold down to see the video that fortifies that text statement, or when you want to simply
continue reading, thereby skipping it. This keeps users on the same page longer, thereby
increasing session time for the publisher and ultimately, profit.

3.4 How It All Works

Advertiser X signs up to Vidy, connects their crypto wallet and shows the amount of VidyCoin
that they have staked, subsequently unlocking either the Titanium, Gold, or Platinum
advertising tier. The advertiser then gets access to a dashboard where they can manage their
campaigns and upload their video advertisements. All uploaded video advertisements are
transcribed to determine the words said in them, and subsequently run through a convolutional
neural network to segment out speakers in preparation of being embedded into corresponding
text.

The advertiser then lists up to 10 keywords that embody their video advertisement, and
designates the campaign dates, preferred target demographic (if available), and how much ad
spend to allocate to its campaign. All ad spend is automatically credited from their VidyCoin
wallet balance at the end of each day. If they are a Platinum tier advertiser, they can also
designate which publishers that they prefer to advertise with, and which they prefer to avoid.
When the campaign is ready, the advertiser hits the “Go Live” button and from there the
consensus layer has access to advertiser X’s new video ads for adjudication on placement in
available publisher inventory.

On the dashboard the advertiser can adjust live campaigns, view statistics on each campaign
and individual video ad’s performance, and see analytics on users and publishers to evaluate
how they are performing and iterate copy and creative accordingly.

Publisher Y signs up to Vidy, connects their wallet and selects ‘Allow’ to share all pages on their
site with the Vidy indexer. The Vidy indexer powers the consensus layer’s matching script by
scanning for natural language on each publisher page against the keywords and transcriptions
of possible ads. Publisher Y is then prompted to enter keywords of ads that are most relevant to
their platform as a whole, as well as specific keywords relevant to each individual page they
publish with Vidy’s application layer integrated. These keywords become another input for the
consensus layer to evaluate when matching relevant ads to the natural language of a publisher
page. The publisher receives a similar dashboard to that of the advertiser where they can see
all pages indexed, all currently embedded vidys, and add and remove vidys at any time. The
dashboard will show performance statistics of each embed and allow any page to have ads
turned on or off. When user Z visits Publisher Y’s page, Publisher Y shares user Z’s demographic
information via a secure smart contract with Vidy’s consensus layer. This handoff occurs as soon
as the user reaches the site, so that the consensus layer has time to use the decrypted user data
to filter ads for placement behind the text before the user or the publisher experiences a delay
in experience. Miners driving the consensus layer then place the most relevant ads behind the
linked text that they will be activated on within that publisher’s page.

As user Z holds down on the video ad, the application layer records hold time and reports it to
the data layer’s ledger for calculation of VidyCoin payout to both the publisher and the user.
The advertiser’s VidyCoin balance is subsequently credited at the end of the day based on hold
time performance. The data layer also stores and processes data on which ads were held and
which were skipped to then pass along to Vidy’s AI engine for further user profile precision
learning.

ag
Should user Z make a one-tap purchase with VidyCoin after holding down, VidyCoin is credited
from their connected wallet, and the application layer passes user Z’s encrypted information via
to the advertiser for shipment and record. The user’s wallet address is obfuscated and never
reaches the advertiser.

4. Fracture Issues Of A Broken System

Simply put, the current advertising ecosystem where central parties have sole control over the
complicated and opaque brokerage of ever-changing bids, asks, and spreads is just not working
for anyone.

The primary consequence of a centralized industry ridden with video ad supply shortages and
rampant fraud is the host of negative externalities that ripple wherewith. These fractures all
have different victims, but their commonality rests in their analogous origin - untrustworthy
private centralism. Under each present-day problem listed below is a paragraph detailing how
Vidy solves that issue through blockchain:

4.1 No User Interface Standards

Advertisers, publishers, and users alike all complain about the messiness of ads.” When there is
no UI standardization to adhere to, parties across the ad spectrum take advantage of the policy
dearth and go rogue in their pursuit of better metrics. It is a real challenge for users to get
acclimated to an advertising landscape when a different type and style of ad is thrown at them
with no consistency. In a minefield of different aspect ratios, impression timings, and action
outcomes, it is no wonder why users today feel a universal reticence to tap, a reticence to use,
and a reticence to trust.

How Vidy solves

With Vidy’s embed layer, a global UI standard emerges for ads for the first time. On both
mobile and desktop, now advertisers have a one-size fits all model to create and upload their
creatives, and publishers don’t need to worry about a plethora of inventory sizes and specifications
that they must bend their own web page to accommodate for. Users have just one way of
viewing NLP embedded video ads and know exactly what to expect every time they see a
Vidylink on the text of a page they are reading.

4.2 Slow Page Loads

Good publishers are always obsessing over slow page loads, since the stats show that most
users are lost within the first few seconds of arriving to a new site.,, Banner ads with multiple
designated placement areas on screen are big offenders of this delay since they often carry
large asset files and long respective load times. Essentially, an ad network must process a
request for an immediately visible advertisement quickly enough to match the page load speed

28 In Why People Block Ads (and what it means for Advertisers and Marketers) by Hubspot Research, “The most frustrating experience for
online browsers involve full page pop-up adverts that require the user to find an “X” to remove. More generally, 91% of respondents
agree ads are more intrusive today compared to two to three years ago, and 87% agree there are more ads in general. 79% also feel
that they're being tracked as a result of retargeted ads”
https://research.hubspot.com/why-people-block-ads-and-what-it-means-for-marketers-and-advertisers

a
of the publisher site itself, which is often just textual content and which therefore usually loads
in immediately. When you add more than just one image to this request, for a page loading
multiple banner ad placements on screen for instance, it can be a great challenge for an ad
network to match the necessary page load speeds that publishers demand. The result is that a
user sees nothing on screen for seconds on end, and in the digital world, waiting seconds is far
too long.

How Vidy solves

Vidy’s invention has no requirement to immediately load visible banner ads into open spaces on
an integrated publisher page. Instead, all of Vidy’s video ads are pre-loaded behind the text of
the page as Vidylinks, and therefore beyond the field of view of the visitor. This allows Vidy to
employ measures such as smart caching strategies, and anticipatory queue downloading as a
user scrolls on the page. Slow page loads are one less thing publishers need to worry about for
their digital experience with Vidy.

4.3 Irrelevant Ads

Over 45% of internet users who have left the ad ecosystem by installing an ad blocker,
explicitly cite that they installed that blocker because the video ads that they were seeing were
not relevant enough for them.*’ This means that in this digital age, serving up irrelevant content is
as damaging as serving sub-par content. The name of the game for advertisers who want to see
the best conversions on their campaigns, and for publishers who want to reap the most profits
on their advertising inventory, is to make ads as relevant as possible for their respective
audiences. As such, ad networks and exchanges track, harvest, trade, and sell as much user data
as possible in order to facilitate greater placement relevance. But as the ad blocker stats clearly
demonstrate, the ad market is still greatly lacking the necessary relevance to keep people
participating. Ad networks’ answer to this is saying, “Don’t worry, we just need more user data.
We need more aggressive user tracking, we need further freedoms afforded to us for selling this
data, and we need continued cross-party sharing of private user profiling through our insecure
data management platforms.” Vidy’s answer to this is saying, “it’s time for a different
approach.”**

29 A report by Google,The need for mobile speed: How Latency Impacts Publisher revenue, notes that 53% of mobile website visitors
abandon sites that take longer than three seconds to load.
https://www.doubleclickbygoogle.com/articles/mobile-speed-matters/

30 Research done by Hubspot by asking users why they installed ad blockers noted as follow: 64% said ads were annoying and intrusive,
54% said ads were disruptive, 39% said ads create security concerns while 36% said their major concern was that ads affect load time
and bandwidth usage
https://research.hubspot.com/why-people-block-ads-and-what-it-means-for-marketers-and-advertisers

31 A report by The Observer notes that “Companies like Google and Facebook use cookies to track users across multiple websites over an
undisclosed amount of time. When a person clicks on one site and then moves on to another, the cookie embedded in the first site keeps
track of that user’s searches, thereby building up a repository of information over time”

How Vidy solves

Vidy employs a purist approach to the distribution of video ads, letting natural language
protocols determine all contextual matches that it makes. The consensus layer then integrates a
decrypted smart contract of each visiting user’s profile data to determine which videos from the
NLP-designated set of matches are the most relevant for that user on that page. By
containerizing all user data in smart contracts, Vidy safeguards and validates user information
and ensures that user profiles can never leak to a third party, and can never be sold via the
platform’s data layer. With a system of checks and balances like this, communication between
an advertiser and publisher is secure and precise not because some company in the middle tells
us so, but because we know it to be so through trust-less decentralization.

4.4 Banner Ad Stigmatization

After years of being click-baited, the internet community has collectively wised up and now
primarily abstains from succumbing to the tricks of banner ads. Banner ads today are tapped
about 0.02% of the time out of 1000 impressions.” After all, you don’t know what you'll see or
where you'll go when you tap a banner ad. Some ads end your session immediately and open
up apps, some redirect you to other sites with long page-load waiting times, some try to phish
or install packages on their landing site, some deliver disruptive pop ups on each click. As
James Green of AdAge says, “For a long time, advertising has been annoying. The first
generation of ad-tech firms only made things worse by overflowing the web with too many ads,
not-so-great targeting, and overall disruptive experiences. People don't want creepy ads
following them around, especially for a product they've already bought or that they don't care
about. Now people are blocking ads, and publishers are feeling the pain. So, we shouldn't be so
shocked to hear that they are eschewing ad-tech firms since we are partially to blame for the
fact that people dislike advertising.” Advertisers suffer with this stigma, originating from the
earliest days of the internet when malevolent advertisers actually did regularly bait, phish,
steal, and inject viruses. But decades later this display format has largely been left unchanged,
and click-through performance metrics have steadily declined.

a
How Vidy solves

With Vidylinks, users get to choose what they want to hold down and watch, and what they
want to skip as they consume the content on a page. By empowering people to choose, yet
incentivizing them financially to hold down on what they are interested in, Vidy can capture
the hearts of users who otherwise do not trust advertisers anymore. Users can now rest assured
that there is a decentralized buffer operating between the advertiser and publisher via the
embed layer, thereby ensuring that their hold will always deliver a video in the same format,
UX, and appearance that they expect. When you trust something, you have a greater proclivity
to use it more.

4.5 Lost Users Via Purchase Funnels

Advertisers spend billions of dollars a year optimizing their purchase funnel to maximize the
chances that a visit becomes a purchase in the same session. Advertisers lose web visitors at
every step of a purchase funnel flow, just like a new app loses users at every stage of a sign-up
flow.” With each additional step, every extra button and actionable image, every further
requirement and box to fill in, the chances of that user successfully completing the purchase
declines. When you land on a website after tapping an ad and waiting for the new page to
load, even if that website is highly optimized and you are presented with a purchase page
immediately, there are so many online distractions and external pulls that can derail your
purchase that it is likely you often do not proceed with it.

This is a big reason why on average less than 2.2% of online visits to a retailer site from an
advertisement end in a successful purchase.*° This is a battle that an advertiser needs to keep
on fighting with or without a Vidy integration, since they will always get direct traffic to their

site that they need to optimize their funnel for. But for inbound traffic via ad clicks, this is
something that Vidy can help with to augment successful sales pre-site visit.

How Vidy solves

Vidy completely circumvents this entire purchase funnel that happens on the advertiser
website, and instead brings the purchase right to the forefront of the embed layer where the
user is watching the video ad. By flipping the purchase flow on its head, Vidy is able to greatly
simplify the checkout process. The one-tap purchase modal appears after a user holds down on
a video ad for at least 3 seconds, at which time the application layer determines this to signal a
user’s intent to learn more and potentially execute an end action. End actions that can be
displayed by advertisers include the option to purchase or the option to reserve in one-tap,
with VidyCoin or other payment methods. From there, any necessary information for shipping
and data registry is securely handed off to the advertiser from the data-layer that has write
access to the advertiser’s control dashboard, and the transaction is entered into the ledger. The
one-tap purchase modal is available only to advertisers who are in the Platinum Advertising
Tier, for which there will be a worldwide cap for the number of brands that can have access to
this feature on the embed layer.

a
4.6 Monopolies Threatening The Free Market

Monopolies and oligopolies are the direct antagonists to a free and capitalistic society where all
businesses have equal opportunities to grow. Anti-trust laws exist in America and in most
countries to safeguard the free market and ensure that competition thrives for this very reason.
But since the dawn of the internet and spanning the last 20 years, a troubling paradigm has
emerged - every valuable piece of information tied to our digital lives is now owned and stored
by just a few private companies. With this information, these companies wield unprecedented
power over us, and are themselves confronted with an almost nonexistent threat of competition. When
competition dissipates in industries as integral to our lives as big data, social, and advertising,
life becomes perilous for the mass consumers whose lives depend on those services. One of the
most important points of blockchain is to take the power out of the hands of a few and place it
back into the hands of the many where it belongs. Yet today, 73% of all ads come from just two
players, Google and Facebook. And last year a whopping 99% of all ad growth came from just
two players, Google and Facebook.” This is clearly not a level playing field, and market
ownership at these levels is good for no one.

How Vidy solves

Vidy is by its very DNA a decentralized platform where market placement decisions always rest
in the hands of the many. Vidy’s consensus layer is driven by miners with direct financial
incentive to place ads judiciously through Vidy’s NLP open source protocol. This cuts into the
current climate’s grip on the market, since centralized distributors like Google and Facebook
will now have direct pricing competition against a decentralized network where all parties are
financially aligned. Vidy’s blockchain ecosystem eliminates all risk that a single monopoly can
change internal policy, and thereby change our lives, to their fiscal benefit and to our collective
detriment.

4.7 Poorly Paired Ad Content With Inventory

Youtube and Facebook’s biggest problem in the ad space today comes from an industry-wide
complaint from advertisers about their video ads being placed near inappropriate ad inventory
on their platforms. The last thing that Coca Cola wants is its advertising dollars going to the
assignment of its digital ads on publisher content related to terrorism for example. To answer
this call to action, Youtube has pledged thousands of workers throughout Asia to solve this with
manual cleaning and prevention. Facebook likewise has pledged a significant annual budget
allocation toward the mitigation of politically charged and socially taboo content pairing with
video advertisements.* But obviously these measures are not scalable, sustainable, or
all-encompassing enough to solve the issue.

33 Across all ad formats and placements ad CTR is just 0.05%
https://www.smartinsights.com/internet-advertising/internet-advertising-analytics/display-advertising-clickthrough-rates/

a
How Vidy solves

Vidy indexes, analyzes, matches, and distributes based on a wide array of natural language
data points across the ad buying spectrum to determine the proper placement of an ad ina
completely scalable and automated fashion. With this natural-language tethered approach,
there is no need to hire an army of content curators, quality assurance professionals, or video
flaggers to determine what content is appropriate for pairing. Vidy considers the following
information when making a placement decision:

the transcription of the uploaded video ad

the video ad keywords manually entered by the advertiser

the community-vetted advertiser umbrella keywords to determine context congruence
the inventory page keywords manually entered by the publisher

the whole publisher page to determine the veracity and relevance of the publisher’s
keywords against the greater content of the writing on the page itself

a

Through these measures, Vidy ensures that there is a public protocol around assigning video
ads to available inventory based purely on the natural language relevance of that fit, thereby
ensuring that its video ads are either in contextually relevant and appropriate places, or they
are not placed at all.

5.1 The One-Tap Purchase Modal (OTP)

Vidy is moving the most important action a user can take - the purchase - to the forefront of the
web experience through its single-page embed layer. With just one tap, a user can now
purchase a product, reserve a table, or have an item delivered, after holding down on an
embedded video ad.

Advertisers and brands spend billions of dollars a year trying to optimize for the highest
conversions on their purchase funnels once a user arrives to their site from an ad. As an
advertiser, the battle to get people to tap your advertisement is just the very beginning for your
metrics mandate. You always want a successful action to close out the loop. Rather than risk
losing users from distracting product lists, confusing button UI, tiring customization flows,
troublesome payment pages, and a host of other fail-points that derail checkouts after arriving
on a site, you can now execute your purchase or reservation right from the publisher page. Vidy
then encrypts the transaction, enters it into the ledger, and sends only the user information
needed to make the shipment or registry happen on your end - all accessible through your
control dashboard.

How it works is simple, if you are a Platinum VidyCoin stakeholder, you will see the option to
run a Platinum ad campaign from your dashboard. On all Platinum ads, there is a purchase
button that appears on the embed layer next to the video as a user holds down. The purchase
button only appears after 3 seconds of hold time so that a) primary focus is given to the start of
the video ad, and b) the application layer can test if a user demonstrates enough interest to
learn more and potentially execute an end action. Upon the purchase button animating in, the
user can then pay instantly with VidyCoin, along with other checkout options like WePay,
AliPay, PayPal, and credit card. All VidyCoins that have been earned by holding down on
embedded vidys can be accessed by the user at this time and used to pay for the purchase with
one tap.

The price of the purchase is shown as both a VidyCoin calculation and local fiat currency
amount, taken as a realtime market price conversion against VidyCoin. If the purchase is made
with VidyCoin, the VidyCoin is instantly deducted from the purchasing user’s account and the
advertiser receives payment in seconds.

Vidy’s one-tap purchase modal was also built to equip the flow with up to 2 variable buttons to
designate purchase specifics, when an advertiser needs them for checkout. For example, a Nike
shoes ad could have a user select their size right from the embed layer and then hit Pay.
Likewise, a Hilton resorts ad could have a user select their room type and date of stay before
hitting Reserve.

Users who are not yet in the Vidy ecosystem will see vidylinks across the web and will be able
to fully interact with them and hold them. But if they want to start redeeming VidyCoins that
they earn from holding, or if they try to make a one-tap purchase, they will be prompted to
sign-up. Once authenticated, VidyCoin earnings are automatically credited to their Vidy
account. After a user’s first successful purchase, Vidy locks their shipping data into a smart

a
contract and pre-fills shipping details the next time that authenticated user executes a one-tap
purchase.

Vidy conducted a quick and dirty study examining the purchase pages of over 60 major online
retailers, and found that less than 7% of all sites, on a randomly chosen product item from the
home page, displayed more than 2 configurable variable requirements before allowing it to be
added to cart. With the majority of online product customizations being that straightforward,
this told us that the entire purchase flow could be expedited, simplified, and entirely housed on
the same layer that a user learns about that product from.

The one-tap purchase feature is only accessible for Platinum VidyCoin stakeholders, for which
advertisers need to own and stake 1 million VidyCoins to gain access to. With a total available
pool of 10 billion VidyCoins to be issued, this means that there can only be a max of 10,000
companies worldwide at any single time who can have access to the feature. There are over
115 million companies worldwide, all of whom need to advertise to grow their business, but
<0.01% of them can offer one-tap purchases through the Vidy platform.

Vidy is restricting access to its one-tap purchase modal for two reasons. The first is that Vidy’s
biggest focus for the future is in bringing tremendous value to the utility of its coin for the good
of the platform and for early believers in its long term potential. Vidy wants to engender an
ecosystem that becomes more and more useful and efficient to participating agents as more
companies learn about Vidy and adopt Vidy. The second reason to restrict access to this feature
is because Vidy wants to build and grow a roster of the strongest and most value-adding brands
worldwide who adopt Vidy's embed layer to give their users truly remarkable experiences.
Whether you are an ambitious start-up or a multi-national retailer, if you believe in Vidy and
stake it early, you will have access to this defining feature. Having the free market determine
who can revolutionize how people buy things online and who cannot by a first come first
served basis seems like the fairest policy for VIDY coinholders, publishers, and interested
advertisers alike.

5.2 Detecting Bot Fraud

Vidy’s application layer runs proprietary bot tracking algorithms in the background that analyze
the movements and actions of millions of users to determine usage patterns and map out
typical user behavior routes. Using deep learning, Vidy’s neural networks learn how a human,
and conversely how a bot, interacts with its video ads through Vidy’s signature hold gesture
and through other micro-movements on screen. It then automatically deducts hold times via
the data layer’s open-source fraud detection script when it flags a discrepancy between a
human user and a bot user.

Vidy evaluates over two dozen data points from simple feedback like hold times, hold
positioning, video spacing, scrolling, ancillary movement, hold surface area, screen location
area, gesture consistency, user profile background, and prolonged session activity; right
through to more advanced user profiling analysis like macro actions, extended gesture behavior
across whole pages, and sustained usage patterns across time.

All of this information is locked in smart contracts so it remains secure, and inaccessible to any

third-party entity or person. Only the Vidy data layer, which makes a realtime determination of
whether the data returning from the application layer is a real hold or fake hold, maintains it
and executes on it.

When Vidy believes a hold entry currently queued up to be added to the ledger by the data
layer has been manipulated by bots, a VidyCoin payout is still released to the publisher, but a
“marked for review” entry is added into the ledger so that the publisher can see the notice
through their control dashboard, monitor the frequency of these alerts, and respond to them to
dispute them. Once a publisher account passes the acceptable threshold of “marked for review”
counts, which is a ratio set respective to all other publishers on the platform, the publisher is
removed from the system. Upon publisher removal, all current embed campaigns on the
publisher’s site are terminated, and the publisher is prompted to transfer their accumulated
VidyCoin to another wallet. VidyCoin payouts that have already been distributed out to a
publisher, even for hold entries believed to be bot enhanced, are never recouped. Instead the
publisher is banned from the platform.

Puentes of Rebel AI aptly pushes back on the feasibility of conducting fraud checks in realtime
(pre-payout) given blockchain’s speed bottlenecks, “Compared to the millisecond response
times required to return an ad, the blockchain is just too slow to be a tool for real-time fraud
prevention and validation.”*’ This is why Vidy uses a delayed reconciliation strategy to
continually refine its pool of participating publishers to be A-players with repeated iteration
after payout.

In this way, Vidy facilitates a transparent ecosystem of decentralized monitoring, and can catch
tactical bots trying to steal from advertisers, while effectively mitigating their potential fiscal
damage by removing all long-term impact from the ledger. As more users interact with the
embed layer, Vidy’s AI keeps learning and getting stronger at identifying bot activity. The data
layer’s open source fraud-detection script that is used to detect malicious activity is regularly
updated based on Vidy’s AI versioning improvements.

5.3 A Perpetually Free Product

Tucking Vidy’s ad distribution platform aside for a moment, it is important to underscore that
Vidy offers a flagship non-revenue driving product alongside its ad system to round out the full
breadth of use cases for the ‘embeddable vidy’. This section spotlights Vidy’s core product
offering, and details exactly how it affects publishers who don't want to advertise.

At its foundation, Vidy has built a platform that lets publishers embed any video they want
behind the text of their page, not just video ads. These videos span all topics, all sources, all
formats, and all contexts. On a topical level, they range from news, speeches, trailers, and
interviews, right through to entertainment, event recaps, sports highlights, and educational
lessons.

Any publisher with a website or mobile app can opt into the Vidy ecosystem for free, and use
Vidy’s embed layer without the need to connect ads. Publishers have access to the full gamut of
product features, including Vidy’s NLP search, SDK embed layer, Vidylinks consumer-facing UI,
the Vidy uploader which lets publishers make their own vidys in seconds, and of course Vidy’s
database of millions of highlight clips that grows daily thanks to its community and curators. In
offering this complete package to publishers with no contract, lock-in, or demand to advertise,
Vidy introduces the market to its core offering and lets publishers get acclimated to the control
dashboard and to the power of Vidy’s embed feature-set with no strings attached. Then when a
publisher who uses Vidy’s embed layer wants to augment their revenue stream with video
advertising, they can just tap “Turn Ads On” in the dashboard and immediately have
NLP-powered video ads embedded in their site pages.

There is no advertisement SDK in the world that offers this type of free value to publishers,
whether they choose to advertise or not. Vidy wants to change the online landscape with
valuable video embeds first and foremost, and believes that strong ad revenues will follow suit
if users are happy first, and if their online experiences are regularly embellished with great
embedded video content from top publishers.

5.4 Tactical Mobile Indexing

With user session times and user attention progressively moving further toward mobile from
web, the advertising industry’s respective revenue split between mobile and web is
progressively following suit.

This means that it is imperative for a video ad distribution platform with aspirations of being
the ubiquitous favorite through blanket convenience for publishers, to be able to run and live
on mobile apps just the same as it can on web pages. In order to do this however, the platform
would need to be able to scrape and index mobile app pages, and that is no easy feat with
existing processes and mobile development infrastructure. Unlike web pages which can be
crawled and indexed offline for contextual advertising, the content that is shown on mobile
apps is often generated dynamically or lives in the binary file itself, and therefore cannot be
regularly accessed and scraped.

Vidy’s solution is to crawl partner publisher apps at runtime, extracting keywords and feeding
them to the consensus layer for realtime placement of relevant video ads. Vidy stays cognizant
of the overhead involved with a runtime scrape method and employs cost saving provisions so
that economical and functional efficiency is ensured.

On iOS there are 4 locations for adding and editing text, and therefore 4 methods that the SDK
focuses on, beyond of course text on buttons. There is the input view, the web view, the text
view, and the label. With the Vidy iOS SDK, mobile app publishers can make all 4 areas
readable to the Vidy platform for automatic vidy embedding. Android has a similar breakdown
of text display areas with respective OS-specific terms for each.

The Vidy mobile team is currently building a native iOS and native Android SDK counterpart to
that of its Web SDK to be run on mobile apps. The mobile SDKs will go live at runtime,
analyzing all of the available pages of text throughout all partner app views, and combining
NLP matches with the visiting mobile user’s data to embed relevant vidys on the pages that
they are viewing.

5.5 Crowdsourcing a Video Map of the Web

As a consumer-facing embodiment of the greater network, the Vidy team will be deploying a
Chrome extension for all Vidy users who want to see and interact with vidys on any website,
whether that site is a partner publisher or not within the Vidy ecosystem.

We know that the future of Vidy will be powered and dictated by our users, especially as the
platform’s features evolve to specifically serve their needs and wants. The Chrome extension is
our way of giving users a conduit for them to leave their signature on all digital territory across
the web, and what we hope will be a catalyst for bringing non-participating publishers into the
Vidy orbit by virtue of people interfacing with publisher sites before they even come to know
what Vidy is.

With the Chrome app, users will be able to both publicly and privately embed a vidy into the
text of any site that they navigate to, and will receive attribution via their own user profile for
public embeds that they make across the web. Users will be able to see all public embeds made
for any specific portion of text, and in the future will be able to interact with other users’
embeds with comments, likes, and other actions.

The Chrome app will therefore be a way to crowdsource the most fitting vidys into publisher
pages before publishers do it themselves, and publishers will have access to this video map
through their control dashboard so that they can take inspiration and ideas from the creativity
of the Vidy community.

Vidy users who run the Chrome app daily, will receive 1.5x the amount of VidyCoin payout for

each second of hold time that they accumulate. Users who don’t run the chrome app will have
their experience unaffected, but they will lose out on 1.5X earnings gains on all hold payouts.

a
5.6 The Embed Layer’s Social Future

Vidy’s embed layer has immense potential to be a driver for social connectivity and networking
within the fabric of advertising, e-commerce, and entertainment on the web. It operates at the

intersection of likeminded people sharing the same interests, visiting the same sites, and seeing
the same embedded videos; and those commonalities forge unique bonds of shared experience.

By empowering users with a voice to air questions, post comments, give praise, and write
reviews next to embedded vidys and purchase modals on the embed layer, a sort of
crowdsourced intelligence emerges on the platform to help people make better informed
choices on products and services, and feel more connected to each other as they navigate
publisher pages. Users could filter comments based on private networks of friends or the
general public, and could always control their privacy.

Advertisers could get a direct window into what their greater audience thinks about their video
advertisement and their product, and could learn and iterate from those free insights.
Publishers would get to gauge levels of macro activity and verbal sentiment around video ads
that are being embedded into their content, as well as examine the topical relevance between
their content and the corresponding advertiser’s embeds through the feedback of their
audience who interacts with it.

Facebook and Twitter both see significant traffic on conversations and comments stemming
from product and service advertisements, and Vidy’s embed layer could be the first distributed
version of this.

Vidy has a strong lean toward social media proclivities given that it was formed initially around
social use-cases, and the core product is an effective augmenter for messaging and social
consumer experiences. With a social aspect to the layer, users can connect to each other, video
ads can be community-vetted, and advertisers and publishers can capitalize on a realtime pulse
on interaction.

6.1 The Only Viable Blockchain Play For Ads

There are some great advertisement blockchain projects on the market today that have
proposed decentralized replacements to the broken ad landscape. *°*' Despite having great
concepts however, the reality is that blockchain has a significant technical limitation for present
day production-level advertising integration - loading time. Right now it just takes far too long
to process an ad request through blockchain, particularly when juxtaposed with today’s near
instant page load speeds and short-wired user attention brackets. Blockchain response times
average up to 30 seconds for a distributed consensus layer to agree upon the placement of an
advertisement in a banner space, and this makes it prohibitively slow for a blockchain to load
ads on any web page currently live today. Manny Puentes, CEO of Rebel AI and a regular writer
on the industry identifies with this issue all too well. He ascertains, “due to its distributed
nature, where transactions are verified by miners around the world, blockchain technology
simply can’t analyze or process real-time advertising transactions fast enough. Current
confirmation times for a transaction to be validated and added to the public ledger range
between 10 and 30 seconds.””

In a consensus-driven ecosystem where speed is both precedented and limited by network
reliability, delays this high will unfortunately keep blockchain projects irrelevant in the ad

space indefinitely. A distributed platform is only as strong as its weakest link, so even a network
of miners with top level hardware and internet speeds will always be held back by the slowest
link in the chain. As Puentes further points out, “the scale and speed that programmatic
advertising requires means that blockchain-based platforms are still years away.” ** Indeed, until
this limitation is overcome, any ad-based blockchain project is rendered a revolutionary dream
rather than an executable reality.

Vidy is also hampered by this same blockchain speed bottleneck.** However, by its very design,
Vidy maneuvers around it organically by pre-loading assets behind text instead of in plain view
where delays are immediately apparent to a user and therefore unacceptable for a publisher.
Essentially, if Vidy were to load in a banner ad via its consensus layer, users would have to wait
10-30 seconds to see it load in, and that would be unacceptable. But Vidy does not have to load
in a banner ad instantly; instead it pre-loads in video ads behind the text of a page, beyond the
field of view for a user when they first arrive to a page, so there is no apparent wait time to
consume content. In this way, Vidy’s blockchain solution can be integrated on publisher pages
immediately on rollout without needing to wait for a performance solution to this
industry-wide blockchain problem.

6.2 How Vidy Will Tackle Scalability

Blockchains are notoroiously hard to scale. Presently, public permission-less blockchains are
restricted with regard to the number of transactions per second that they can achieve, with this
number being fixed at a low point. Ethereum typically maxes out at around 10 transactions per
second.* Some fixes have been introduced, like elevating the top-end speed of processing
performed per block by a constant factor, but these are only short-term resolutions, meaning
that with the current exponential increase of worldwode Ethereum’s adoption, we will soon
again end up back at square one. The Raiden network, based on payment channel technology,
is unique in that it is able to scale along with the number of its increasing users, therefore
being an optimum payment solution; This means that as the Raiden Network increases in size,
so does its processing capability, with essentially no ceiling.” The Vidy system will utilize
Ethereum mainnet and the Raiden network to establish a direct channel of VidyCoin transfer
payouts among all three parties.

Key Features of the Raiden Network

The Raiden network has been successfully released to the Ethereum testnet as of September
2017 and hopes to deliver 1M transfers per second (TPS) via “state channels,” thereby
eliminating the current scalability issues in most blockchain applications.” “ Per the Raiden
website: “the basic idea is to switch from a model where all transactions hit the shared ledger on
the blockchain (which is the bottleneck) to a model where users can privately exchange
messages which sign the transfer of value”.” The Raiden network offers the following benefits

which are complementary to the core business logic of the Vidy ecosystem:

¢ The network scales linearly with the number of participants. It is expected that the network
will facilitate 1 million or more transfer per second, suitable for the Vidy platform that
needs to programmatically place ads in realtime and deliver corresponding VidyCoin
payouts.

e Transfers are confirmed within a sub-second, ensuring reliability to traders.

e Individual transfers that do not show up in the global shared ledger, ensuring
confidentiality.

e Transfer fees are orders of magnitude lower.

e Low transaction fees enable micropayment processing.

All transactions in the Raiden system are carried out by using the processing power of
operations. The size of commissions depends on the same indicator and this allows
transactions to be optimized for the transfer of medium and large amounts of cryptocurrency,

45 The selling points of Ethereum's are its blockchain and enterprise clients. Ethereum can process almost three times as many transactions
per second as bitcoin can. Not only are these transactions processed more quickly, but they're also cheaper.

7. Why Users Will Hold Down

Vidy wants to build the most addictive and compelling experience possible with its embed
layer’s hold properties. When users see a vidylink, we want them to be pulled to it, curious to
see what’s underneath, and always feeling great when they hold down. With the construction
and user experience of the layer now in perspective from previous sections, here are the
fundamental reasons why users will hold on vidys as much as possible.

a. To earn VidyCoin

b. To purchase with one tap

c. To watch an interesting video
d. To see a good ad

7.1 To Earn VidyCoin

Users will do it for the cash. Until now, as users we have received no due compensation in
return for making advertisers, publishers, and the bevy of intermediaries in between them, rich.
But with Vidy that is all going to change. Every time you hold, you earn. As you hold down on
an embedded vidy, you are steadily earning VidyCoin, calculated on a hold time basis.

Users can now collect VidyCoin based on their respective activity and repeat engagement on
the embed layer. Hold times offer a transparent metric for success, and make it brutally simple
for users to be rewarded with their attention and action. The embed layer was carefully
architected and designed to cultivate an elegant, sleek, and gamified experience for users to
track how much VidyCoin they are earning mid-hold.

7.2 To Purchase With One Tap

Vidy’s OTP is the fastest and easiest way to make a purchase or reservation on the web. Within
a mere few seconds, a user can identify an interesting topic in text, hold down to see it
displayed in video, and then tap to have it purchased and shipped to them. Doing this lands
them right back on the same page they were on a few seconds before, as if they never even left.

This is browser agnostic, this is hardware agnostic, this is publisher agnostic, this is language
agnostic, and this is territory agnostic. There has never been a distributed facilitator of
e-commerce that is both so universally accessible to all purchasing internet users, and yet so
easy for all three fiscally-involved parties to respectively adopt, with zero switching costs
required to use.

7.3 To Watch An Interesting Vidy

When we first created Vidy, we made it not to be an ad-first platform, but to be a social
platform. As such, the product was designed, incubated, and tailored to be fun, exciting, and

a
interesting to users of all demographics looking for a daily dose of digital entertainment. We
expect that on our initial rollout, far more publishers will start with an ad-free experience as
they get accustomed to the Vidy embed layer, and all that the control dashboard and its suite of
features has to offer. Then as Vidy becomes a part of their trusted daily publishing routine, they
will reach for the ads integration that can magnify their revenues. This anticipated course will
translate into great experiences for users who are reading a publisher page, or consuming the
content on a publisher app, as they will have a plethora of entertaining vidys that have been
thoughtfully embedded by top notch publishers.

How many times have you wanted to watch the video associated with a quote, statement, or
scene that you just read about? Think about how much time it takes to go find it and how
much of a hassle it is to stop and start sessions on different browser pages and websites to get
to it. Through entertainment-first embeddable vidys, integrated both via Vidy’s database of
millions of clips and through the on-demand Vidy uploader, you can enjoy that experience on a
publisher page right from the quote itself. It is on-demand entertainment delivered on touch
with a relevance to what you're reading.

On the embed layer, users can also swipe up to share a vidy that they like and want to send to a
friend. Every video share respects the aspect ratio and visual treatments of the embedded video
itself, so a friend could receive anything from a typical landscape video right through to a
segmented out body with holo effect in a text message or on a social post. The share feature
gives friends the opportunity to join in the fun, and get that same laugh you did, or learn
something that you found interesting as well. Vidy hunters will start getting credit for great
‘vidy finds’ across the web that they share, just like Youtube video sharers and Instagram meme
hunters do. In the future, Vidy may incentivize sharing with a 1.2x earning multiple on all
VidyCoin payouts for users who reach a daily threshold of vidy shares.

7.4 To See A Good Ad

Good ads are great. Bad ads are terrible. When you see a good ad, you remember it and you
appreciate it. That’s why Vidy is built on two premises of advertisement scarcity. The first is a
cap to its total pool of available coin, with the requirement that advertisers stake enough VIDY
to participate in its membership tiers and access its advertising features. This allows the natural
forces of demand and supply to decide permitted companies from non-permitted ones.
Constraints have always driven both people and companies to great creative achievement, and
we believe feature scarcity will be no different here.

The second is Vidy’s built-in performance cleanse protocol, where bad ads with short hold
times are regularly flagged by the data layer for advertisers to edit and replace, and are
gradually phased out from the internal consensus of placements. A poorly performing ad will
a) spur a notification to that advertiser, and b) start to dissipate from request pools for the
consensus layer to place. All advertisers with consistently low hold counts get notified in their
dashboard and are given community tips on how to improve with the future video ads that
they upload to the system.

8. A Win-Win-Win For The Industry

Whether you are a user, a publisher, or an advertiser, you are looking for positive change in the
current climate after being taken advantage of for years. This is why we call this fresh new
paradigm of decentralized video advertising a win-win-win for all parties involved.

8.1 Win For The User

As a user you want the best possible experience while expending the smallest amount of effort
to get that experience. This means that when possible, having a feature-robust application is
preferred because for convenience sake, if everything is on one page or on one site there is no
time cost involved in switching to another site. Facebook and WeChat are prime examples of
this concept, having each enjoyed great successes with their respective session times.

Picture yourself reading a Wikipedia page about Martin Luther King Jr. and learning about his ‘T
Have a Dream’ speech that he delivered in 1963. You’re intrigued and want to see some actual
footage rather than just reading about it. Until now, you would have to google the speech to
find the video for it, thereby leaving Wikipedia entirely and ending your experience on that
page. Your path would likely begin with a google search, and upon seeing results you would
likely be directed to Youtube where you would then either further refine your search to get to
the right video, or watch the video straight from the Youtube landing page. At this point
however, your expected route becomes hazy. You may stay on Youtube if another video catches
your eye, you may go back to Wikipedia to finish reading the page, or you may replicate this
flow ad infinitum if again you want to see something that is not quick to find on the Youtube
platform. This type of constant switching builds up an ever-growing cognitive overload, and it
is one of the things internet users cite as one of the biggest pain points for their online
experiences.

If Wikipedia had that footage embedded within the text of the speech name as it appeared in
the paragraph the reader first read about it in, then Wikipedia would never have lost that user
in the first place. Instead that user would now have the added dimension of video support for
all of the interesting things they come across on Wikipedia, and as a result Wikipedia’s session
time would grow dramatically since the session is maintained contiguously.

ag
Now picture yourself reading a Washington Post article that is covering Trump’s response to the
Charlottesville rally. As the Washington Post covers Trump’s actions and responses, they begin
to quote him and you think to yourself, how cool would it be if I could actually watch him
saying that right here. You could see his delivery, hear his tone, understand the context around
his statement, and on the simplest of levels merely confirm that he actually did in fact say what
was quoted. It would be the end of fake news as we know it! But alas, unless the article has
posted that video between paragraphs, which seems rarer than being struck by lightning these
days, your only recourse is to scour the web on other websites, leaving your article to find the
correct video of him. From there you'll be confronted by a 40 minute speech; how will you ever
find the exact moment when he makes that statement when you're seeking it out of a 40
minute speech?

Until now, there was no solution to this conundrum, and that stemmed from a dearth in
publicly accessible tools for finding things in video. While the text search industry booms at
hundreds of billions in market cap today, the video search industry for finding things inside
video is virtually nonexistent. Youtube’s keyword search does not help you find a quote in a 40
minute video, and this is where Vidy’s NLP-powered search and video highlights database
comes into play. Vidy has transcribed millions of videos and analyzed, indexed, and processed
them for free accessibility by the public across its mobile clients and API channels.

With a Vidy integration on the Washington Post website, while reading that quote in the article
you could just hold down to reveal Trump saying that quote right there. The following shows a
demo of Vidy’s layer in action with a Trump quote. The video is accessed by a hold and the
video is controlled via gesture movements on a superimposed layer.

Now every quote that the Washington Post cites within its publications can have a
corresponding video of that speaker actually saying it, seamlessly nested behind the text.
Reporters, editors, and writers get free access to Vidy’s database of millions of video highlights,
updated daily, to find each relevant clip with just a search, or can submit any long form video
or link and let Vidy’s uploader kick out a short vidy of that highlight in seconds. This is a tool
that no publication has today and every publication needs today.

ag
In another example, picture yourself browsing through the comments section of a platform
such as Twitter, with users communicating back and forth replying to a tweet that has been
made by a popular celebrity. As people weigh in, their main methods of communication in
comments typically range from text and emoji to sticker and gif.

In the social media world, each text post and reply that you make embodies you digitally - your
voice, your tone, your take, and your delivery. And today, this is almost always done in text
form due to our existing UX constraints on the web and on small-screen mobile devices that are
short on real estate. But imagine if you could deliver that reply in the comments section by
speaking it in video form, and other people could hold down on your transcribed text reply to
watch you emerge and say it in a vidy.

The following shows a demo of Vidy’s layer in action with a response from user Pewdiepie’s
account to a Trump tweet, and an embedded vidy of him shouting it within his quote. The
video is accessed by a hold and the video is controlled via gesture movements on a
superimposed layer.

Additionally, here is a demo illustrating how vidy can be nested in the comments sections of
any website, with a Disqus integration being specifically spotlighted here given their market
reach with online publishers. In this demo, the commenter’s own vidy is nested into their text

As illustrated from these examples, Vidy’s technology is applicable across all domains that have
text, from articles and wikis right through to social networks and comment sections. Any
contained body of text can be augmented with the power of video to give the conveyance of a
statement a new dimension.

In a final example, picture yourself reading a Buzzfeed listicle about Apple’s new iPhone X that
has just been released, alongside a comparison of other top-line smartphones that have recently
launched from other brands. The article details each product’s respective specs, gives
commentary on the editor’s opinions on each, and includes an image of each phone indenting
every paragraph, so that readers can consider the pros and cons of the available options in their
pursuit for the right smartphone purchase.

Buzzfeed can organically close the loop by integrating a Platinum OTP video ad, and give its
users the convenience to purchase in seconds right from the page. Buzzfeed also puts itself in a
strong position here to execute successful sales on behalf of these listed players, given that the
entirety of the article is a series of reviews essentially to help users make a purchase. It almost
feels nonsensical in today’s digital milieu that Buzzfeed does all of this, and then stops short of
actually facilitating the purchase on-page. But understandably, due to the complexities around
lack of standardization and the fragmentation of the industry, it remains impossible for them to
execute, not to mention well out of their line of business to build. So instead they write about
these products, sell banner ads, and just hope to collect affiliate money through website taps.

Similarly, an article detailing the impeding release of a new Tesla Model X car could have a
“Reserve Now” button above the playing video ad. As a user you could watch a few seconds of
the ad by holding down. You get to hear the engine rev, see the full 360 view of the car, watch
it being taken for a test drive, all in an embedded vidy for a sentence talking about how great
the car show was. Then with just one tap on the button above, reserve your place on Tesla’s
waitlist for the car. A touch point to purchase that is this intimate and convenient is
unprecedented on the internet today.

In essence, with Vidy’s single-page embed layer on sites that you already frequent, your
existing experience remains unchanged; and now it is augmented with the new dimension of
embedded video when you choose to hold and consume it. You possess the power to choose
when to hold and when to skip, so your life just got that much better.

9. Vidy Revenues

Vidy’s primary company focus is delivering steadily increasing value to the utility of VidyCoin
(VIDY) for the good of the ecosystem that relies on it to operate. VIDY is not only a utility for
advertisers, publishers, and users, but it is the life blood of the decentralized system itself, and
what incentivizes miners to drive it forward. The Vidy platform was built to be self-sustaining
whether company revenues are generated or not, and as result, revenue propositions come
second for us within the scope of platform feature design. But thanks to the mutual rewards
that all parties reap from each transaction on the platform, Vidy is able to share in the benefits
as well. Vidy’s three revenue streams are as follows:

9.1 Revenue 1: Ad placement payouts

For each second that a user holds down on an embedded vidy, a payout calculation is made and
VidyCoin is debited from the advertiser’s account and distributed to the publisher and the
holding user. Vidy takes a fraction of this payout as well. The following example payout
calculation illustrates what a typical distribution would look like:

9.1.1 Calculations

User hold time: 3.4 seconds

Fiat value of hold: $0.0942

VIDY current fiat value conversion: 1 VIDY = $0.015
Hold x Fee current rate: lsec = 1.847 VIDY

Total Advertiser fee: 6.28 VIDY

9.1.2 Payouts

Publisher payout (85%): 5.338 VIDY
User payout (3%): 0.1884 VIDY
Vidy payout (7%): 0.4396 VIDY
Miner payout (5%): 0.3141 VIDY

As a user holds down, the rate of VidyCoin they receive is directly proportional to how long
they hold for. Early in their hold, users earn less VidyCoin per second than later in their hold as
the velocity of the earnings payout to the user increases. Vidy will launch with this user payout
embodiment after more user testing around the results of incentivizing longer holds for more
VIDY earnings.

User payouts can be magnified by up to 1.5x if the holding user has installed and currently
runs the Vidy Chrome extension on their browser. The bonus payout to user comes out of Vidy’s
end. A miner’s payout is delivered every 3 days after passing a threshold of VidyCoin earnings
and successful block adding-events.

All ad placement payout sizes and ratios are subject to change, particularly as Vidy’s product
progresses out of beta status and into full-fledged production v1.0 mode. Below is a pie chart

placement payouts:

Section 9.5 of this whitepaper details Vidy’s Velocity Payout Progression algorithm (VPP) which
is used to calculate payouts to users under an ever increasing earnings rate based on hold time.
The equation below however is a much simpler method for dislaying a fixed rate of earnings
for payouts to users, to be tested alongside the velocity method. Here, all payouts are flat
realtime conversions of fiat price with the input of hold time, and this equation uses the 3%

9.2 Revenue 2: One-Tap Purchase Payouts

Each time a user makes a one-tap purchase on the embed layer, the advertiser receives a
VidyCoin payout for the purchased product from the purchasing user’s token account. A
fraction of this VidyCoin payout to the Advertiser again goes to the publisher, the miner, and to

ag
Vidy. There is no NPP payout slice for OTP transactions on the platform. A publisher’s payout
on OTP is the equivalent of affiliate money that exists today, but can be a multiple of the typical
affiliate payout amount since that video ad embed is generating a direct purchase rather than
just a page land. Likewise, Vidy’s payout commission for successful purchases can be much
higher than its ad placement payout. A miner’s payout for OTP payments stays level relative to
their ad placement payouts. The following example payout calculation illustrates what a typical
distribution would look like:

9.2.1 Calculations

Fiat value of purchase: $24.99

User purchase price: 489.804 VIDY

VIDY current fiat value conversion: 1 VIDY = $0.015
Affiliate payout ratio: 10%

Affiliate amount: 48.98 VIDY

Advertiser receives: 440.824 VIDY

9.2.2 Payouts

Affiliate payout total pie: 48.98 VIDY
Miner payout (fixed): 0.3141 VIDY
Affiliate payout after miner: 48.6659
Publisher payout (85%): 41.366 VIDY
Vidy payout (15%): 7.2998 VIDY

As demonstrated from this example, the publisher’s payout is 41.366 VIDY from a total
purchase price of 489.804 VIDY, representing almost double what a typical affiliate commission
would look like. All OTP payout sizes and ratios are subject to change, particularly as Vidy’s
product progresses out of beta. Below is an illustration detailing the VidyCoin payout pie that
Vidy currently operates with for OTP payouts:

9.4 The Non-Profit Pool (NPP)

Vidy wants our offline future to be as bright as what it believes our online future will become
thanks to decentralization. The best way that it can help do that is by supporting the brilliant
charitable organizations around the world whose sole purpose it is to help push humanity
forward with their selflessness.

In Vidy’s ancillary pursuit to drive social good on its platform, it will be allowing 10 charities to
participate in its Non-Profit Pool (NPP). The NPP will be a group of charitable entities chosen
by Vidy, and each of these non-profit participants will have access the shared pool of VidyCoin
in the NPP which grows with each video ad hold that takes place on the Vidy platform.

Among a number of criteria, these organizations will be chosen on the basis of their impact and
their mission, and must exist to solve some of life’s biggest problems, such as low-cost
education in developing nations, cures for disease and human impairment, and aid for
populations suffering from disaster and famine. A number of these 10 chosen non-profit
organizations will potentially be voted in by the Vidy community over social media, over the
course of a voting period post-ICO.

How it will work is simple. Vidy will apportion a piece of its payout on each hold to go to the
NPP. It will be from this Vidy payout slice that the NPP will receive its own steady stream of
VidyCoin each time any user on the platform watches a video. NPP VidyCoin payouts will be on
some to-be-determined timeline of lock-up.

This means that every time that you hold down on an embedded vidy, not only are you earning
VidyCoin for yourself, but you are earning it for some of the most noble and most just causes
that exist. With each second that you hold, you are a part of the solution. You are giving back
to humanity. Users who complete certain tasks and reach certain performance and activity
milestones on the Vidy platform will be able to access ‘boost modes’ for generating VIDY that
both they and the NPP earn when they hold down on embedded vidys, thereby helping them
donate multiples more money for the causes they care about.

Vidy will also be initiating a Heroes Leaderboard which will be opt-in for platform users who
want to turn their profiles public and participate in the contest live on the vidy.com website.
The Heroes Leaderboard will reward the users who have given the most tothe NPP indirectly
via their aggregate hold times being the longest in the ecosystem. Top ranked users on the
global charts and regional charts will earn exciting prizes including trips, meet-ups with
celebrities, and access to VIP events for their part in helping NPP’s rewards grow.

9.5 User Payout Via Arithmetic Progression

Users are paid based on an in-house Velocity Payout Progression algorithm (VPP). As a user
holds down, the velocity of their VidyCoin earnings rate increases by each passing second. The
rate that they receive VidyCoin is directly proportional to how long they hold for. Early in their

hold, users earn less VidyCoin per second than later in their hold as the rate of the earnings
payout to the user increases. Vidy employs this user payout embodiment as a strategy to
incentivize users to hold through full video ads, given that their compensation will increase
exponentially as they do. Longer holds mean more VIDY earnings. Here are the notations for
the Velocity Payout Progression (VPP) algorithm:

Notations:

a, : the pay rate for the first second of hold
Gn : the pay rate for the n second of hold
d : every other second is d more than the previous second,
which means a, +1l-a, = d
For inventive reasons, we set d > 0
S, : the total payout earned for n seconds of hold time
q : the final second of the pay rate is q fraction of the total amount of the pay
rate which means an = gSn
For economical reasons we set g < 1

Here are the compound input values used:

Sn = na, + nd(n-1)/2
Bn = Gi + (n-1)d

an = qn

ql

d>0

Here is the full equation solved:

a, +(n—1)d n
— = = a &% (l= in—L)d: <..0-%, —
Sn na; +nd(n — 1)/2 (1-5 )(n—1)d < 0 < nay—ay

na, +nd(n—1)/27° ~

Therefore with an appropriate set of initial values for g, d, a,, we can use arithmetic
progression to model the VPP relationship between hold time on a video ad and pay rate. The
iteratively increasing pay rate can incentivize the viewer to watch more ads for longer, and
with = 2 constre— of g, we can always ensure that the highest VPP pay rate is always less
than the total acceptable payout amount earned.
10.1 The Effects of Payout Incentives on Effort and Performance

Vidy’s user payouts practice is not just wholeheartedly deserved - its backed by economic
theory. Compensatory incentives exist in the market to increase the level of effort, and
therefore the level of ensuing performance, from the agents receiving them. When examining
the input values of this payout incentives equation, three principal elements emerge - effort,
the mechanism for altering effort, and the environment within which the alteration occurs.

Effort can be quantified in a variety of manners, from duration and intensity, to direction and
development. The mechanisms that facilitate payout incentives which machinate the level of
effort are numerous as well, spanning expectancy and pre-conception to self-efficacy and
self-interest. And an environment’s variables of task nature, interpersonal impact, and incentive
scheme can all shape the outcome of effort via payout incentive as well.

The following visual from Bonner and Sprinkle’s 2002 literature emphasizes this conceptual
framework well.

Cognitive and Motivational Mechanisms
(Expectancies, Self-Interest [Expected
Utility], Goals, Self-Efficacy, etc.)

Monetary 3 Effort of Task
Incentives (Direction, Duration, Performance

Intensity,
Strategy, Development)

Person Variables (Skill, etc.)
Task Variables (Complexity, etc.)
Environmental Variables (Assigned Goals, etc.)

Incentive Scheme Variables (Rewarded Dimension
of Performance, etc.)

While arousal theory is one explanation for why payouts increase effort, with a vast amount of
social sciences literature throughout the years speaking to its proclivity to increase motivation
up to an optimal threshold (Broadbent 1971; Easterbrook 1959; Eysenck 1982; Humphreys &
Revelle 1984; Yerkes & Dodson 1908), there are other reasons for the boost as well.

In fact, there are four central cognitive mechanisms that impact the duration and intensity of
effort - expectancy theory, agency theory, goal-setting theory, and social-cognitive theory.
Vroom in 1964 published his expectancy theory, which stipulates that an individual’s
motivation is a function of two variables: a) the attractiveness of the outcome, and b) the
relationship between the effort and the outcome. This is the foundational premise behind

a
risk-reward theory which most people and firms are governed by today when making decisions
on business direction. In essence, money has a clear valence not just as an instrument for value
exchange, but also as a symbolic means of status conference as well.

Agency theory is constructed on the premise that individuals are fully rational utility
maximizers, conforming to a set of axioms. People under this theory are presumed to be
foremost motivated by self-interest, stemming from a utility function of wealth and leisure.
Goal-setting theory contrasts this conjecture by stating that personal goals are actually the
main engine spurring an individual’s actions and efforts. And social cognitive theory claims the
impetus is founded in self-efficacy, which translates into a positive emotional state via
value-signaling that then leads to better effort and performance.

Regardless of which theory reigns true however, environmental variables can always
contortively aggrandize or neutralize the outcomes from monetary stimulus. Notwithstanding
distortions in market equilibrium such as for example a deficiency in skill (where a person does
not have the skill or knowledge to perform at a higher level), monetary incentive theory can
result is more optimal market symmetry.

When it comes to execution, under this theory of skill distortion, a piece rate contract that pays
a user on the basis of their actions and gestures is more likely to attract individuals with higher
skills for the task, unless that task is architected to be simple enough for all participants. This is
the bar that Vidy has taken on in designing and building out its embed layer’s UX so that the
product is inclusive to all. This reduces adverse selection problems which are discussed in
Section 17 of this whitepaper under the economic theory of information asymmetry.

Likewise, task variables that are debilitating or overly arduous for users can derail the potency
of a monetary incentive that is shaping effort. This is why Hogarth in 1993 aptly contends, “To
understand decision making, understanding the task is more important than understanding the
people.” If you pay a user based on an action they perform on a video ad, and that action
results in deep cognitive or physical fatigue due to its complexity, sensitivity, or poor
presentation and responsiveness, then you introduce distortion into the equation. A hold is so
brutally easy and intuitive for mobile users to perform today that Vidy deftly evades this
potential equation limitation. And by pairing it with the dynamism of an autoplaying video,
Vidy combines just enough intricacy to have a direct impact on arousal via arousal theory.

There is theoretical and empirical evidence that suggests that subjects allocate more attention
to a task when the monetary benefits are the highest. Focusing on attention, which is a classic
resource allocation problem at the intersection of time scarcity and processing speed, Gabaix,
Laibson, Moloch, and Weinberg in 2002 conducted an illuminating study.

In this lab test, the cognitive operation that subjects engaged in was unmasking boxes in a
matrix where clicks into boxes rewarded users variably based on the sum of the row of boxes.
The action of unmasking an additional box in the context of this time constraint was in essence
the action of increasing their attention as time went on. If “a” represents the subject’s
expectations of the values in row A of the matrix of boxes, and “b” represents the expected
values in row B, if the agent does not execute the cognitive operator than the expected payoff

a
is whatever he believes the higher value to be, in other words: max(a,b) . If however the
subject does decide to execute the cognitive operator, then the expected payoff is:

E|max(a’,b)|] Where a’ is the updated expected payoff from row A. This allows us to state the
value of increased attention, or the value of the cognitive operator, as the difference between

the two: E|max(a’,b)| — max(a,b) if o represents the standard deviation of the updated a’ ,

then: 0? = E(a’,b)? . So now we can rewrite the value of increased attention as a function of
two variables: the difference between the payoffs (a — b) and the variation, or standard

deviation (c):

E|max(a’,b)] — max(a,b) = w(a — b,o)

Finally, this equation uses the information about the distribution of the payoffs, where @
represents the standard normal density function and ® represents the standard normal
cumulative density function. Then rewriting a — b as x, where x now represents the
difference between any active row and its next best alternative, we can again reformulate the
value of sustained and increased uattention (or an additional click on another box) as the
identity:

w(a,0)= 06 (2) — |x| (2!)

It is with this formula that we can gain two critical insights, specifically by examining how the
independent variables affect the value of the cognitive operator. First, the value of the cognitive
operator is a decreasing function of |x|, meaning that subjects will continue to click on more
boxes if the values between their two options are close. If the values between their two options
are very different, then their optimal choice is probably not to waste any additional time or
additional attention. The other variable of interest is 0, which tells us that the function
increases when the variation increases. This implies that the value of an extra Vidy hold
example increases with the variability of the information received.

Gabaix, Laibson, Moloch, and Weinberg found that the correlation between the number of
boxes opened programmatically versus the number opened by the study’s participants was
quite high registering at a score of 0.66. This proved that subjects allocated their attention
based on the variability of information obtained by the differences between the values of their
options.

Thus, our takeaway here is if there is a lot of variability in the embedded content on a page
presented to a user in the form of Vidylinks, and if it is still hidden, then the participant should
continue to hold. This premise is best attributed to today’s pop culture reference of FOMO, or
fear of missing out, which has become a marketing and product phenomenon that is deeply
rooted in human psychology.
We can use the quantitative attention allocation model of Gabaix and Laibson to craft an
embed layer experience that intuitively understands and operates on the two economic
principles upon which all sessions are governed by:

a. If a choice (an opened vidy) gains a large edge over alternatives, the value of continued
attention declines (since that vidy is consumed with enjoyment due to it being of a desirable
topic, and moving to a different vidy will likely result in less value)

b. If analysis yields little new information (when variability of embedded vidys dissipates
meaning that the surprise of the unknown no longer exists), then the value of continued
attention declines (users get bored and stop holding).

10.2 Piece Rate Payouts for VidyCoin

In moving now from theory to empirical evidence regarding piece rate payout benefits to Vidy
users, we can turn to Lazear. Lazear put forward a unique dataset in 2000 for his work
examining a key question in personnel economics - do monetary incentives truly boost
productivity. He utilized wage data and corresponding performance statistics from a large firm
called Safelite Glass Corporation to determine if average productivity in a firm changes when
the hourly wages become piece rate wages.

During 1994 and 1995, Safelite changed their compensation method and tracked the results.
Examining 3,000 different workers at the firm, workers were paid either $20 per windshield
under a piece rate model, or $11 per hour under a fixed rate model, whichever was the higher
amount. The units-per-worker-per-day figure was one of the primary measures used to gauge
productivity. The table below displays the mean units-per-worker-per-day, and note that it
increases from 2.70 to 3.24 after switching to piece rates.

Mean and Standard Deviations of Key Variables in Pay Structure

Hourly Wages Piece Rates
Number of observations 13,106 15,246
Variable Mean Standard Deviation Mean Hourly Wages
Units-per-worker-per-day 2.70 1.42 3.24 1.59
Actual pay $2,228 S794 $2,283 $950
PPP pay $1,587 $823 $1,852 $997

Cost-per-unit $44.43 $75.55 $35.24 $49.00

Lazear found this evidence a compelling attestation of piece rate compensation structure being
a key factor in determining productivity. But he continued further and analyzed the study from
a point of reconciliation as well, seeking out other potential sources that may have influenced
the dramatic increase in productivity. The considered specifications included variability in
timing, variability in worker-specifics, and variability in human capital. Even under these
changed circumstances, Lazear ultimately concluded that the gain in productivity was due to
changing its payout structure to piece rate wages. When the firm changed over, the average
output per worker increased by a whopping 44%.

Lazear’s results demonstrate not only that Vidy’s multi-party payout system serves as an
adequate means for payout incentive to further engage with advertisers, but also that it is the
most effective way possible for users to interact on the platform by virtue of its performance
based reward framework.

As Lazear’s data shows, by compensating Vidy users via a piece rate payout system based on
per-second hold times on video ads, we could expect under similar circumstances for users to
watch 40%+ more advertisements than if they were compensated under simpler terms such as
a fixed measure of attention structure or a flat session-time compensation schedule.
11. The Need For VidyCoin

The decentralized currency that will run this ecosystem will be VidyCoin (VIDY). VIDY will be
used as the sole means of value exchange for the following: a) all ad placements on the
platform with payouts from advertiser to publisher, b) all one-tap purchases on the platform
with payouts from user to advertiser, c) all hold time earnings on the platform with payouts
from advertiser to user, and d) all miner rewards on the platform with payouts from Vidy to
miner.

VIDY serves three core purposes:

a. A store of value
b. A medium of exchange
c. Amembership key

11.1 A Store Of Value

A store of value is the function of an asset that can be saved, retrieved, and exchanged at any
time in the future. VIDY embodies these properties as a utility token that possesses an
unlockable and reusable value on the platform for parties who own it.

VIDY is earned for services rendered such as a publisher offering its video ad inventory to an
advertiser, for actions taken such as a user holding down on an embedded vidy, and for
successful operations conducted such as a miner adding a block to the ledger.

As a coin, VIDY serves as transparent tokenization for service exchange, retaining its purchase
power into the future based on its respective utility value in the future. In essence, VIDY
changes hands on the platform based on the underlying utility that it provides the parties
transferring it. We can contrast this decentralized tokenization to that of the current centralized
system. With the status quo, one intermediary entity determines payouts through internal
policies and calculations, and complicated remuneration for service exchange ensues where a
fragmented network of buyers and sellers suffer through no transparency for their respective
bids, asks, spreads, payouts, and placements.

Therefore, the existence of VIDY, and the protocols around its transfer and underlying utility,
serve foremost as an anti-fraud measure, so that complete transparency and recourse exists for
all parties on the platform. All value is marked in an immutable ledger for everyone to see, to
agree with, and to abide by.

11.2 A Medium Of Exchange
A medium of exchange is an intermediary instrument used to facilitate the sale, purchase, or

trade of goods between parties. By design, it must represent a standard of value accepted by all
parties in order to function, so fiat currency is a good example.

ag
The ad industry desperately needs a decentralized medium of exchange to alleviate the issues
that plague both sides of every placement transaction, and to render obsolete the many
leeching middlemen that charge buyers and sellers to do everything from “verification of the
other side”, to “transaction due diligence”, to “smart fraud offset”, to “priced inventory re-sale”.
All of this is much too complicated and unnecessary, and one token maintained in an
immutable ledger and accepted by all parties as the only means of exchange can solve it.

The answer is VIDY. VIDY is a trustless token that no central body or owning entity controls or
calculates payouts using. All distribution is effected via open source protocols for complete
transparency across the full ad buying spectrum.

When publishers receive VIDY from advertisers for displaying their video ads, they can rest
assured they received the full amount they were owed for the respective seconds the video ad
was held down on their site for. They know the transaction, hold time, payout amount, and
funds will be marked, sent, and saved for the future.

11.3 A Membership Key

The membership key system is the necessary hierarchy on the Vidy platform to ensure top
advertisers with the best advertising campaigns are integrated with as many publishers as
possible, so that end-users have the best shot at consistently enjoyable experiences when
interacting with the Vidy embed layer. This automated quality filtration system is based around
the premise of staking VIDY.

Advertisers stake VIDY for greater access to the platform’s suite of advertising controls, which
are unavailable to companies operating on the free tier. The stakeholder tier structure for
coinholders who want to advertise with Vidy goes from Titanium, to Gold, to Platinum. Each
additional tier unlocks greater freedoms and stronger tools to execute successful video
advertising campaigns on the platform. Advertising features tied to each tier are described in
the next section under the stakeholder tier structures.

All of the VIDY that an advertiser stakes can be used toward their ad budget for payouts to
publishers, so effectively the staking serves as a guaranteed ad spend to use the Vidy platform.

In this way, VIDY retains its value whether it is an up market or down market since its

underlying utility as a staking mechanism is always relevant and necessary for platform
operations. Without VIDY, advertisers cannot conduct full fledged embed layer campaigns.

11.4 Stakeholder Tiers

Access to Vidy’s advertising utility comes from possessing enough VIDY to unlock its
stakeholder tiers of advertisement products. In total there are 4 tiers of membership on the
Vidy platform:

ag
a. Free tier
b. Titanium tier
c. Gold tier
d. Platinum tier

11.4.1 Free Tier
Cost: No VIDY staking required

¢ Ability to upload one video ad at a time to queue for distribution on the embed layer
e Access to the Vidy control dashboard with basic features and reporting

¢ Caps on campaign size, spend, duration

e No guaranteed demographic targeting, only NLP matching

e No guaranteed campaign placement timeline

e Concurrent ads in live campaigns capped at one video

Anyone can advertise with Vidy’s embed layer platform with no VIDY staked. When they go to
vidy.com/advertise they just sign-up for a free account, fill in the necessary company details,
and can start creating their campaign with videos. In order to start a campaign, they will need
to purchase VIDY either through the control dashboard or through an exchange, and they will
need to stake that VIDY against the ad spend they designate for the campaign. One of the main
limitations of the free tier is that advertisers will not be able to guarantee that their campaign
will be filled immediately or on the schedule they request since preference in video ad
placement will go to advertisers at tier Titanium and above. By offering a free tier to
companies, Vidy ensures that its platform is open, accessible and beneficial to anyone who
wants to use it to grow their business.

11.4.2 Titanium Tier

Cost: Stake 300k VIDY

e Ability to upload unlimited video ads to queue for distribution on the embed layer
e Access to the Vidy control dashboard with mid-tier features

e Unlimited campaign size, spend, duration

e Guaranteed demographic targeting

e Guaranteed campaign placement timeline

e Concurrent ads in live campaigns capped at two videos

Advertisers who stake at least 300k VIDY will unlock guaranteed demographic targeting in
their video ad campaigns, which will give them the power of both consensus driven NLP
matching along with demographic filtering from smart contracts. They also unlock guaranteed
campaign placement timelines so that their video ads aren't waiting in the queue for
placement. A Titanium tier advertiser’s main limitation is in how many concurrent video ads
that they can go live with at the same time.

ag
11.4.3 Gold Tier

Cost: Stake 700k VIDY

e Access to all the features from Titanium tier

e Access to the Vidy control dashboard with full features

¢ Unlimited concurrent ads in live campaigns

e Ability to designate preferred publishers to embed with, and publishers to avoid

Advertisers who stake at least 700k VidyCoins will unlock the full feature suite in the control
dashboard, including full analytics, reporting, creatives resources, vidy masks and effects,
vidlylink customizations, and ab testing modules. Gold tier advertisers will also be able to run
as many video ads concurrently as they want, giving them the power to glean insights into
on-the-fly ab tests to get to the highest converting video ad campaigns faster than lower tier
advertisers with caps. They also unlock preference designations for publishers they want to be
embedded with and publishers they want to avoid, which is property placement information
that the consensus layer receives when determining distribution of video ads to specific
publishers. All preference designations are not guaranteed, but give the advertiser priority over
other advertising companies.

11.4.4 Platinum Tier

Cost: Stake 1 Million VIDY

e Access to all the features from Gold and Titanium tiers
¢ Unlock the one tap purchase modal

Advertisers who possess at least 1 million VidyCoins will get access to everything available in
the Vidy advertising ecosystem. In addition to receiving all tools that lower tier advertisers
have, they will unlock the one-tap purchase modal along with all of its linked features that
come with customizing OTP for the best conversions.

There are 115 million companies worldwide that need to advertise to grow their businesses.
Vidy is allowing only a max of 10,000 companies worldwide at any one time to have access to
its Platinum tier, a ceiling that exists from the basis of its total available pool of VidyCoin. As
such, Vidy’s one-tap purchase modal is a valuable commodity for early adopting advertisers
looking for a conversion edge, and with a growing scarcity in the supply of VIDY via this
staking system, will become a feature that appreciates in value for its advertising holders.

12.1 The Vidy Technology

Backed by its Al-engine and crowdsourced curation pipeline working in conjunction with one
another, Vidy aggregates and amalgamates the best video content across the web, and serves its
highlights in bite-sized form called vidys, all in a matter of seconds. The result of this system
has been that Vidy has grown a database of video content that spans tens of millions of clips,
now all accessible for free to publishers during their page creation process.

Dozens of micro-services and 100s of thousands of servers in the Vidy stack come together in
symbiosis to facilitate a flow of speedy content retrieval right through to thoughtful content
consumption. Vidy sources, ingests, transcribes, timestamps, analyzes, labels, converts, crops,
indexes, orders, curates and serves up video highlights across any topical domain and
language.

Vidy delivers its content with a patented natural-language powered search that displays video
content based on the words that are uttered in them. While former search engines have
allowed users to search for videos by keyword, topic, or hashtag, with Vidy you can search
inside videos by querying the actual words that are spoken in them. This offers an element of
contextual relevance and granular discoverability that is remiss in the greater search engine
industry.

Now we are taking the most important component of our technology, our NLP-search and
assignment algorithm, and making it open-source so that it can become the crux of a
decentralized distribution platform that puts users first.

Vidy’s single-page embed layer is applicable to anything that has text online, including articles,
web pages, listicles, social posts, comment sections, digital books, pdfs, and even images and
video via OCR.

12.2 Vidy’s Segmentation Neural Network

Vidy obsesses over the appearance and user interface of its embedded vidys on a daily basis,
since the interaction of holding down and seeing a video emerge on an existing page has to be
seamless in all contexts. With the mission to make this a weightless experience, Vidy has
embarked on a project to process its video database with unique transformations so that a
video’s speakers can jump out of the page when they emerge on hold. To this effect, Vidy has
trained a convolutional neural network that segments out the main speaker’s face and body in
any video frame. Using deep learning on the images in the video, Vidy pushes the consumption
of its clips to their bleeding edge through the augmentation of their digital appearance, so that
when someone shares a vidy with you or you come across a vidy online, you know it’s a vidy
from its identifying visual characteristics.

Vidy’s convolutional neural network segmentation API that was modeled and trained in-house
is run on all videos in the database, along with all newly uploaded videos that an advertiser
adds to their campaign dashboard. After segmentation, Vidy then applies a 2-D holo mask to
the video. This video output version is available to all advertisers for free, along with the
standard version embed which keeps the uploaded video in its existing aspect ratio. Advertisers

can customize their embedded videos across different aspect ratios, segmentation types, and
mask effects before going live with them.

Vidy's image segmentation harnesses recent deep learning techniques, and relies on a large
amount of labeled data to train a deep neural network that achieves high accuracy for
segmenting the person in the video from the background. The network is based on the recent
MASK R-CNN, which is the state-of-art network for instance segmentation. The original
network consists of several residual blocks and has two branches, one for the segmentation
mask and the other for the category label. The segmentation branch uses de-convolution layers
to concatenate with the residual blocks and output a segmentation mask, while the label
branch uses a fully connected layer to output a category of the object. Since the central use
case on the Vidy platform only requires segmenting out the person as the foreground and does
not require the classification or categorization of the object, Vidy only keeps the segmentation
branch of the network. During training, the input is an image containing a person, and the
ground truth is the segmentation mask of that person. Each time, the weight of the network is
updated using the following cross entropy loss:

loss(x,y) = > yp» logx, + (1 — yp) log(1 — 2,).
Pp

Here x is the predicted segmentation mask, and y is the ground truth mask. The loss is summed
across the entire image over all pixels, where for y each pixel p is either foreground (1) or
background (0). The prediction x is a number between 0 and 1 and indicates the probability
that it is foreground. At Vidy we train the network such that the output mask x is consistent
with the ground truth y, while minimizing the loss. After training is finished, we use the trained
network to segment every frame of the video to segment the person from the background. The
network achieves both high-accuracy results and real-time processing capabilities.”

12.3 Prevention Of Inappropriate Content

In addition to weighing the transcription data and advertiser-designated keywords of submitted
video ads, Vidy also runs image recognition on all uploads to determine their rating and
appropriateness score. Vidy’s in-house image recognition algorithms, built on top of SIFT,
recognize familiar characters, scenes, and faces in videos to make determinations on what
creatives can be placed and what creatives cannot.

Vidy has also trained image recognition models specifically around nudity and extreme
violence, built on top of Facebook’s great open source projects like DeepMask, SharpMask, and
MultiPathNet. Vidy runs facial recognition and its own in-house face detection scripts on all
videos in its database to track the primary face for its input coordinates when adjusting clip

aspect ratios. Advertisers consequently have a host of custom controls for video ad display from
their control dashboard, from zooming in on the video speaker, to changing border ratios.

When Vidy pinpoints nudity or illicit images, it flags and locks that video upload and notifies
the uploading advertiser through the control dashboard. In this way, Vidy can proactively spare
publishers from dealing with inappropriate content on their sites and can safeguard users from
unwanted exposure.

12.4 Disrupting The Search Status Quo

The current search climate is one that has remained stagnant for almost two decades. It was
erected on the framework whereby a single centralized player, such as a Google in the US or a
Baidu in China, largely monopolizes the digital gateway to all information for all people of that
region.

This type of central power threatens the freedom, safety, and progress of the people it serves,
since all decisions as to what information is served, including when, where, and how are left to
the sole discretion of the actors who control it.

It also undermines the utility of the engine itself over time since the probability of adverse
change grows the more market externalities transpire that an internal team must react to and
adapt to. Privatized search is not after all a public utility whereby regulations are eschewed on
it from a governing body claiming to hold the public’s best interests at heart. Capitalists would
argue that the pressures of profit keep private companies honest in a capitalist society when
there is competition, but when you look at the search industry, there is no competition.

All centralized search engines have the same characteristics - they possess one core property
accessible via various wholly-owned applications, they have little to no competition, and they
are propped up by the inbound traffic that they pay for. This establishes a profit-driven model
where the flow of information to their users is always locked to the value that the search
engine reaps in its profits. That of course is the antithesis of free knowledge and information
distribution.

Enter Vidy. Vidy is different because it is flipping the search model on its head, thanks to
blockchain. By decentralizing its video search services through a consensus layer where many
miners make the placement decisions in realtime, Vidy is able to achieve production-level
utility paired with a necessary scalable precision driven by open-source NLP models.

Vidy’s embed layer SDK is run on a plethora of different platforms, and empowers the many,
not the few, to control the destiny and the output for all video embeds. Vidy safeguards the
veracity, identity, and security of its users by containerizing their info with smart contracts.
Unlike Google and Baidu who associate real identities with data collection and expose them
across a myriad of their services, and who benefit greatly from an exclusive and hidden
nebulous of selling this data, Vidy provides advertisers, publishers, and users with full fledged
transparency.

13. Terms Of Issue For VidyCoin

Vidy is directly taking on the $300 billion dollar a year digital ad industry. Our technology
promises to shake up the industry’s entire intermediary market of exchanges, networks, and
middlemen that control hundreds of billions of dollars in ad placement revenue, and we need
the right amount of capital resources to ramp up our decentralized technology to scale, to build
out a global partnerships team for acquiring a roster of thousands of advertisers, and to index
10s of millions of pages of publisher content for vidy embeds.

Our ultimate goal is to introduce the world to crypto through the bridge of embedded
entertainment and ecommerce. Blockchain can be a challenging concept to first digest for
many, but manifestable value that you can interact with through a touch and a hold is instantly
clear. This is why we are confident we can convert millions of normal consumers to become
token holders of VidyCoin through the natural gateway of Vidy’s free embed layer as people
organically discover and interact with vidys on millions of publisher pages.

The industry needs product bridges like the Vidy platform if it wants the utility of
cryptocurrencies to be accepted by the mainstream. We are also building our own unique
platform atop of the Ethereum blockchain, with infrastructure that will be tailored specifically
to the high throughput, demanding scalability, and consensus service nuances that a realtime
decentralized ad distribution platform like Vidy requires. We need to employ a number of
ecosystem-specific strategies to our stack, from delayed reconciliation to realtime placement
protocols, and as a result we need capital to build a strong, self sustaining, high performant
blockchain solution for advertisers and publishers looking to handle billions of transactions.

13.1 Issuance & How to Purchase

VidyCoin will be issued on the Ethereum blockchain using the ERC20 token standard for Vidy’s
ICO. The ICO crowdsale period will be August 31 - December 31, and will follow the pre-ICO
round and private sale round for whitelisted investors. There is no guarantee that all VidyCoin
will not be sold by the start date of its ICO crowdsale. To be whitelisted, go to
vidy.com/whitelist to sign-up.

Purchase method accepted: ETH

The token sale’s starting ETH price equivalent of 1 VIDY will be set at 0.00001782 ETH. This
figure respresents the ICO price, and the token sale’s Pre-ICO price and private sale price will
differ. No fiat currency will be accepted in the crowdsale.

In order to have the best shot at participating in the crowd sale, be sure to sign-up so that you

can be added to the official whitelist. This will give you access to all Vidy notifications via email
and will put you on the fastest track for contributing.

ag
13.2 Fundraising Caps

The soft cap will be set at 15,000 ETH (roughly $6m as of the contributions start period)
The hard cap will be set at 60,000 ETH (roughly $24m as of the contributions start period). Fiat
numbers here are for illustrative purposes, caps will be governed by these two ETH amounts.

If Vidy does not reach its 15,000 ETH soft cap in total proceeds raised through ICO and private sale
by the end of the fundraising period, it will hand back all ICO funds to all contributors. This is
Vidy’s pledge to its early ICO backers that it is on a war path toward building a large self-sustaining
platform, and is committed to a full raise. Until the public ICO begins, the team reserves the right
to adjust issuance splits between private sale and public sale allocation totals.

13.3 Issuance Provisions

The VidyCoin pool will be capped at 10 billion coins to be issued. Vidy will never issue more than
10 billion coins, which will remain the full pool of available VIDY. This perpetual cap is Vidy’s
baseline value-oriented pledge to its long-term coin holders. It will be allocated as follows:

52% Token Sale (crowdsale and private placement)
- 26.4% Public
- 25.6% Private (public-private split subject to change slightly)
25% ad pilots, partners, marketing, & advisors (distributed to the team if any left unallocated)
0.5% bounty program
0.5% airdrop
22% team

Lock-ups:

Team: 12 months (vests monthly after 6mos)
Advisors: 6 months (released after 6mos)

Public Sale ICO: no lockup

Pre-ICO: 3 months (released after 3mos)

Private Sale all tiers: 6 months (released after 6mos)

52% Token Sale (Crowdsale & Private)
25% Ad Pilots, Partners & Advisors

22% Team

0.5% Bounty Program

0.5% Airdrop

13.5 Airdrop

Vidy plans to airdrop 0.5% of its total accessible pool of VIDY via a partner exchange and/or
direct to a random selection of ETH addresses that have at least 1 ethereum in their wallet and
are active addresses having conducted a recent transaction, with a hopeful target of about 50
million users. It roughly anticipates about 5-10% of airdrop receivers will become claimants.

13.6 Bounty Program

Vidy is allocating a further 0.5% of its total available pool of coin for the bounty program
leading up to the public crowd sale. Please see Vidy’s separate bounty document online for
details on the program and how to earn as much VidyCoin as you can within this allocation
amount. Go to vidy.com/bounty to access the document, and start bringing friends into the
Vidy ecosystem.

13.7 Crowdsale Contract

The crowdsale contract uses the TBD’s in-house Crowdsale Library. This library provides
functions for a standard crowdsale in which users send ETH to the crowdsale contract and then
withdraw the tokens purchased. This requires a two-step process for participants, which is

ag
designed as a security precaution. Participants send ETH and the contract allocates their
portion of tokens into a bucket. Participants then request a withdraw from the contract and it
sends tokens out of their allocation. This provides a layer of security between all tokens in the
contract and those allocated to each participant, and follows the security recommendations
found here http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/ develop/security-considerations.html. The
crowdsale contract uses timestamps and not block numbers. This does not present any
significant vulnerability, however, it should be noted that block miners have some control over
the timestamp recorded in the block they mine. This may result in the crowdsale ending a few
seconds later than advertised. The minimum raise limit for the Vidy crowdsale is as stipulated
in Section 13.2. All funds sent to the crowdsale will be made available to Vidy upon completion
of the sale. Participants should note there is a risk of loss if they send Ether from an exchange
account. Exchanges do not offer the ability to interact with crowdsales in general. A wallet
should be established outside of any exchange and Ether should be sent from that wallet to the
crowdsale contract.

13.8 Use Of Proceeds

The anticipated Vidy team’s use of proceeds is broken down below. This breakdown is likely to
change as the business and its strategy evolves, and is meant only as a rough indicator and in
no way is a set plan. It is at the sole discretion of Vidy’s board of directors to change these
allocations however it sees fit:

e 55% ad bidding system infrastructure, sales pipeline, innovation, Al development, investments

Vidy plans to aggressively expand throughout North America and Asia after its ICO, currently
preparing to onboard most multi-national brands that have major online ad-spend and
introduce them to the product.

With the proceeds raised, Vidy will invest heavily into the artificial intelligence field to bring on
board a team of deep learning specialists. Vidy believes that every technical challenge that it
faces today can be solved over time with a properly focused AI thanks to the massive dataset
that Vidy has already cultivated for which its NN’s can train on. This data edge that Vidy
possesses will bring an ever-growing competitive advantage to its Al program in the coming
years.

In North America, Vidy has strong ties to most of the big advertising brands throughout the US
and Canada. Vidy will continue to build in-roads with advertisers from all product and service
verticals, and will begin to move into more non-traditional publisher platforms with massive
user-bases. In Asia, Vidy is even stronger on the business development side, with contacts
spanning the top social, digital, news, and commerce companies in China, Indonesia, Japan,
Korea, and Singapore. It will continue to grow its reach throughout Asia and refine its
localizations. These two dominant regions will be where Vidy spreads across millions of
publisher pages, with the ultimate goal of becoming naturally ingrained in American and Asian
internet culture.

The Middle East, South America and Europe will follow as regions that Vidy will launch in,
with a target of late 2019. All of Vidy’s core offerings will be translated for these regions, and
the Vidy protocol’s NLP script will be tweaked where needed for the local nuances of each
geography. Beyond the details however, the Vidy product is largely language agnostic, and
therefore able to expand quickly worldwide as it looks to grow its publisher roster and greater
userbase.

13.9 Buying VIDY On Exchanges Post ICO

Vidy is committed to ensuring that VIDY can be purchased on exchanges shortly after its ICO.
While we are not able to announce which exchanges will be issuing VIDY, we can say that we
are already in talks with a number of exchanges and are making the accessibility and ease of
transfer for VIDY coin a top priority at the company. Join our Telegram group and our
bitcointalk.com thread to learn more about our plans, and to be close to the action when we
announce where we are listed. You can go to the home page of our website at vidy.com to find
links to these groups.
13.10 Vidy’s own Blockchain

Vidy is strongly considering building out its own Blockchain in the future based on the
scalability, performance, and high-throuput demands that a global, decentralized ad platform
uniquely requires. The existing blockchain options on the market today are too nascent and
architecturally vanilla to inextricably commit to for the full growth plans of the Vidy platform.
The Vidy team has unique insights into the technical, consensus-based, and data needs of its
network that clearly stand apart from the development priorities and feature-release cycles of
the other major blockchains.

Most importantly, the Vidy team recognizes that the world’s first invisible layer on the internet
could be greatly benefitted from apps of its own built on top of the Vidy blockchain to augment
Vidy user experiences. Vidy can imagine a day when ICOs are launched on the Vidy blockchain
to offer services from payment and ecommerce, to video and social. Vidy is not 100%
committed to this future just yet, but we will announce any developments regarding our own
blockchain. Should we decide to ultimately make this move, the Vidy token will be converted
in a 1:1 generation event to the new Vidy Blockchain owned token.

14. Vidy’s NLP Protocol

The Vidy ecosystem is run on NLP short for natural language processing, which serves as the
fuel that drives all realtime video placement decisions. The Vidy team has developed a
specialized expertise in the field of natural language over the years, and this is what makes our
vision for the first decentralized NLP placement protocol possible. This section will cover the
foundational premises behind NLP the historical progress in the field, and the current
embodiment employed by Vidy for its distribution platform juxtaposed to what has been
enacted in the past.

14.1 What is NLP

NLP is the application of computational techniques for the analysis and synthesis of natural
language and speech. NLP covers a wide spectrum of fields from speech recognition and
language generation to natural language understanding.

Since the statistical revolution of the 1990s, most NLP has been built on machine learning,
given that supervised engineering and manual rules-based approaches have proven to be
largely too time consuming, unscalable, and overall unfruitful in the field for research and
production-level products alike. As a result, statistical inference has emerged as a popular
method applied to learn a broad series of rules from the generalized analysis of a large corpora
of both correct and incorrect examples.

The field of machine learning-powered NLP has come a long way from the early days of
decision trees where systems were governed on hard if-then rules. Today, statistical model
approaches are widely used, where soft probabilistic decisions are applied based on real-value
weights or vectors of input features.

The key to a successful NLP strategy lies in the nuances rooted in the connections made, and
specifically in the ability to express relative certainty and uncertainty across many different
possible answers through vector assignment. The following section will provide an in-depth
breakdown of the list of inputs that comprise Vidy’s NLP algorithms, and the granular
approaches that bear them for all video ad distribution.

14.2 Vidy’s Algorithm Broken Down

Vidy has architected an advanced multi-faceted approach to determining natural language
placements, executed through deep learning and fundamental parts-of-speech targeting.
Language analysis is a complex task given the plethora of manners and styles that a thought
can be conveyed in written text. As such, knowing the context of both the entire document and
each line becomes of paramount importance when endeavoring to understand the overall
meaning of the words and phrases themselves.

ag
Just as Vidy uses a layered approach for the architecture of its decentralized platform built on
the blockchain, it also uses layers for its NLP strategy in order to achieve systematic filtration,
multidimensional analysis, and better mitigation of derailing edge cases. Each descending layer
in Vidy’s NLP funnel gets more and more granular as it focuses on a different defined area of
the sentence. All of these layers working in symbiosis with one another come back with a
decision on placement relevance in a split-second, making this strategy both deeply thorough
and highly efficient for massive scalability.

On the most basic of levels, Vidy’s natural language processing converts a character stream into
a sequence of lexical items (keywords, keyphrases, and syntactic markers) through structure
extractions and tokenizations which divide streams up into tokens which are identities that can
be further processed against other tokens.

Vidy begins by looking at the broad strokes of a publisher page that has been indexed by the
ingestion system. Vidy first conducts an automatic summarization of the publisher page,
amalgamating all sentences and outputting keywords and keyphrases (a fragment of multiple
keywords/phrases) that describe the page. This includes an extractive summarization
technique via maximal marginal relevance and graph-based textrank to try to highlight the
most informative subset of sentences from the publisher page. Vidy counterbalances its own
automated summarization with an evaluation of the keywords manually provided by the
publisher of both that specific page, and the publisher’s overall website and brand (umbrella
keywords). These analyses are conducted in conjunction with one other so that realtime
comparisons can be made, and a more robust understanding of the greater text can be achieved
via both automation and manual input.

Vidy then takes this generalized overview and analyzes a publisher page on a series of more
microscopic levels to determine the meanings of sentences themselves, the commonality of
their keywords, the greater sentiment of their topics discussed, and the list of discernible
parameters from which to compile an understanding of each line’s context.

A core component of Vidy’s NLP protocol includes sentiment analysis, which entails the
extraction of subjective information from a corpus of text and the emphasis of its polarity in
meaning, emotion, and opinion. By identifying these polarities in thought, Vidy can cleanly
filter most video ads into more targeted, albeit generalized, sentiment buckets. Sentiment
analysis is a higher level approach that is conducted near the top of the funnel of Vidy’s
placement protocol, since it offers only a macro filtration of relevant content with matching
inventory. But when an opposing sentiment is discerned, it trumps any placement decision on a
page, no matter how high the matching vector may be, so that a video ad that is a polar
opposite to the greater sentiment of a web page is never placed with that publisher’s content.

This helps ensure that advertisers do not have their video ads placed in inappropriate or
irrelevant advertising inventory locations, and that publishers are not confronted with
complaints and takedown requests. The biggest offender for ad misplacement today comes
from matches made with language-relevant, but contextually inappropriate, publisher pages.
This is a potent problem that many companies are struggling to grapple with, as alluded to
earlier with Google and Facebook’s significant annual investments in the attempted manual
alleviation of this challenge. Vidy tackles this issue in a scalable way through its natural

ag
language approach and through steady performance calibration, while also giving publishers a
final say to designate which advertisers they don't want on their platform, and likewise
advertisers to designate which publishers they want to avoid being placed with.

One of Vidy’s main information collection layers in its protocol hones in on parameters present
in each line of text. Parameters can include everything from enumeration, which is a series of
predefined named things, to details such as location, date, time, number, contact, distance, and
duration. Parameters are helpful not just because they simplify downstream processing, but
because they usually serve as anchor points in a sentence. Function, intent, and purpose for
example are often gleaned by the relationships that exist between a sentence’s entities and the
parameters that affect them.

A top-level parameter of the Vidy algorithm considers named entity recognition as a means to
denote proper nouns and company names of participating advertisers and their products,
services, partners, and competitors in order to better assign videos to keywords. A blanket
approach is taken here, where a company’s namesake, alternate names, and other high profile
nouns are identified and considered either ‘relevant’ or ‘irrelevant’ to a queued video ad
placement. Splinter features to named entity recognition include acronym normalization,
which Vidy concurrently runs to ensure all acronyms related to a named entity are accounted
for, and regex extraction, which lets Vidy pull hashtags, emails, URLs, and other similar entities
from the text.

Vidy then takes named entity recognition a step further by conducting relationship extraction
after nouns are parsed out, looking specifically at relationships that it can identify among the
named entities on the page. For example an article talking about Coca Cola could mention
Pepsi’s new flavored soft drink on a brief tangent, and Vidy would make the connection that
both of these named entities are competitors and acknowledge Pepsi’s product name. It would
then use this information to eliminate this sentence from a possible video ad match due to
irrelevance and conflict of topic to Coca Cola’s video ad campaign, despite the fact that “soft
drink” is a relevant keyword for Coke video ads.

As a final step, Vidy employs anaphora resolution by matching up all discerned nouns with all
of their respective pronouns in the greater body of text, thereby being able to distinguish
allusions across sentences to the parent noun for better contextual comprehension of the
discussed named entities. This technique serves as an additional layer of support to relationship
extraction since follow up statements in a paragraph are often described with pronouns rather
than repeating the nouns themselves when talking about the same entity.

As Vidy moves away from the top layer of its NLP protocol deeper into granularity, it looks at
lemmatization, stochastic grammar parsing, compound term processing, word sense
disambiguation, and coreference resolution in order to better distill the meanings of phrases
that it is scanning. These employed techniques represent the mid-section of the Vidy’s NLP
multi-layer protocol, and the following paragraphs cover brief descriptions of each.

ag
Lemmatization uses a language dictionary to perform an accurate reduction of word variations
to simpler root words. This is a more complete reduction and simplification of words than that
of stemming which is a rules-based pattern matching technique to strip token suffixes.
Decompounding is also a smaller piece of lemmatization, which is sometimes necessary to use
for specific words in other languages.

Stochastic grammar parsing is the process of determining the parse tree of a given sentence.
The two types of parsing in stochastic grammar parsing include dependency parsing, which
focuses on the relationships between words such as a sentences’s predicates and primary
objects, and constituency parsing, which builds out parse trees through probabilistic
context-free grammar.

Compound term processing is a statistical information retrieval technique that is comprised of
matching compound terms together. Query expansion is a well known similar practice to this,
but specifically built around information retrieval in a consumer-facing search engine. One
example of compound term processing is the compound term “triple base hit.” It is evidently a
useful method for more technical passages where a priori knowledge is not available, and
where combining two or more free morphemes to create compound terms with unique
meanings is more common.

Word sense disambiguation is the selection of proper meaning attributed to a word or series of
words that have many meanings, performed through a list of associated word senses that are
generated offline for each publisher based on the nature of their website’s content. While the
human mind is especially proficient when it comes to this, achieving high-performant word
sense results with machine learning has long been a challenge in the NLP field. Vidy’s
procedure here is using supervised machine learning methods where a word sense
disambiguation classifier is trained for each unique word in a corpus of manually annotated
example senses.

And finally, coreference resolution is the procedure of identifying which words refer to the
same objects in a line of text. This means bridging relationships through referred expressions
such as “He walked through Mary’s house toward the living room window” with “living room
window” serving as a referred expression that bridges the relationship between “Mary’s house”
and the “window”. Vidy uses this method to better understand references within the
boundaries of descriptive compound sentences.

On the lower levels of its layered protocol, Vidy conducts discourse analysis, which looks at
elaboration, explanation, and contrast between sentences to identify the discourse structure of
connected text. Discourse analysis also recognizes and classifies various acts of speech in a
sentence such as assertions, yes-no questions, and exclamation remarks. This technique ranges
from basic parts-of-speech tagging to more advanced clustering of content via phrase detection
and lexical semantics to identify central topics of discourse to compare against uploaded
videos. Lexical semantics, specifically, is the determination of computational meaning for
individual words in the context of a phrase or greater paragraph.

These methods ultimately lead to an overall natural language understanding of indexed
publisher content, which is one of the main goals of all of this systematic language analysis.

ag
Natural language understanding is the conversion of text into formalized first-order-logic
representations that are easier to manipulate, handle, and calculate. This involves
understanding the intended semantics from the natural language expression of the sentence.

14.3 The Protocol’s Lowest Level - Word Embedding

On the lowest level of Vidy’s NLP protocol is word embedding. Word embedding is a powerful
technique employed last in the execution funnel since it allows Vidy to simplify its plan of
attack into one focused and final neural network on top of all previously analyzed layers. Word
embedding is a mathematically embedded space of one-dimension per word mapped to a
continuous vector space with lower dimensionality. Basically Vidy produces a vector space of a
few hundred different dimensions and assigns a vector to each unique word in the training
corpora. When words in the corpora share similar meanings or contexts, Vidy positions them
close together in the vector space, as a means of mapping out contextual relevance across a
bevy of words. While there are numerous generation methods for word embedding, spanning
probabilistic models, explicit representation, and matrix dimensionality reduction, the Vidy
protocol focuses on a deep learning approach.

vec("“man”) — vec("king”) + vec(“woman’) = vec("queen’)

WOMAN —-
YT AUNT Q
_— a KINGS
UNCLE
QUEEN QUEEN
KING KING

Vidy takes some of the best aspects of Word2vec and others such as FastText and GloVe, and
builds upon them with its own proprietary in-house deep learning models on Tensorflow. Vidy’s
neural network is trained on a database of billions of data points that Vidy has amassed and
regularly adds to. This data includes keywords, phrases, paragraphs and documents that have
been both automatically and manually labeled by Vidy’s team of dozens of data curators (as the
figure below showing typical training samples gives a glimpse of). Vidy’s competitive advantage
against any other player in the NLP space today is the sheer amount of clean data it has to train
on for which it has devoted significant capital and human resources to in the past years to
cultivate. Data is the engine of AI.

Before going into Vidy’s neural network component, here is a brief overview of these three
baseline methods:

a. Word2vec is a group of shallow duo-layer neural network models that produce word
embeddings by reconstructing the linguistic contexts of words. Word2vec is trained on a
database of words. This means that when it comes across a word that was not present in
the corpus that it was trained on, it has trouble matching or identifying it. Sen2vec, which
is a version of the project that is used to identify matching sentences, and Doc2vec which is
a version of the greater project that is trained to identify matching full documents, are two
other embodiments of Word2vec that are also useful in different circumstances. Vidy does
not tap them in production however.

(WATER - WET) + FIRE = FLAMES
(PARIS - FRANCE) + ITALY = RUME
(WINTER - COLD) + SUMMER = WARM
(MINOTAUR - MAZE) + DRAGON = SIMCITY

b. FastText is Facebook’s answer to Word2vec. It is an unsupervised learning algorithm for
determining the vector representations of words. It is identical to Word2vec, but
instead of focusing on words, it trains on characters. This allows it to recognize and
understand words that it never worked with or trained on, whereas Word2vec fails on
any words that were not in its training set.

ag
c. GloVe, which is short for global vectors, is an open-source project out of Stanford that is
also a distributed word representation model. Like the other two, GloVe is an
unsupervised learning algorithm that was built to obtain the vector representations of
words. It is trained on aggregated global word to word co-occurence statistics from
corpora, and the output of GloVe are linear substructures of the word vector space.

The Vidy protocol uses elements of these projects in its low-level schema, and expands on them
with training on its multi billion-point dataset. Vidy’s neural network approach to embeddings
is not just for word to word vector representations, but also to classify a sentence into a group
of categories and keywords for cross-page topic recognition. Extracting meaningful tags to
match against the keywords of video ads helps to make clean matches faster through topical
filtration, and more importantly helps to make the available set of queued videos much smaller.
This figure below shows an example of mapping cities to countries and descriptive terms.

While the Vidy protocol’s top layer combines the approaches of named entity recognition,
relationship extraction, and anaphora resolution, Vidy’s bottom layer goes a step further and
employs rarified terminology extraction in order to gauge how rare, and therefore how
important to that specific page (respective to all indexed pages), a term may be for a specific
publisher and their content. Vidy achieves this vector space determination by analyzing the
occurrence of that term across the millions of pages that it has indexed and then by scoring
that term in a vector that is compared to all other vectors on the same plane. Vidy uses both
dictionary-based and complex pattern-based extraction in tandem with rare terminology
extraction to identify when token sequences occur in publisher sites from master terminology
lists rendered offline.

CBOW Skip-gram

The idea here is that similar words appear in similar contexts, which is called the distributional
hypothesis. The concept of representing a word as a prediction of its context, thereby yielding a
continuous representation of a word embedded in a vector space, turns out to be a very robust
technique for semantic representations of that word. In lieu of the continuous bag of words
approach which predicts a word given its context (as shown in the figure above), the protocol
chooses a skip-gram approach which predicts which words are in the context given a target
word.

Here’s how the method works. We begin by constructing a vocabulary from an examination of
the corpus, flagging all words that we find presented more than n times and adding them to
the set. Then for each word in the compiled vocabulary set, we initialize two vectors,
randomized by dimensionality and vector. These two vectors - one being a target vector
representing the word’s meaning, and the other being a context vector representing the word’s
context - are assigned to all words and combined in a matrix, giving us two |V| D matrices,
where D is the number of dimensions, and |V| is the number of words in the vocabulary. These
two matrices are termed the embedding matrix (which houses the main embeddings of each
word in the vocabulary), and the context matrix (which houses the context embeddings of each
word). Our objective here is to train the D-dimensional target vectors (which begin as
randomized values) to predict their context, thereby representing the target word’s meaning.
For every cycle of training that we perform thereon, we sample a target word wt from the
corpus and then estimate the probabilities of the context words wc given the target word wt:

+
exp (us, Ou

ee eee ee
y_ exp (ub ou

weV

p(We|wr) =

ag
This softmax function sets the values V as the list of all words in the vocabulary, u as the
vectors from the context matrix, and v as the vectors from the embedding matrix. This means
that context word probability is the function of a target vector and a context vector. Only
computing the full probability distribution of the vocabulary will result in generating context
word probabilities. After that, we backpropagate the prediction error through the target and
context vectors using gradient descent, in order to maximize the log probability over the set of

context words Cwt
2. log p(wWe|wr).
WceECw,

We backpropagate through |Cwt | words in the context matrix and one word in the embedding
matrix on each subsequent cycle of training. The purpose for this is to have the target word
effectively predicting its context words, with the goal of maximizing the average log-probability
over the set of all target words T

fovj(u, 2) al 7 ah y_ log p(We|wtz).

WET WceECu,

This process becomes extremely expensive the more words you have. A vocabulary with say a
million words becomes a great challenge to keep the probability generation efficient for
throughout each iteration. To solve this, Word2vec creator Mikolov in 2013 put forward a
negative sampling function, so that instead of computing the softmax over the whole
vocabulary, you can just sample a few words that do not appear in the current context, and
then modify your maximization objective to be a binary classification task that uses a sigmoid
function to estimate whether a word belongs in that context or not. This results in a far more
efficient maximization objective for us, which plays out as follows:

fovj(u, 2) -) ogo (iy. Vw,) + :. log o( —Uy, Vw,) |,

We = i Wy EN

This equation sets the value of N as the set of negative samples. By backpropagating the
prediction error on the objective through the target, the context, and the negative sample
vectors, we analogously update the model while enjoying big gains in efficiency. In the negative
sampling case, we adjust one word in the embedding matrix and |C| + |N | words in the
context matrix. As each cycle of training runs its course, the embedding matrix progressively
consists of more and more meaningful vector representations for each word in the vocabulary.

A component of Vidy’s neural network implementation is also inspired by the logic and
structure of image recognition models applied to word embedding. While an image is basically
a matrix of pixels, a sentence can also be regarded in the same sense. Instead of pixels
however, the sentence is a 2d matrix of words that you can feed to computer vision techniques
for text identification.

ag
On this matrix you have a word represented by an n-dimensional vector, just as a point in an
image is also an n-dimensional vector. For each token in the sentence we use word embedding
(one word embedding per row) to get vectors with fixed dimensions (dimension is d, length is
fixed at n). So the input is a 2 dimensional matrix (n, d) which is analogous to an image using
a CNN. When comparing images to determine similarities, you compare the matching score of
all the vectors in one image against all of the vectors in the other image, and this same practice
is done here with language. Even the scaling methods and the code around generating image
cluster centers and efficient matching from image recognition methodology is directly applied
on this protocol layer. To solve the curse of dimensionality that plagues all ambitious
recognition projects that pack a high number of dimensions into each vector for more advanced
matching capabilities, the protocol employs product quantization which has proven to be a
strong and versatile method for nearest neighbor search.

14.4 Feeding the Protocol

Vidy conducts two principal tasks when acquiring, refining, and sending off the information
that is needed to make an NLP match happen. The first is an indexing component on the
publisher side (crawling text and preparing it via the protocol’s uppermost layers), and the
second is a content pre-processing component on the advertiser side.

When a video ad is uploaded to the Vidy platform by an advertiser, Vidy runs a signal
processing audio cleanse algorithm on it to eliminate any non-stationary noise and other
intefers, and then transcribes the video through a speech-to-text engine. It also timestamps
each word that is uttered. After transcribing the uploaded video, Vidy then employs sentence
boundary disambiguation, which is a sentence breaking technique where sentence boundaries
are demarcated even though there is no punctuation present in the transcribed output to help
with segmentation. This is done to further learn about the meaning of what is being said
among phrases. From there the general sentiment of the video ad is denoted and listed in the
meta tag keywords which Vidy stores with the file, alongside the manually entered keywords
that the advertiser provides for the video ad upon upload.

Once this information is packaged and sent off, it reaches the consensus layer which is a
compartmentalization of two planes of placement decision. The first plane is purely on an NLP
level driven by the open-source protocol that all miners run on; and the second plane is on a
user profile filtration level. A user’s demographic profile which has been built by a collection of
data points and locked in smart contract is then applied to all NLP-matches to filter down the
correct embed for that visit; and the input factors include the following:

e The context of the greater publisher page through keywords and automated summarization

e¢ The context of the greater publisher website through keywords and automated summarization
¢ The context of the video ad through transcription, summarization, and advertiser keywords

e Keyword extraction from all applicable sentences on the indexed publisher page

e NLP analysis and vector assignment of all relevant keywords

e A set of matching video ads queued to move to stage 2 profiling assignment

¢ User profile examination and further filtration through demographic and visitor data

e Placement of selected video ad into corresponding publisher text based on campaign demand
from the advertiser
¢ Recalibration of performance for all placed ads based on data layer feedback

The scoring for NLP matches is iteratively adjusted as the data layer receives feedback on video
ad performance and user-specific activity on embed ads, and these scores get fed into the
topical vector assignments for better future representation assignments.

For the selection process when determining which phrases to embed vidys in out of all eligible
phrases within a publisher page, campaign demand is a prevailing decision maker. Beyond
extractive summarization recommendations, there is not a deep need to determine phrase
relevance respective to page relevance, or to make environment relevance supersede pure ad
campaign demand after an NLP+demographic match is made. The reason for this is that
overall ad spend and campaign impression volume purchased is at the end of the day what still
drives the advertising platform itself, and ultimately determines how often and where video
ads are placed among hosted publisher pages.

14.5 Takeaway

In closing this section, it is important to underscore that large mainline pieces of the logic,
structure, and framework behind Vidy’s NLP protocol will be open-source and accessible on
GitHub. It is our hope that this NLP project, which will forever be a continuing work in
progress, can continue to grow and improve with the collective support of the community and
the branched projects that we hope blossom from our starting point. Vidy will rely on the
community's feedback, support, and ingenuity to drive the world’s first open-source NLP
placement protocol forward. Our initial code marks just the beginning of what is to become a
big community win.

KALTENDIN THE BUSINESS TIMES

a
16.1 Team

The Vidy team is uniquely positioned at the intersection of East meets West, with a fusion of
Western engineering and Eastern business development. As such Vidy capitalizes on the ability
to tap the best minds in Silicon Valley for its innovation, and the most connected arms in Asia
for its groundbreaking global partnerships. This edge is one that Vidy sought to hone from its
inception, when Patrick Colangelo, the Founder of Vidy, partnered with Matthew Lim in Asia, to
cultivate a powerful cross-functional team.

Vidy boasts a world-class engineering team based in San Francisco with team members who
have previously sold their own companies, amassed 10s of millions of users, patented
multi-million dollar inventions, and have enjoyed decades of successes in the software
development world.

The Vidy team has been together for years, bonded by mutual admiration, friendship, and
ambition to build a platform that can truly change human lives for the better. As fervent
believers in blockchain and personal investors in technologies that exist for the betterment of
the human colossus, we have collectively devoted ourselves to the mission of letting content
and video ads be found, consumed, and enjoyed in a way that finally safeguards us and truly
garnishes us.

Vidy began when Patrick spent 30 minutes trying to find a clip from tv to text to a friend as an
inside joke. After searching over a dozen times for it, he finally came across a 7 minute video
where the scene was nested in between a 15 second portion of the video. This meant that his
friend would either have to watch the entire video to see it, guess where to tap to skip though
to get closer to the correct part, or worse yet that Patrick would have to crop the video himself
and then download it and send it. Wow. He immediately knew there had to be a better way.
Why was it so hard to find a short video highlight? And why was there no way to search inside
videos to get the parts you care about faster?

With the Vidy engineering team’s tenacity and ingenuity driving this vision forward, Vidy went
on to architect, build, and deploy the world’s first distributed NLP-powered search engine that
was run on transcribed videos. Vidy then added an AI-pipeline containing dozens of
video-processing microservices, and soon had a database of millions of video highlights. Since
then Vidy has built a handful of core products to showcase its technology on iOS and Android,
along with native mobile keyboards, and on the web. Now Vidy is taking its database, search,
nlp, and sdk technologies to the next level to solve the broken video ad industry.

The Vidy Company was founded out of Harvard, and has since grown into a 15 person
engineering operation in downtown San Francisco.

17. Conclusion

The internet has become a jungle. We walk inside it freely, and do what we please while there,
but we must endure a host of adverse elements if we choose to stay, from its unfriendly wildlife
(malicious click-baiting) and troublesome terrain (UI’s with no standardization), to its brutal
weather (disruptive interstitials, pop-ups, slow banner page loads) and the ominous feeling of
being followed (incessant user tracking). With these sorts of headwinds in our midst, it is easy
to lose our sense of direction and purpose as we navigate through. In the context of nature this
makes sense since all of these elements are well out of our control as humans, and we did not
create the forest or any of its features. But with the internet it is clearly different. We did create
it, and we did erect its ecosystems of social, data, advertising, and information transfer. We run
the companies that service it, we use the services that drive it, and collectively we are part of
the human colossus that inhabits it, because it is ours. Why then do we feel so powerless and
lost within it?

It is always important to fall in love with the problem, rather than the solution, when
embarking on a new challenge. Our team at Vidy picked the broken video ad industry because
we all realized this is bigger than just a business; this is a movement to galvanize internet users
all around the world to stand up for the sake of privacy and online wellbeing. If advertisements
have adversely affected your life in the past, and you did nothing about it, join the club. That’s
exactly what we did too, for decades. But today, in 2018, thanks to the gift of blockchain, we
finally have the tools in place to give people a choice. We can make things better for all parties
across the ad ecosystem.

Vidy has devised a tri-layer technical solution to attack this problem because the industry needs
not only decentralized distribution, or placement transparency, or data security, but arguably
most importantly, it needs inventiveness at the consumer ad display level.

Universal adoption rarely happens in technology outside of jurisdictions where governments
place mandates requiring the masses to adopt. As a result, when a product wants to reach that
pinnacle level of usage, it needs to possess three imperative qualities: brutal consumer-facing
simplicity, a strong financial or value-adding benefit to all parties who participate, and a
solution to the two-sided market the plagues the majority of innovative ideas. Vidy architected
its embed layer to specifically excel on these 3 planes.

First, whether you understand or believe in blockchain yet or not, as an internet user you
instantly understand how to uncover an embedded vidy by holding down when you see one.

This is our simplicity.

Second, whether you are mindful of it today or not, as a user, you deserve to be compensated.
Period. Without you, there are no ads, there are no publishers, and there are no revenues. You
are tracked, you are analyzed, you are bombarded, and you get nothing in return. Vidy is
flipping the model on its head and sharing ad revenues with the people who make them
happen in the first place, via their hold times. When you hold, you earn, and thanks to NLP
embeds, finally you get to choose what you want to hold and see and what you don’t. By
cutting out the middlemen who bring nothing but complexity, room for manipulation, and

capital drain, Vidy saves money and redistributes it to the users who power the internet with
their participation. This is our financial alignments plan.

Third, whether you use browser X or Y, or whether you hold VidyCoin or no coin, or whether
you subscribe to this publisher or merely browse that one, as a user you will reap immediate
value from embedded vidys by virtue of them being everywhere and them being free.
Similarly, as a publisher, whether you want to monetize with Vidy ads or not, you have the
luxury to embed vidys in your work for free to open your readers up to new world of
entertainment and information. This is our two-sided market killer.

We now have the power to take back control of our lives, our privacy, and our freedom through
innovation. Decentralization is the killer of all monopolies, and it is just a matter of time until
the old guard falls. Just as banking is a seemingly insurmountable industry to eclipse with
cryptocurrencies, but one which we believe undoubtedly will be overtaken in time, so too is
that of the broken advertisement industry. The primary reason for this is that the video
advertising space needs more inventory desperately, and Vidy is uniquely positioned to execute
on this ever-growing problem - one invisible embed layer at a time.

First and foremost we’re calling on all people who believe in fighting the good fight to stand up
and refuse to be taken advantage of anymore. No more illegal data tracking, no more invasive
data warehousing, no more spuriously irrelevant ads, no more profiting on our online lives
without due compensation.

Second we’re calling on all advertisers who are tired of being lied to, tired of having no
recourse for placements purchased at the behest of fraud, tired of an industry that loses $16
billion a year and just looks the other way. You spend billions of dollars optimizing your user
acquisition funnel, optimizing your purchase funnel, optimizing your retention funnel. But why
fight that war when you can bring the ease and convenience of a purchase to the Ist click
instead of the 5th on Vidy’s embed layer.

Third we’re calling on all great publishers who want to enthrall their users, who want to retain
their users, who want to delight their users, and who want to engender even more loyal users.
Vidy is the tool to employ to bring smiles to your readership, to educate your users and
immerse them in a dimension of information remiss in the current online world. Vidy is a place
where you can augment your income with just a few clicks, where you can guarantee revenues
that won’t cannibalize your own UX or screen real estate, and where you can rest assured that
transparency, equity, and placement precision will always prevail.

Advertisers hate the current climate. Publishers hate the current climate. Users hate the current
climate. So it’s time to change the current climate. Join us.
18.1 Definitions

Vidy is the company that builds the Vidy platform, engineers the technology behind its IP
interfaces with advertisers and publishers, and is the entity that has invented OTP and the first
decentralized embed layer. Vidy sits next to the Vidy Foundation as the main operating vehicle
for the Foundation.

Vidy Foundation is the non-profit master entity that is the main vehicle for receiving the
proceeds from the Vidy ICO. Proceeds are allocated out to the Vidy operating company from
the Foundation.

VidyCoin is the decentralized currency that runs the whole Vidy ecosystem. VidyCoin can be
purchased from an exchange that lists it after the ICO, can be earned by users by holding down
on vidys, and is used as the membership key for advertisers to stake with to access one of three
feature tiers on the vidy platform.

VIDY is the abbreviated term for VidyCoin, serving as the symbol that VidyCoin can be
purchased under on all listed exchanges.

Vidylink is the visual demarcation on text that has a vidy embedded into it. Named after the
hyperlink for its similar linking disposition, the Vidylink is different in that it keeps a user on
the same page without a page load, new browser tab, or url change, upon hold event. The UI
for a Vidylink can be customized by publishers from the control dashboard.

Embed layer is the embed layer is a focal consumer-facing component for the Vidy tri-layer
system, and exists as a piece of the application layer, which interfaces with the other layers and
users who interact with embedded vidys.

Application layer is the layer that interfaces directly with users through embedded vidys, and
lives on the publisher website. The application layer lets users hold, watch, earn, authenticate,
and purchase, and tracks hold times to relay to the data layer.

Consensus layer is the layer that determines placement of all Vidy ads via NLP A network of
miners that run an open-source protocol that matches the natural language of live video ads
with available video ad inventory on publisher pages.

Data layer is the layer that enters all records embed placements, hold times, VidyCoin payouts,
VidyCoin staked balances, and VidyCoin transactions into the ledger. The data layer also
warehouses a collection of user data points and containerizes them in a secure smart contract.

Advertiser is any brand or company that signs up to Vidy and uploads a video ad for embed
placement on one of Vidy’s partner publisher pages. Advertisers get a control dashboard to
manage their campaigns, and must stake a certain amount of VidyCoin across three
membership tiers to gain access to specific platform features.
Publisher is any entity, person, or company owning and/or operating a website, webpage, or
mobile app that hosts content. Publishers sign up to Vidy and index their site, thereby making
all text on their pages available for NLP matched video embeds. Publishers get access to their
own control dashboard where they can manage all embeds and see VidyCoin payouts for
connected advertisements.

Titanium tier is the basic advertising tier on the Vidy platform. Advertisers must stake at least
300k VidyCoin to access the Titanium tier. This tier lets advertisers upload unlimited video ads
for unlimited campaigns running concurrently, letting advertisers compare performance metrics
in realtime across different creatives and iterate faster on their go-to campaign strategy.

Gold tier is the middle advertising tier on the Vidy platform. Advertisers must stake at least
700k VidyCoin to access the Gold tier. This tier lets advertisers dictate their preferred
publishers that they are most interested in advertising with, as well as the publishers that they
want to avoid. All preferred placements are based on availability and not guaranteed.

Platinum tier is the top advertising tier on the Vidy platform. Advertisers must stake at least 1
million VidyCoin to access the Platinum tier. This tier gives advertisers everything from
Titanium and Gold, and also lets them display a one-tap purchase button next to their
embedded video ads so that users can instantly buy an advertised product with VidyCoin.

Control dashboard is the control panel where advertisers can upload their video ads, set up
their campaigns, and oversee VidyCoin payouts and performance, and where publishers can
index their sites, manage all embeds across their hosted pages, and track performance analytics
for hold times along with VidyCoin payouts.

User is any visitor online who interacts with a publisher page and/or an advertisement on the
web. These visitors are considered non-authenticated users and therefore not part of the Vidy
ecosystem yet.

Vidy User is any user who has authenticated with Vidy by signing up through the embed layer
or directly through vidy.com. Vidy users collect VidyCoins as they hold, and are able to do
one-tap purchases in the embed layer.

Natural language processing (NLP) is the main method that Vidy employs to place ads to
their matching linked text on publisher pages. NLP is the practice of analyzing parts of speech
such as ngrams, language models, synonym paraphrases, and word vectors to process language
in efficient and efficiently.

One-tap purchase modal (OTP) is a Platinum tier feature available to advertisers who have
staked enough VidyCoin to access it. OTP gives advertisers the ability to display a purchase
button next to their embedded video ad to let users purchase their product right from the spot
using VidyCoin or other checkout methods.
Miners on the Vidy platform are computers that serve as links in the network chain that makes
up the consensus and data layers. Miners earn VidyCoin for solving mathematical equations
using cpu/gpu power, add blocks to the Vidy ledger, place ads via Vidy’s open-source protocol,
and serve as the members of the decentralized governing body that makes the Vidy ad
distribution platform operate.

Fraud detection protocol (FDP) is an open-source protocol that is run by the data layer to
detect fraudulent bot manipulation of hold times on embedded ads. Upon flagging of a
manipulation event, a “marked for review” entry is added to the ledger and the issuing
publisher is alerted and given an opportunity to respond.

19. Solving Market Distortion With Economic Theory

Vidy believes placement and transaction transparency is the answer to quelling fraud in the ad
industry, and this section will apply some economic theory to help demonstrate how a
marketplace’s quantity and quality of trade improves when its transaction platform becomes
more transparent. In economics, information asymmetry theory looks at the decisions in
transactions where one party has an advantage over another party by possessing more
information, or better information. All financial decisions that take place in a marketplace are
made based on the level of information that both transacting parties have, and so this type of
asymmetry creates an imbalance of power in these transactions, and this ends up rippling out
to create an imbalance in the greater market.

A lot of the literature on information asymmetry in recent years was inspired by the first
fundamental theorem of welfare economics written by Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller.
This theorem states that in a competitive economy absent of any externalities, prices will adjust
so that the allocation of resources are optimal in the Pareto sense. One of the primary
assumptions of this theory is that all features of all products traded on the market are equally
observed by all agents, which of course is unrealistic in today’s opaque advertising marketplace.
And according to this theory, when this assumption fails and information possession becomes
asymmetrical, prices become distorted, and the market suffers through a less-than-ideal climate
of resource allocation. The first theorem of welfare can be expanded to state that a market will
always move naturally towards a competitive equilibrium that is Pareto optimal. But the
following conditions must be met in order for it to do so:

i. The Market is regarded as being complete, with no transaction costs because
there is a perfect distribution and reception of information;

ii. There are no monopolies and there is easy entry and exit from this market;

lii. For any original bundle of goods, there is also another bundle of goods
arbitrarily close to the original bundle.

The following is a theorem that elucidates a Pareto optimal to satisfy advertisers and publishers
in the midst of both a competitive equilibrium environment and an asymmetric non-satiating
environment.

Assume that the local non-satiation condition for advertisers is satisfied and [ (x?) (»? , (O)|

is a competitive equilibrium, then the allocation [(x?) ; (v?)) is Pareto optimal.

Let [ a fi (»°), (D ) be a competitive equilibrium; we then show that under the condition of

non-satiation, for each i,u,(x) =u,(x?) implies @(x) > O(x?)

Suppose instead that u,(x) =u,(xP) and Sx) < Sx?)

By following the local non-satiation conditions, we can let {x,,) be a sequence in X, converging
to x such that u;(x,) > ux) =u,(x°),i = 1,2...... Since @ is continuous, this implies that
for all sufficiently large, @(x,) < (x?) , however, in a competitive equilibrium, u,(x,,) > u,(x?)

implies that O(x,) > Ox?)

a
Suppose further that the initial allocation [(x?

l

), (»°), (©)] is not Pareto optimal, then there

is another feasible allocation [(x/), ( y;] such u,(x/) > u(x?) for all i, but with inequality for

some i.Then for some i, u,(x/) > u(x?) implies that D(x?) > G(x). Since © is linear, we

see that for k €i where uj (X;.) = u(x), D2) 2 D2), For | #k where u,(x;) > u(x),

D2) > De?) . Summarizing across all i, this gives of Ds) - » Q(x!) > 2 @(x}) = (Ds ),

i

Since both allocations are feasible, we find that

2 (9) = |B = o( Ex) > o( 5») =2()\ y°) = 220)

This theorem implies that competitive markets will always naturally move toward an efficient
allocation of resources. In the digital advertising ecosystem where centralized profit-driven ad
networks exclusively control the flow of information to both sides of the transaction, fair trade
naturally becomes distorted. As a result, advertisers pay more, get less, and a massive influx of
fraud is induced due to too much demand and unqualified supply.

The Modigliani-Miller theorem concluded that the value of a firm is independent of its financial
structure given the existence of asymmetric information within it. Just as it becomes apparently
important to align the interests of managers and workers with the interests of shareholders so
that information on decisions flows freely within a firm, facilitating that information
permeation in an external structure such as an ad buying marketplace becomes just as
imperative for extended value alignment.

When two parties agree on the trade of goods, and one has more information than the other,
that is considered adverse selection. For example, when an advertiser is unable to know the
true market value of low performing publisher inventory that is marketed and sold as high
performing, this facilitates a value distortion. In the years that followed the baseline economic
theories above, the research around information asymmetry theory and adverse selection
continued to grow with work done by Akerlof in 1970, Spence in 1973, and Rothschild and
Stiglitz in 1976 - all of whom received Nobel Prizes in Economic Science for in 2001.

19.1 Adverse Selection Theory

Adverse selection theory examines the environmental and fiscal forces that allow for a
recalibration of the market according to unobserved quality. Rothschild and Stiglitz explain an
example of this where insurance companies and banks screen their customers with the use of
deductibles and collateral requirements in order to vet them and hedge their bets. Another
example is where sellers often signal the quality of their products by offering
product-warranties to prospective customers. And Spence offers a further example of adverse
selection on the worker side, where workers regularly signal their ability to employers by
getting academic degrees and displaying them prominently.

Market segmentation grows from a host of contracts offered to agents that lead to
self-selection, and ultimately reveal these agents’ private information. This framework induces
careful buyers of an insured product for example to opt for a low premium, high deductible
contract, and careful buyers to feel more comfortable paying a high premium so they can face a

a
low deductible in the event of an accident. Similarly, sellers of high-quality goods want to
charge a higher price in exchange for a one-year warranty to customers because they are
confident in the product they are offering. This is contrasted with sellers of low-quality goods
who would not entertain a policy like this due to the risk-reward ratio being off for their
respective product offering.

Next we expound on the principle of adverse selection by presenting a spin on George Akerlof’s
famous illustration of a car sale with the narrative of advertisements. In this scenario, we
consider advertisers fighting for a single impression in the market. We assume that there are

N + 1 advertisers for this impression, with N random and N(N > 2) = 1. Advertiser i has value
x, for the impression. The value x; is the product of two term: a common value C and a match
value M;. We then interpret C as capturing attributes of the user that are valuable to all
advertisers, such as the income of the user and responsiveness to online advertising. The value
M, captures idiosyncratic components that contribute to the quality of the match for advertiser
i. We then assume that, given N, the M; are drawn from a distributions F;, and that C is
drawn from a distribution G, and that M = (M), ..., My) is independent of C. We then assume
that both match and common values have finite expectations. We use X, and M, to denote the
kth highest value factor, respectively. We assume that advertisers i € {1,...N} (the performance
advertisers) observe their values X, , but not the components C and M;. Meanwhile, advertser 0
(whom we refer to as a brand advertiser) cannot observe X,. The assumption that there is a
single uninformed and multiple informed advertisers is only made for expositional simplicity.

Making use of the revelation principle, we consider a mechanism to be a mapping from the
privately held information by publishers X = X,, ....Xj, to allocation probabilities z and

payment p. For i € {0,...N}, we let z; (X) be the probability that advertiser i expectations are
met, and pi(X ) be advertiser i’s expected payments, given X . For fixed F. and G, given an

allocation rule z , we may define the total surplus from impressions awarded to the brand
advertiser by V,(z) = E[xpzo(X )I.

We may define the surplus from the impressions awarded to the brand advertiser by

N
Ve) = Jel » X,z;,(x)] . We consider objectives that are weighted sums of these two terms. In
i=!

particular, for fixed y > 0, we define V_ = yV,(z) + x (z) where y = 1, this corresponds to
the total efficiency of the allocation. When y is chosen to reflect the relative bargaining power
of the publisher and the brand advertiser, then this objective is proportional to the publisher’s
revenue. However, when y = 0 , and the advertiser has no information of the market then the

overall objective is not met.

19.2 Transparent Information Increases Trade
Jonathan Levi’s Information and Market for Lemons is an illuminating piece that illustrates the

merits of transparency well. First, we can examine a scenario where private information is
traded.

a
Consider that there are three goods in the market: Lemon (w = L), a Melon (w = M) anda
Peach (w=H), and that the seller and buyer have the following values:

l4ifw=L
b= )28ifw=M

42 ifw=H
And

Oifw=L
s=J20ifw=M

40 ifw=H

In this first scenario, the buyer is providing and is seeking a higher value than the seller, despite
them both expecting high quality.

However, if both the seller and the buyer do not have any information, then:
E|b| = 28 > 20 = E[s]
What this denotes is that trade can happen at any price point of between 28 and 20.

Now assume that the seller is partially informed. Since E Q = 28 < 30 = E[s|we{M, H}],
now only the market for lemons is active between price 0 and 14. Adverse selection has
reduced the amount of trade that can take place.

If the seller then becomes more perceptive and gets a grasp on the quality, then melons can be
traded between price 20 and 21:

E|bwetL, M}| =21>20=E[s|w =M]

What this means is that sometimes sellers can provide false information, and trade can
increase, but only up to a certain minimum.

According to Jonathan Levin from his research in 2001, more information that is gleaned by all
agents in the market can increase trade:

E[b|X <x] = Els|X =x]

In this second scenario, we examine the case of trading public information to change the power
dynamics. What would happen when the buyer obtains some of the seller’s information,
thereby lessening the information gap? The buyer and seller have the following values:

lOifw=L
b= )2ifw=M
8SSifw=HA
And

Oifw=L
s= J)20ifw=M
40 ifw=H

Assuming that the seller has perfect information about the quality of the product while the
buyer has none, full trade is possible despite the information asymmetry since

E Q = 41 > 40 = E[s|w =H ]. However, if the good is not a peach, lemons and melons
cannot be traded, since E |b we{L, M }] = 19 < 20 = E[s|w = M |. Trade is therefore seen
to be decreasing with this market distortion of public information. When public information
is absent, and supposing trade will only occur if the seller has a signal X < X* then,

the equilibrium conditions are:

E|b/X <4] ad leila alan = x*
E|b/X < x] SEls|X = xIforx > x*

Transparent and equally distributed information does therefore increase trade if b(w) — s(w) is

descreasing in w.

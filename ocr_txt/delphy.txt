Executive Summary

Making The World More Predictable

1.1 Introduction

Prediction markets will have a profoundly positive impact on the daily lives of our society.
For centuries, the world has relied on methods such as polls, trusted experts and supersti-
tion to predict the outcomes of future events. A prediction market is a platform of mini mar-
kets where groups of individuals make educated, insightful investments about the future
outcome of an event. Although prediction markets have proven several times to be ex-
tremely efficient at removing uncertainty from the world, centralized implementations have
resulted in a fundamental shortcoming - a lack of trust amongst the exchanges, traders and
government entities. Peer-to-peer blockchain technology and token economics resolve
these issues.

1.2 Meet Delphy

Delphy is an open-source, decentralized, prediction market platform built on the Ethereum
platform. Delphy is the first blockchain-based prediction markets company headquartered
in China and will initially launch an end-to-end solution focused on the cryptocurrency mar-
kets. Additionally, the company is finalizing a developer API toolkit for third party organiza-
tions to create many different prediction markets apps.

Delphy's DPY token is required to participate in Delphy’s prediction market platform. The
token escrows the value of the investment on the blockchain which creates slow token ve-
locity (a very positive aspect of blockchain tokens).

1.3 Roadmap

Delphy is on a journey to a fully decentralized prediction market platform. Prediction mar-
kets’ smart contracts and trading volume will create a significant amount of transactions on
the blockchain. As opposed to waiting for the Ethereum blockchain to upgrade, Delphy has
developed proprietary techniques to log the transactions on the Ethereum blockchain which
will enable Delphy to launch a fast-transaction, low-fee prediction market app in Q1 2018 in
the Chinese market and for the international team the following quarter.

1.4 Competitive Advantage

Delphy will have faster transaction speeds, lower fees and faster market closures related to
our competitors such as Augur and Gnosis. Additionally, Delphy will continue to work
toward a fully decentralized prediction market platform and achieve that goal about the
same time Ethereum is able to fully transition to a proof-of-stake network. Due to this strat-
egy, Delphy will have an enormous head start at commercializing prediction markets apps
by having several iterations of the product to perfect an easy-to-use interface, social inter-
actions amongst traders and most importantly a vibrant trading community.

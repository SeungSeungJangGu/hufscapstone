Sugarchain: A PoW blockchain with fast
transactions and accurate block reward halvings
with no rounding errors

Abstract. Sugarchain is the world's fastest PoW blockchain, that has the first Native SegWit
(Bech32) built-in by default. Unlike Bitcoin, Sugarchain has no rounding errors when the block
reward is halved. It launched fairly and follows Nakamoto's one-CPU-one-vote.

1. Introduction

Sugarchain is a decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) digital currency and payment network supported
by an open-source blockchain protocol, launched by Zenny Kim and Volodymyr Biloshytskyi on
August 24, 2019 |]. Through Sugarchain, users can make payments to anyone in the world at the
highest speeds in 5 seconds, and the lowest costs compared to other digital assets. For example,
the transaction speed of Sugarchain is 120 times faster than Bitcoin, 30 times faster than Litecoin
and 12 times faster than Dogecoin.

The Sugarchain Project emerged as an alternative solution to Bitcoin in light of early concerns over
Bitcoin’s wait times in confirming block transactions and rounding errors in block reward halving. By
introducing minor technical modifications to the original Bitcoin source code, Sugarchain allowed for
much faster transaction speeds, even lower processing fees and has the most accurate block
reward halving and total supply than any other digital asset, including Bitcoin. Sugarchain also
launched following the one-CPU-one-vote idea proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto himself, thus
making YespowerSugar GPU and ASIC resistant. It has also launched as being the first blockchain to
have Native SegWit (Bech32) enabled by default.

As one of the successful derivatives of Bitcoin, Sugarchain is establishing its position as the world's
fastest POW blockchain, complementing and reinforcing Bitcoin in purpose, function, and utility,
and challenging our traditional notions of money. The Sugarchain Project has never been funded
through an ICO or premine, making it a fair launch. Sugarchain is an entirely community and
voluntarily driven project, with no external company or funding supporting it apart from community
funding.

5. Exact halving and total supply

Halving is everything about limiting the total supply. Bitcoin is valuable because its total supply has
been strictly limited, unlike traditional currencies. This total supply is controlled only by that halving.
There is nothing else. We made this halving better.

Block reward:

Halving schedule:
© Interval 12500000 blocks (5*8*32) [4] which is approx. 2 years (62,500,000 seconds).

© The total number of times halving will occur is 33 times, over the span of approx. 66 years
(34,375,000 minutes).
Total supply:

© The difference is 0.125 SUGAR . One Satoshi (0.00000001) limitation makes this difference.
In addition, this number is meaningful. FYI: 1 GB = 1073741824 Byte (2°30) .

© The total supply of Sugarchain is around 51 times greater than Bitcoin.

6. one-CPU-one-vote

“31/Oct/2008 Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote" [11]

Satoshi Nakamoto talked about the importance of decentralized mining in his whitepaper. We want
to create a blockchain that anyone can do mining easily without any entry barriers.

¢ CPU mining only

°o YespowerSugar [19] (based on Yespower 1.0.1) is only for Sugarchain, not compatible with
other Yespower coins.

© The minimum difficulty (powlimit) is set low enough for two reasons. The first is to handle
fast block time; The second is to allow mining on slow CPUs.
Mining efficiency [20] ,
© According to the test results, the most efficient is using half of threads ona single CPU.

© YespowerSugar is more suitable for older CPUs, because it is essentially a multi-threading
resistor. Suitable for smartphones and Raspberry Pi.

7. Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm (DAA)

SugarShield-N510 is based on Zcash's modification of Digishield. Unlike the Zcash's modification

version, we use a moving average of 510 blocks (approx. 42.5 minutes) [21] [22], To keep the
block time 5 seconds, SugarShield-N510 adjusts the difficulty level.

¢ The formula of SugarShield-N510 [23]
t = timestamp, h = height,
T = 5 Ctarget block time in seconds),
N = 510 (window size in blocks)

8. FAQ

e Disk space requirements:
© Blockchain size growth is around 1@ MB per day and around 3.65 GB per year.

e Network rules:

© To prevent fraud and timestamp attacks, nodes should be within 70 seconds [24] of
accurate internet time, or they will be banned.

¢ Selfish mining & time warp attack:
© Fraud techniques for manipulating timestamps are already known. We use a future time

limit (FTL) to prevent this. Blocks that differ 6@ seconds !2°! or more from the current
head will be banned. (credit: zawy12)

e Header indexing:

eo Using sha256d in header indexing, the initial synchronization speed is as fast as Litecoin.

Abstract

IDRT is the first crypto-asset which price is intended to mimic the value of Indonesian
Rupiah. IDRT is issued by PT Rupiah Token Indonesia, an Indonesian-based startup. As
an ERC-20 token built on Ethereum, IDRT inherits the speed, security, transparency, and
other desirable characteristics of the Ethereum Blockchain. This combination of the
Ethereum Blockchain and price stability relative to Indonesian Rupiah resulted in a digital

asset that provides consumers with a stable store of value.

The main target customers of IDRT are Indonesian cryptocurrency traders who want to
access global crypto exchanges. PT Rupiah Token might collaborate with third-party
market makers or independent traders in cryptocurrency exchanges to help ensure IDRT
price mimics Indonesian Rupiah. Branding and market education will also help in
establishing market consensus among traders that the value of IDRT tracks Indonesian
Rupiah. However, the ultimate price of Rupiah Token in each cryptocurrency exchanges
will depend solely on market forces of supply and demand. Rupiah Token has no
contractual obligation to perform buyback of IDRT from its holders and does not

represent the indebtedness to the IDRT holders.

Background and Historical Context

A Brief History of Money

Over the vast history of mankind, money has been a key invention that enables humans
to effectively cooperate in producing goods and services, which in turn propels the
economy and civilization forward. Before the existence of money, the people of early
civilizations would barter goods (such as livestock and agricultural produce) they had in
surplus for the ones they lacked. This proved to be cumbersome and inefficient, as the
goods are perishable and there is no standard ‘unit of value’. To solve this issue,
civilizations around the globe invented various forms of physical money - some were
rudimentary coins made of cowrie shells (used in Indonesia’s Batu Islands and West
Africa), while others are more sophisticated metal coins made of bronze, silver, and/or
gold. As civilization and the global economy system advanced, mankind invented even
more convenient forms of money: paper money, credit/debit card, contactless payment

card, and even various digital forms of money.

Money in the 4.0 World

Blockchain as the future medium

Today, we live in a world of unprecedented change and innovation. For the last 20 years,
the rise of distributed computing network called the internet has enabled billions of
humans to connect and share information instantly and securely, with zero consumer cost.
The benefit is immense and immeasurable. For example, the internet has enabled people

from developing countries, such as Indonesia, to access high quality educational

materials such as Software Engineering Videos on Youtube and Free online courses from

Stanford University.

In the last 2 - 3 years, we have seen the rising adoption of QR Code-based payment
systems in Indonesia. These payment systems are operated by digital wallet providers as
Go-Pay and OVO. While these services bring tremendous convenience for Indonesians
to transact locally, there are two weaknesses of this approach. First, all of the balance
records and financial transactions that ever happened on these platforms are stored in a
centralized entity, meaning that a sophisticated, malicious attacker could potentially
infiltrate and manipulate those balances and transactions. Secondly, as closed platforms,
the money stored at any service provider can only be used by users and merchants within
the system, which prevents important use cases such as cross application settlement,

cross-border remittances, and international transactions.

We believe that distributed ledger technology, or blockchain, will bring the next step in
the evolution of money. Just as the internet allowed for borderless and instantaneous
movement of information, blockchain technology will allow us to exchange value and

transact with one another in the same way: instantly, globally, securely and at low cost.

Digital assets such as Bitcoin is too volatile

We have seen that throughout history, money can take various forms and shapes. Every

asset class that can act as money needs to fulfill three main functions:

1. as ameans of exchange
2. asa standard unit of account

3. asastable store of value

The Bitcoin boom and bust in 2017 - 2018 period have shown us that the prices of non-
collateralized crypto assets are notoriously volatile. Even today, we believe that for the
foreseeable future, Bitcoin and similar crypto assets are likely to remain more volatile
than well-managed national currencies or gold. Such volatility might be interesting for
speculative investors and day traders, but it makes the asset unable to be a stable store
of value. For money to exist in the blockchain, we need an alternative class of asset that

can maintain a relatively stable value.

Designing Crypto that is suitable for

Indonesians

Basics

RupiahToken (IDRT) is the first crypto-asset which price is intended to mimic the value of
Indonesian Rupiah. IDRT is issued by PT Rupiah Token Indonesia, an Indonesian-based
startup. As an ERC-20 token, IDRT combines the speed, security, transparency, and other

desirable characteristics of the Ethereum Blockchain.

PT Rupiah Token might collaborate with third-party market makers or independent
traders in cryptocurrency exchanges to help ensure IDRT trades at value close to
Indonesian Rupiah. Branding and market education will also help in establishing market
consensus among traders that the value of IDRT tracks Indonesian Rupiah. However, the
ultimate price of Rupiah Token in each cryptocurrency exchanges will depend solely on
market forces of supply and demand. Rupiah Token has no contractual obligation to
perform buyback of IDRT from its holders and does not represent indebtedness or

debenture to IDRT holders.

Benefits and Strengths of IDRT

e IDRT is built on the Ethereum blockchain, which gives it the inherent security and
transaction immutability of Ethereum.

e IDRT follows ERC-20 token standard, which means it is very easy to integrate and
inherently compatible with many existing Ethereum-based applications.

e All transactions are executed according to the rules of smart contract, which
eliminates human error.

e The security of IDRT smart contract has been audited and verified by CertiK, a
world-class Smart Contract Auditor. IDRT is ready to be listed for all exchanges

around the world

Tradeoffs of IDRT

e Aswith all ERC-20 tokens, transaction confirmation follows the speed of Ethereum
network (about 1 - 3 minutes). This is much faster than Bitcoin, but still slower than
ideal user experience.

e As part of the Ethereum blockchain protocol, all transactions in the Ethereum
network requires the transaction initiator to pay “gas” fees in the form of Ether
(ETH), the native crypto-asset of the Ethereum blockchain. This “gas” cannot be
paid in IDRT or any other ERC-20 tokens. However, this trade-off may one day be
resolved with side chain/sharding technology, such as Plasma and Raiden
Network.

e The gas fees required by the Ethereum blockchain network varies depending on
the load / congestion of the network. As a rough estimate, typical transfer costs
around 0.0005 ETH, which is $0.07 USD or 1000 Indonesian Rupiah at the time of

writing.

Use-case: Crypto-currency Trading

As with all ERC-20 tokens, IDRT usage requires at least a basic familiarity of using
Ethereum. Users need to at least know how to use an ERC-20 compatible Ethereum
wallet, and hold at least a very small amount of ETH to transact IDRT. Because of that
knowledge barrier, the ideal adopters of IDRT would be existing players in the crypto-

asset industry.

The main purpose of IDRT is to facilitate crypto-asset trading. Indonesian crypto traders
need to exchange their volatile digital assets to crypto with a better price stability. With
IDRT, Indonesian traders now have the option to convert their volatile crypto into a more
stable token (IDRT) with respect to Indonesian Rupiah. Not only that, if IDRT is accepted

or listed in multiple exchanges, Indonesian traders can trade between exchanges

Beyond cryptocurrency trading, there is chance that IDRT will enable a new class of
exciting applications from the developer community. We open source our code to allow
developers to create new and exciting projects that can integrate easily with IDRT.
Developing a common standard in an open way will sour developers to work with code
that is not controlled by any one party, and in the process raising the standard of security
and diversity of developers/ applications being built with it. While we may not know what
kind of application may emerge, we believe IDRT can be used in future Ethereum-based

applications that wants to target Indonesian market as users.

Transparency and trust remains the core offering of the blockchain from day one.
We believe a future where existing financial players, blockchain native projects, and
government agencies can coexist to foster an open financial system that support

frictionless and safe transfer of value, both for consumers and businesses.

Detailed Technology and Operations

Ethereum and ERC-20 Token Standard

Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain that allows software programs, called Smart
Contracts, to be written and executed on the blockchain. ERC-20 is a standard on the
Ethereum blockchain that defines a common list of rules that all Ethereum tokens must

adhere to.

We will not attempt to explain the entire Ethereum and ERC-20 Token standard on this
paper because such discourse will be too long. Instead, we invite readers to read some

of the following resources to learn more:

1. https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook

2. https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper#notes

3. https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md

Security of IDRT Tokens and Smart Contract

Ethereum Blockchain is tamper-proof

Similar to Bitcoin, past transactions in Ethereum are final and can never be altered. As of
this writing, there are currently around 8,000 Ethereum nodes running worldwide. To
“hack” and alter data / state in the Ethereum network, a malicious actor need to have

more than 51% of the computing power of those nodes, which is highly improbable.

Ownership of IDRT Tokens are directly in users’ hands

Unlike traditional e-wallet applications where the issuer holds the balance of each users
inside the issuer's centralized system, we do not hold custody of users’ IDRT tokens.
IDRT tokens are owned by users in their own wallets, because users will control their

own private keys (the ‘password’ that signifies ownership of assets on blockchain).

IDRT Smart Contract has passed Certik Audit

Security is always on the top of our minds, and our Smart Contract has been audited by

CertiK (https://certik.org/) to be secure.

Testing Summary

PASS

CERTIK believes this
smart contract passes security
qualifications to be listed on
digital asset exchanges.

Multi-signature design reduces single point of failure

We only hire the best, trustworthy people, and we believe there are no malicious actor(s)

inside our company. However, we believe we still need to mitigate risk and ensure the
© RupiahToken \

security of our internal operations by not allowing a single point of failure to exist. This is
achieved using multi-sig smart contract design. During IDRT smart contract deployment
to Ethereum blockchain, we established one address as the Owner and three addresses
as Administrator. These addresses are each controlled by separate hardware wallets. Any

critical operations require at least two signatures, as follows:

1. Two signatures are required for minting up to 100 million IDRT
2. Two signatures are required to burn IDRT tokens at a pre-defined burn address
(i.e. we cannot burn tokens located outside of that specific address)
3. Two of three admins PLUS owner signatures are required for :
1. Minting above 100 million IDRT in a single transaction.
2. Transferring the token management of the IDRT ERC20.

3. Replace, add, or remove an admin.
Signature of transactions happen in an offline, air-gapped computer

To enhance the security of IDRT operations even further, all transactions that interact with
IDRT smart contract (such as minting, burning, etc) are done in an offline, air-gapped
computer. We then use a separate device to broadcast/transmit the signed transaction
to the Ethereum blockchain. As such, the computer used to compose the signed

transactions are safe from external attacks.

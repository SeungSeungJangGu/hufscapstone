INTRODUCTION

In several dimensions, the current centralized map system of the world is flawed and is ripe for disruption.
Blockchain technology — with its ability to facilitate global collaboration in an open and secure manner — has
huge potential to disrupt the status quo by underpinning the birth of a new, open, decentralized map economy
that will appeal to the mass market.

We have pioneered a new open map architecture, the Hyperion ecosystem, based on the our widely adopted
open map technology and latest advancements of Blockchain technology. This ecosystem is designed to
reward everyone with a share in the wealth they create and will ensure privacy is protected whilst hosting a
new generation of decentralized applications requiring quality map services.

This paper outlines our vision for the birth of this new transformative ecosystem capable of addressing the
needs of 10 billion users and 100 billion devices. This will lead to a much more egalitarian, prosperous society
where everyone will get a share in the wealth they create.

The Power of Place
“Mobility is the fundamental essence of intelligence...[ _]. If you want to move, you must memorize and generalize.”
~ Dr Qi Lu, ex Baidu COO, CES 2017 Keynote

To better understand the significance of the Hyperion ecosystem, one must first comprehend the significance
of location data. Did you know that 80% of all business data has a location component to it!? This is not
surprising given that maps constitute the building block of mobility, providing the memory block that underpin
mobility for people, loT devices and robots.

Some of the far-reaching impact of location data are summarized below:

1. Location data is a fundamental element for enriching business data sets with no obvious links and helps
visualize business data in familiar ways, providing more in-depth analytics. This enables companies to
make smarter and more informed business decisions.

2. Location data fuels innovation. In services that are particularly location-aware, such as Uber and Waze,
accurate location and routing are fundamental to the value they provide to users.

8. Location data and analytics has helped advance the advertising technology and marketing space. This
aids with better customer profiling and therefore targeting, and extends beyond just location-based mobile
advertising.

With smartphone penetration rates on the rise, proliferation of location infrastructure, as well as the loT tipped
to go mainstream within a few years, location data will only continue to be a growing component underpinning
all business data. To put that into perspective, the global market of location analytics worths 16.34 Billion USD
by 20212 alone not including the use of map services.

As the fundamental building block of mobility, maps should be and remain pervasive, accurate and privacy-

current map system is flawed as elaborated in the following:

Location data is widely distributed and long-tailed, which means that the production and maintenance of a

Vision and Proposed Solution

"Making maps together means piecing together collective experiences, discovering patterns, and arriving at
a collective understanding of the root causes of these shared experiences.”
~ Eli Moore and Catalina Garz6n,

Hyperion organically integrates innovations of three important dimensions, coined as the Hyperion Trinity of

map technology, economy and society structures, to eventually achieve a sustainable and self-governed map

economy of the world. People are empowered to build map technology, share economical return and govern

map communities. High level dynamics of the Hyperion Trinity is illustrated in figure 1-1.

- Crowd-share to establish a sustainable decentralized map economy, in which map services fees are
distributed to HDLR owners accordingly by smart contract, i.e., HDLR dividend;

- Crowd-govern to reach consensus on technology and social-economic transition with delegated
governance, i.e., HDLR voting. The Hyperion global community is consisted of multi-level regional
communities governed by HDLR holders delegates of respective regions.

Technology and Service Architecture (figure 1-2)

- Protocol Layer: the Hyperion Protocol Network is a global network of Hyperion Protocol Nodes with
MapChain (Hyperion Blockchain), smart contract, and trusted distributed storage. MapChain, optimized for
location data, supports cross-chain communication for enhanced interoperability and smart contract for
extensibility. MapChain natively integrates our innovative Spatial Consensus Protocol (SCP) to reach
consensus of static location data (map) and dynamic location data (localization) in a secure and verifiable
manner. MapChain employs BFT + dPOS as block producing consensus algorithm to support scalable map
services and enforce a consistent delegated governance structure of the Hyperion community;

- Service Layer: this layer includes full-stack map services with tight integration with MapChain. Specifically, it
includes map production service (dMapper), map service (dMap) and location data intelligence platform
(Hyperion Marketplace). Users can stake HYN (pay-by-inflation) to access dMapper and dMap services, and
spend HYN (pay-by-fee) for Hyperion Marketplace services;

Confidential
Hyperion White Paper v1.15 Page 8 of 28

- Ecosystem Layer: Location-based services (LBS), such as location-based social network, advertisement
and gaming, accrue value to HDLR. Hyperion will collaborate with a wide spectrum of LBS to enrich the
Hyperion ecosystem. To demonstrate the full power of Hyperion services, Hyperion will develop example
LBS, e.g., a consuming-facing map service named Titan and a location-based game.

Mission and Vision - Spatial Consensus and Autonomy over Digital Location Right

Time and space attributes are meta data. It implies that all services happen on the map. The invention of clock
provides human with the consensus of time, i.e. the Temporal Consensus. However, the ability to correctly
understand our surrounding by community, i.e. the Spatial Consensus, is constrained due to centralized
control and censorship. Our mission is to provide Spatial Consensus driven map of the world.

The need of accurate and precise Spatial Consensus, together with the highly distributed nature of map data,
demands a decentralized Relation of Production for map economy. We envision a future in which people have
autonomy over digital location - people are incentivized with Hyperion Digital Location Right reward to
contribute underlying map utilities, and use their digital location rights to share economy benefit and govern
important community transitions in a sustainable manner.

Brief History of Hyperion

Our mission to decentralize the map economy began in 2013. Dr. Isaac Zhang, upon commencing his PhD,
realized the partiality and shortcomings inherent in the centralized model of maps. Curious to solve this
problem, he began researching on a model of global open mapping crowdsourced by its people, for the
people, and powered by innovative technologies. To that effect, he founded Mapxus (Maphvie Technology
Limited) in 2016. Already, Mapxus has become the largest open indoor mapping platform in the world, serving
various industries ranging from hospitality, government, medical, and commercial sectors.

Inspired by the emerging token economy and the possible paradigm shift enabled by blockchain technology,
he envisioned for a map system that redistributes the excessive power away from centralized authorities.
Realizing the inherent limitations of existing centralized map services and open map services, Mapxus together
with other Hyperion founders decided to take it one step further, designing a global consensus-driven protocol
with robust social-economic structure that will incentivize open mapping in a manner that is quality assured,
self-sustaining and self-governed. That leads to the birth of Hyperion, the Autonomous Map that includes
much more than open data and technology, but also a sustainable and self-regulated social-economic
structure. Hyperion aims to provide autonomy over digital location, enabling everyone to build collaboratively
and use better map services in an open and secure manner.

Determined to realize the vision and effect change, Hyperion was born in November 2017. Hyperion founders
quickly assembled a dedicated and passionate team who shared a similar vision and were driven to upheave
the current centralized model of mapping. Already, the Hyperion team has sought — and continues to seek —
the best minds in token economics, blockchain technology, map technology and open data marketplaces. It is
upon this robust and determined foundation that Hyperion will soon emerge as the thought leader and
strongest advocate in open mapping.

HYPERION MAP SERVICES

Primitives of Map

In an abstract sense, a map is a symbolic depiction emphasizing the relations amongst elements of some
space. The map we use everyday generally refers to geographic maps that describe the distribution of
location-determined information in relation to physical space. In the context of Hyperion, a map is a collection
of location-indexed information.

Maps can be broadly categorized into physical map and semantic map, which represents maps of physical
quantities such as visual and wireless signal, and maps of usage data, respectively. Some examples of these
two types of data are shown in the Table 1. A branch of Maps is built for human, i.e. consumer maps for
people to find place, find people and find things. consumer maps suffer from map data that are incomplete
(large unmapped public indoor space) and inaccurate (fast-changing data especially for PO). Another branch
of maps is built for robot, i.e., HD Map normally by hybrid SLAM technology4. HD MAP are increasingly more
important due to the wide spawn of robotic devices such as drones and self-driving vehicles. Primary
challenges of HD Map are the sheer cost of map production and lack of an open global database (500 billion
to 1 trillion miles driven data to train self-driving model). The OneMap alliance& of self-driving vehicles suppliers
proposed to make a harmonized global HD Map database for pervasiveness, openness and cost reduction.

Location Service and Tradable Data

The Services layer is consisted of three main modules, namely dMapper, dMap and Hyperion Marketplace. All
location data generated within the Service layer are tradable. We coin these data as Location-Tradables. The
overall service flow (Figure 2) are as follows:

- Registered mappers can use dMapper (decentralized mapping tools) for mapping to capture raw physical
location data, the Captured Location-Tradables, submit to dMapper to process into the Map-ready Location-
Tradables, which are ready for Map use. Mappers have full ownerships of the data they produced - that they
can set them as open, private data for sale or regulated data for special use cases.

- dMap (decentralized map services) consumes Map-ready Location-Tradables and publishes full range of

map services such as routing, map search and visualization. dMap will record user usage data, the Usage
Location-Tradables, upon the consent of users and store for later usage.

- All Location-Tradables are persisted in Hyperion Protocol Network securely in a privacy-preserved manner.
The Hyperion Marketplace publishes Location-Tradables for user to query using the native MapChain Smart
Contract (MSC) built into Hyperion Marketplace. Hyperion Market also exposes programmable native
contracts and high-level applications such as a configurable location-based advertisement platform.

dMapper

Decentralized Mapping Services, dMapper, is a mapping tool suit for fast mapping by everyone. The idea is to
make mapping simple - the simpler mapping is for everyone with consumer electronic devices such as
Smartphone and drones, the more people can provider map data and thus the more complete and updated of
the map database. dMapper has a dMapper HD version for High Definition Map construction for robotic
devices e.g. self-driving cars and drones with integrated mountable mapping device on cars and drones.

Token Model

Map data produced by dMapper are recored as transaction (Map Block) on chain, owned by the mappers
themselves. The Map Block content describe the map data and the metadata of the Map Block. The value of
Map Block is determined automatically if the contents of Map Block can be validated by algorithm, or
evaluated using crowd curated model if otherwise. Non-validated Map Block contents will be separated into a
new database branch and would not be merged into main branch until positively validated.

The crowd curated model, Map Block Test, is a generalized version of A/B test with time duration constraints -
that dMap serves different branches map data for different users to rate at the scene. Users rates are collected
over time to proof the test of time of the Map Block content. With enough user rates for the Map Block Tests,
system will compute a value of the Map Block for reference of token distributions later on.

Mappers can be paid in two schemes: (1) instant payment contract that transfers tokens to mapper for data
buy-and-sell, which is equivalent to transferring ownership of the Map Block to others by signing on the buy-
and-sell contract (2) Deferred Sharing Contract (DSC) that grants mappers an ongoing share of the dMap
token revenue based on the content of their Map Block. DSC is valid until the Map Block contents are
invalidated afterward (Change of environment). DSC model incentives people to contribute Map Block on the
early stage. All of functions related to Map Block evaluation, ownership transferring and payment schemes are
all implemented on MSC for self-regulating and sustainable mapping on the globe.

Primary Features
dMapper are mainly characterized by following features:

- Unified Open Mapping Schema: dMapper will devise a flexible and effective map data representation
compatible to Open Street Map (OSM) schema.

Decentralized mapping by everyone: dMapper features are accessible by consumer-grade electronic devices
e.g. smartphones, personal computers and drones. Full spectrum quality mapping: dMapper is simple to use
and most of the mapping process are automated. All data types included in the Table 1 can be produced
using dMapper.

Larger open mapping community: dMapper connects with OSM mapping community - over 4 million
registered mappers and large ecosystem players like Mapbox, Mapxus and Mapillary.

Confidential
Hyperion White Paper v1.15 Page 12 of 28

dMap

Decentralized Map Services, dMap, deliver full range of map services (indoor and outdoor seamless
localization, search and routing etc.) for consumers, enterprise and robots. dMap can be accessed in forms of
API and SDKs (web, mobile, unity) or purpose-built hardwares. dMap has a dMap HD branch for robotic
devices such as drone and self-driving cars. Hyperion will develop a consumer-facing map application, Titan,
to demonstrated the use cases and exploit the underlying power of native MSC.

Token Model

Users need Pulse to consume dMap services. Pulse is generated monthly, with a dynamic ratio, based on the
amount of HYN users stake for dMap. Unused Pulse by the end of the month would be emptied, and
excessive use of Pulse will halt the service with a 5 day extension for users to increase the stake for dMap.

dMap meters the use of following resources and compute the Pulse consumptions accordingly:
- The number of transaction recorded on MapChain;

- The number of API calls grouped by map functions used;

Primary Features
dMap are mainly characterized by following features:

- Open and secure service: We will open source dMap, both client side to back-end codes on MSC. Privacy
related service such as localization, location-based search and recommendation will be implemented as
native MSC to fully exploit the privacy-preserved features of MapChain. MapChain supports reproducible
and verifiable proof of timestamped localization, the SpaceTime Verification (STV), that provides zero
knowledge proof of location and allow data owner to validate it afterward. Example uses of SpaceTime
Verification include verifying the location attribute of location-based comment to avoid fake comment, and
verifying the physical presence of users to claim location-based coupons or received location-based
advertisements .

- Pervasive and accurate maps: Map data are intrinsically distributed and long-tailed. With incentivized
decentralized mapping with help of dMapper, map data are expected to be more complete and updated.

- Aligned incentives: With the consent of dMap users, dMap will publish usage data as Location-Tradables to
Hyperion Marketplace for monetization in a secure and privacy-preserved manner. dMap users will received
token rewards upon existence of completed transaction of their usage data. For example, a third party can
registers a deferred, conditional and token-staked MSC for location-based advertising. The MSC is
completed automatically if a SpaceTime Verification of fitting target is generated and token staked in the
MSC will be distributed as a transaction to the viewer of the advertisement.

Hyperion White Paper v1.15 Page 13 of 28

Hyperion Marketplace

Hyperion Marketplace can be considered as a collection of location services other than those included in
dMap (map usage) and dMapper (mapping). It is built on top of native MSC and provides interface for users to
interact via browser or programmatically via API or MSC. Hyperion Marketplace mainly provides two broad
streams of services: (1) location data: curation and trading of Location-Tradables; (2) location intelligence:
location-based advertising, geo-fencing, real-time tracking and triggered events etc.

Design principles of Hyperion Marketplace are:
- Discoverability: the ability to identify, promote and curate location data and intelligence;
- Transactability: the ability to reach transactional agreement of data and service;

- Verifiability: the ability to prove that data were untampered, computation were correctly executed and
transactions were completed

Token Model

Token models of Hyperion Marketplace services vary from case to case. However, there are guiding principles
- that for transaction of ownership transfer (e.g. buying Location-Tradables), the new owner should pay-by-fee,
and that for transactions of service usage, the user can pay-by-fee (e.g. advertising) or use-by-staking (e.g.
data analytics). The actual token model depends on the legal contract accompanied in the MSC performing
the transaction.

Primary features:
Primary features of Hyperion Marketplace services include:
- Location data: Provides discovery, analytics, curation and trading tool suits of Location-Tradables.

- Location intelligence: Provide a collection of native MSC of location-based intelligence and events support.
Example usages include location-based advertising platform, location-based gaming and location-triggered
events;

- Transparency on Blockchain: Hyperion Marketplace is built on native MSC so all transactions are easy to
audit and verifiable by all parties.

HYPERION PROTOCOL NETWORK

Design Principles and Discussions

Hyperion is built to underpin a global decentralized map economy in which interests of stakeholders are well-
aligned and everyone has the autonomy to access the utility of Hyperion, that is, pervasive and autonomous
location and map services. The overall design goal of Hyperion Protocol Network (HPN) is to power the
aforementioned location and map services in an open, censorship-resistant and fault-tolerant manner.

Usability & Performance

Map services should be low-latency, low-cost, high-availability and secure and it is challenging to provider the
service level at global scale. As reported’, Tencent serves over 50 billion localization requests per day for over
600 millions users in various contexts such as social network and car hailing services etc. With linear scaling
assumption to 2 billion® global users, the number of localization requests exceeds 165 billions a day, equivalent
to roughly 2 million Transaction Per Second (TPS) if all requests run on Smart Contracts. It also reports that
nearly one third of searches of Google are location based queries’.

Extensibility & Interoperability

Map is the greatest common denominator of location-based applications such as Uber and Foursquare etc.
Pokemon Go is a prime example of location-based service built on primitive map data. Other applications may
want to develop location-triggered events based on dMap services. It requires HPN to be able to support
partners to flexibly program Smart Contract based on the native location functionalities implemented as Native
Smart Contracts (NSC) that can be called as inline function in other Smart Contracts.

For interoperability with other native Blockchain, HPN supports cross-chain communication which requires the
ability to bi-directionally verify existence of transactions in a provable secure manner. The cross chain design
will also enhance system throughput by side-chains or off-chain channels via secure state synchronization
across chains.

Decentralization & Governance

Scaling Blockchain system is difficult in a full decentralization and secure setting as discussed in the
Blockchain scalability trilemma?®, albeit with years of efforts in both academic and industry down the path.
MapChain, the native Blockchain system of HPN, is of no exception. Latest open research results such as
Elastico'!, ByzCoin'2 and RsCoin's exhibit different trade-off preferences of the Trilemma setting.

However, from the perspective of HPN, decentralization is not an objective itself, but a feature for other system
design goals: censorship resistance, open participation and fault-tolerance. Importantly,
decentralization is a spectrum and increased degree of decentralization often incurs higher costs, as
demonstrated in the sheer cost of mining Bitcoin. We consider having each and every transaction validated by
a large node network is both unrealistic and unnecessary. MapChain scales throughput and reduces latency
by using only as much decentralization as necessary to maintain useful levels of openness, censorship
resistance and fault tolerance.

Moreover, architectural decentralization does not necessarily guarantee political decentralization’ - they are
often misaligned that the block production in Bitcoin and Ethereum, albeit with complete architectural
decentralization protocol design, is far more concentrated than commonly thought's. The inherent political
structure of Blockchain network should be taken into design consideration that demands a coherent high-level
design of technology and a fitting social-economical structure with proper incentive scheme to mobilize and
regulate collective community behaviors. Importantly, a formal governance process is required to prevent
informal governance devolving the network into gridlocks, e.g., forking or inability to upgrade protocol.

To sum up, governing design principles of HPN include:

- Usability & performance: support billions of users with low-latency, low-cost and highly available services with
native security and privacy-preserved features;

- Extensibility & Interoperability: support Smart Contract with native location functionality and secure and
provable cross-chain communication;

- Decentralization & Governance: achieve long-term censorship resistance, open participation and fault
tolerance via coherent and organic design of technology and social-economic structure.

MapChain Design & Optimization

MapChain is built on top of academic-grounded works and integrate latest industrial best practice, protocol
design and system tooling from continuous rigorous experimentations. Important design decisions of
MapChain are as follows:

Block Producing Nodes & MapChain Core Network

BFT + dPOS. BFT is for improving the robustness and shortening the time to finality (1s) and dPOS is for
providing a incentivized, liquid and representative model for the requirements of global token holder suffrage.
The model provides performance level of federated chains while ensuring open participation and censorship
resistance by token voting of eligible delegates.

Keepers of the Hyperion Protocol Community will host a global distributed MapChain Core Network of 15
active Block Producers and 30 idle Block Producers in case the failure of active Block Producers. The
MapChain Core network is built on a secure underling Secure Communication Layer, an protocol agreed on
and maintained keepers to provide secure and fast communication. The idea is to shield block producing
nodes from potential attacks and decrease the attack surface to a minimum required level (fully meshed, P2P
private tunnel and etc.).

Other System Nodes & MapChain Access Network

In addition to the MapChain Core Network, keepers will also host a MapChain Access Network of auxiliary
systems to provide an extra security layer of request filtering and buffering, and a place for block producers to
establish their credentials to the community. Public request to block producers are all filtered by a hardened
API Node with private and secure communication to block producing nodes. API Nodes need to be protected
from network attacks, e.g., DDoS attacks, and have sufficient processing and networking capability to
preprocess and queue public requests to the block producers.

MapChain Access Network also include Query Nodes and Validating Nodes. The Query Node maps
blockchain state into traditional database for scalable read access and easy maintainability and resolve the
need for applications to run through the blockchain full history themselves. The Validating Node tracks the
validity of transactions on blockchain signed by blocker producers and report suspicious behaviors for the
community for token reward.

Parallelization and Cross Chain Verification

Parallel chain is an effective pattern for scaling transaction throughput by dividing transactions to different
chains to process separately. Fast cross chain transaction validation is enabled by Light Client Validation. Light
client, implemented as a Native Smart Contract, is baked into the protocol level to allow cross-chain
transaction verification without having to process the entire blockchain. Light client verifies the existence of

Confidential
Hyperion White Paper v1.15 Page 17 of 28

transactions on other chain and take actions accordingly. With a 1s transaction finality, a cross chain action
can finish in 3s.

MapChain employs message based'® architecture rather than a state based architecture to improve system
scalability. It is easier to parallelize transactions if Blockchain is designed as a log of actions combined with
deterministic logic for generating and verifying states, than to record a log of state changes on Blockchain.
States can be replayed and verified by going through the message history.

Protocol Level Account Support

In addition to general system specifications, such as low latency, high availability and security, protocol layer
user friendly account support is crucial for success of decentralization applications. Features include human-
readable username, recoverable accounts and fine-grained function control. Users have complete control of
their own private keys, while also having recourse in the case that their keys are stolen by invoking multi-
signature account restoring procedures.

Easy Upgrade and Bug Fix

A preferable design pattern is to separate bare-bone block producing logic and other native functions e.g.
token, delegated voting. By moving non block producing logics to NSC, the community has greater flexibility
to update the network without a hard fork. Code update, agreed by the community, can be propagated to the
main net automatically by enforcing an on-chain governance pattern and therefore allowing the system to
evolve faster.

Transaction Compression

Reducing the size of transactions can improving system throughput and block size, reduce time for state
synchronization and reduce cost of Blockchain operation. Examples include the Smart Contract codes, ABI
specification and large text or media content. The general idea is to prune contents that are irrelevant to
Blockchain states after a block is immutable. This proves that the content was once known without the need
to store the contents on chain forever. Segregated Witness can used to keep large contents as segregated
data while putting the digital digest of data as hash on Blockchain.

System Optimization

High-performance message streaming is an important feature of high throughput distributed systems. We will
refer to the implementation of Reliable Messaging to Millions of Users 17 to a solution to handle millions of

concurrent connections and support a reliable notification service despite server failures and network
disconnections.

Smart Contracts & Persistence

MapChain supports high-performance Smart Contract with tight integration with location Oracles. Location
Oracle index data with optimized location-based schema and provides trusted data feed for Smart Contracts
on MapChain. Smart contracts are registered on MapChain and support atomic, inline and deferred actions.
Smart Contracts are pure and safe without side-effects that do not share working memory be default.

Contracts are written with Web Assembly Virtual Machine (WASM) and compiled into a canonical bytecode
format that nodes can retrieve and execute. Each Smart Contract must be accompanied by a Contract that
defines the legally binding terms and conditions of the contract. It is important to note that MapChain is a
message-based system with deterministic logic. All non-deterministic Smart Contract behaviors such as
floating point operations are needed to be sanitized. For example, Smart Contract library should include
support for software determined floating point number generator.

Native MSC is broadly classified into four streams: (1) system: system level behavior such as token transfer,
account management, messaging and light client validation etc.; (2) real-time location: continuous tracking or
event driven models such as geo-fencing and location-based advertisement; (3) data management: curate
location data via Token Curation Registry (TCR)'8 or querying location-based data and spatial aggregation
queries; (4) cryptography primitive: Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKSNARK) and Secure Multiparty Computation etc.
(2) and (3) both require tight integration with location oracles feeding trusted data securely.

MapChain provides a persisting API to store states across sessions - contract can share states among actions
with flexibly schema for data abstraction. Logs of produced blocks are stored locally on the block producing
nodes and synced over the block producer network via the native state synchronization mechanism of
MapChain. Large files like images and map data are stored in fault-tolerant distributed object storage and
database. Data in the distributed database and file storage are synchronized and verified across Block
Producer keep network via a oracle network consensus layer. Contracts can query location data via the
interface of location Oracles for trusted and verifiable computation in a secure manner.

PROGRESS AND ACHIEVEMENT

In year 2016, Mapxus was founded with the vision to build a global open indoor map platform via
crowdsourcing, enabled by technology innovations to make mapping simple, for everyone. The vision of
Mapxus is best illustrated in figure 3 that a child can be an eligible mapper using Mapxus’s tools and build
useful maps as shown in Figure 4.

Already, to our Knowledge, Mapxus has become the largest crowdsource open indoor mapping platform of the
world with exemplary use cases in many sectors such as healthcare, first responder, commercials and
location-base gaming. Mapxus extends the previous research works since year 2013 and serves as the
launchpad of Hyperion - to ensure technology superiority in map services and drive early growth of global map
communities.

Technology and Product

Mapxus provides technology in two dimensions: mapping and map use, which are the basis of dMapper and
dMap of Hyperion. With the mapping tools, anyone with smartphone is empowered to become a
cartographer, capable of producing quality map data in full spectrum: vectorial, signal and visual data. Raw
data are captured and processed with the mapping engine in the cloud to produce useable maps and related
map features.

Mapxus is one of a few companies with full spectrum of map services, covering indoor and outdoor areas.
Map data can be accessed via cross platform SDKs (IOS, Android and Web) providing map services such as
seamless positioning, map rendering, search, routing and panoramic visual view.

Growth of Data Coverage

Since Mapxus released the mapping tool suite to partners on Aug 2017, volume of data started to surge and
now already has covered indoor areas of over 1300 buildings with over 60 million square meters space
coverage (Figure 5), over a few countries and regions in Asia (Figure 6). The primary focus of the first year
growth to cover Asia market and dominate a few developed regions (e.g. Hong Kong) for city-scale open map
demonstration. The market of indoor maps for consumer applications is still a blue ocean. To illustrate, Mapxus
has mapped 728 commercial buildings in Hong Kong - about 10 times as the indoor maps found on Google
Map (about 70 on June 2018).

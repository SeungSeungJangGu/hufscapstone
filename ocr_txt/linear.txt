Linear Whitepaper v1.1
A Cross-Chain Compatible, Decentralized Delta-One Asset Protocol with Unlimited Liquidity

ABSTRACT

Linear Finance (“Linear”) is a non-custodial, cross-chain compatible, delta-one asset protocol. Linear’s
long term DeFi vision is to increase inclusiveness and democratize access to investment assets (digital and
traditional). Tremendous value exists in the ability for investors to easily and quickly invest, save fees, and
secure assets at fair market value. Linear combines substantial technical experience from numerous crypto
projects with extensive financial experience in exotic and structured assets from traditional global asset
management firms to bring to market one of the first DeFi projects built upon Ethereum with cross-chain
compatibility. Linear will allow users to build and manage spot or portfolio exposures with a slew of
innovative digital and traditional financial products. Linear is backed by our Ethereum-based Linear Token
(LINA) with synthetic assets built on other EVM compatible chains first and other prominent blockchains
in the long run, making the staking, investing, and redemption process easier, quicker and with substantially
lower transaction fees whilst maintaining access to the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem.

Linear is a non-custodial cross-chain compatible DeFi protocol with unlimited liquidity and serves in the
creation of synthetic assets (Liquids) with zero slippage. The backbone to Linear’s protocol is our
collateralized debt pool, backed by our Linear token (LINA), and eventually other digital and real world
assets. Users who have provided collateralized assets to the debt pool are able to “build” Linear USD
(CUSD) which can then be used to purchase synthetic assets (Liquids) on our exchange. The collateralized
assets are subsequently pooled to enable instantaneous liquidity and serve as a counterparty. LINA — will
also be a governance token enabling holders to vote on distribution models, assets to be listed, oracle
selection, pledge ratio etc. LINA holders within the debt pool will obtain pro-rata fees from the building of
Liquids.

The LINA token will adopt an inflationary model to enhance staking incentives and will have liquidity
mining programs to encourage usage of the exchange and stability of the pool. Synthetization of assets will
focus on cryptocurrencies, commodities and, more importantly, traditional assets such as market indices
and thematic theme exposures.

The long term vision of Linear is to provide a platform for any user to gain exposure to a wide range of
assets without slippage and settlement time. Furthermore, Linear Finance will act as a reliable gateway with
the adoption of cryptocurrency we saw in 2020 and the collaboration of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and
Centralized Finance (CeFi). Applications can be developed on top of Linear for CeFi / DeFi composability.

LINA token - Collateral and Governance
LINA as the Base Collateral with other Digital Asset Options

LINA tokens are the base collateral to create Liquids using Buildr, which is a decentralized application for
collateral pool and Liquids management. The creation of Liquids will require a pledge ratio which is over
100%, i.e. over-pledged. Over-pledging is necessary to ensure the volatility of the pledged assets do not
adversely affect the stability of the entire system. In the long run, the pledge ratio can gradually be optimized
and this will be determined by the community-driven LinearDAO.

Compared to other competitors which are testing to accept cryptocurrency such as Ether (ETH) as collateral,
Linear protocol will take a hybrid approach instead. As such, Buildr will accept a mixture of LINA tokens
and other digital assets as collateral. There will be a threshold on the size of non-LINA tokens to be accepted
in order to stabilize the LINA token economy. The threshold is subject to community adjustment with the
inception of the LinearDAO.

LINA Staking Rewards

Incentives are provided to LINA stakers in the following ways:

Pro-rata Exchange Fee

Transaction fees are generated whenever a user exchanges one type of Liquid to another using our
Linear.Exchange platform. The initial transaction fee is set to be 0.25%. Stakers will obtain such rewards
(in (USD) weekly on a pro-rata basis given that their Pledge Ratio (P ratio) is above the threshold.

The non LINA-type collateral part of the staking (if any) is only partially entitled to such reward.
Inflationary Reward

Linear adopts an inflationary tokenomics with a decreasing rate until a terminal floor is reached. We share
the same vision as Ethereum in the sense that the imminent inflation reward is important for the explosive
growth of the platform while the long term terminal rate should help stabilizing the total LINA supply in
circulation. Currently the starting inflation is set as 60% (of the tokens designated for staking) and the
inflation going forward depends on the circulating supply and the expected growth of the exchange volume.

There will be a yearly review in the format of LinearDAO.

Stakers will obtain such reward weekly on a pro-rata basis given that their P ratio is above the threshold.
The non LINA-type collateral part of the staking (if any) is only partially entitled to such reward.

Yield Farming Campaign
12th January 2021

Given the current DeFi environment and yield farming trend, we realize the importance of appealing to
yield farmers upon the launch of the project in order to help bootstrap the debt pool and have users
experience the usability and ease of our protocol. As such, we view this as a cost of user acquisition and
upon the launch of Linear, in addition to the proposed token distributions, which will be front loaded in the
first two years, users who fully utilize the exchange will have token bonuses, allowing them to yield a larger
portion of the reward pool. Whilst our LINA token and CUSD are ERC-20 tokens, Liquids are EVM
compatible and hence, they can all be deposited by users in third party pools such as Balancer, Uniswap,
and Curve to facilitate yield stacking.

In addition, we will also be leveraging the use of token rewards to also incentivize users to help stabilize
the debt pool in certain instances. When the debt pool becomes unbalanced in exposures e.g. if a large
number of users create Liquids against gold (Long), we will provide users who counterbalance this trade
by creating a Liquid short against gold with additional token rewards, ultimately reducing the volatility and
increasing the safety of the debt pool.

Pledge Ratio

The starting ratio is initially set at an optimal rate of 500% and will be subject for further review by the
LinearDAO. The initially high P ratio is essential for the long term growth of the platform amid black swan
or volatile incidents. The P ratio varies with the price variation of LINA token. If the P ratio of a staker
rises, the user can choose to build more Liquids as long as the P ratio is not below the threshold. On the
other hand, if the P ratio of a staker drops below the threshold, the user is required to stake more LINA or
burn part of the Liquids until the ratio is at least on par with the threshold in order for him to claim pro-rata
platform transaction fees.

The Linear Pool

The existence of the Linear Pool is the key to the overall platform as it acts as “an decentralized
counterparty” to all Liquids exchanges, thus generating unlimited liquidity for platform users. For LINA
stakers, they incur a debt whenever using Buildr to create a Liquid. The debt value varies with respect to
all the Liquids in the system. For example, if all the Liquids on the platform are synthetic gold ({XAU), the
price fluctuation of gold is insignificant as gold price increases the corresponding debt value of each (XAU
holder increases the same amount, or vice versa.

Users, i.e. the LINA stakers hence act as liquidity providers while using the platform at the same time.

Depending on the Liquids created, the overall debt level changes according to the overall long / short ratio.
Below are the 2 major journeys that normal users and market-makers have:

Normal Users

1. Get LINA tokens via our fiat payment gateway partners, CEXs or DEXs
2. Stake LINA tokens via Linear.Buildr to build (USD
12th January 2021

3. Get Liquids exposure using (USD and exchange among different Liquids via Linear.Exchange
4. Claim the transaction split and staking rewards
5. Convert the Liquids exposure back to (USD
6. Burn the CUSD to unlock the staked LINA tokens
Market Maker

1. Get LINA tokens via our fiat payment gateway partners, CEXs or DEXs

2. Stake LINA tokens via Linear.Buildr to build (USD

3. Depending on the net position of a particular Liquid, for example, if the position of (XAU is net
long 50%, marketmaker can help stabilize the debt pool by doing the other side (i.e. go short on
XAU in this case)

4. Linear will incentivize the marketmaker to do so by providing extra yield (i.e. LINA tokens) on top
of the inflation/staking reward and transaction fee split for their effort to stabilize the debt pool

Linear.Exchange
The Issue

Liquids provide a seamless exposure for all users. Imagine a world without Linear.Exchange, when Alice
wants to switch her exposure from CAC 40 index to Bitcoin, it would take her approximately two days to
get the proceeds from her brokerage account because of T+2 settlement timeframe and another 1 to 2 days
for the broker to direct a transaction to Alice’s bank account. Afterwards, it would be another couple of
days for Alice to wire money from her bank account to a cryptocurrency exchange before she can finally
switch her exposure into Bitcoin, ultimately exposing her to a potential negative price movement.

The Solution

Linear.Exchange can seamlessly solve the issue with the debt pool concept and unlimited liquidity. Any
Liquids settlement timeframe can be lowered into seconds with the help of blockchain technology (as
compared to T+2 in traditional securities). Linear is now working with selected public blockchains with
EVM compatibility to further lower the settlement timeframe with block times as low as few seconds and
instant finality. In this case we can combine the best of the both worlds: the most sought-after tooling and
infrastructure of Ethereum and the high TPS of other public blockchains. In addition, when creating
Liquids, as it will be on the other blockchains, the transaction fees will be minimal, compared to the high
gas fees of Ethereum. The front-running problem of some existing platforms can also be very much
alleviated as the oracle will be able to refresh prices in a much higher frequency at much lower fees.

For All Investment Exposure

One of the goals of the Linear.Exchange is to not only reduce the hassle and risk involved in cross-assets
investment but to also expand the breadth of investable assets. Upon our launch, Linear.Exchange will
support not only cryptocurrency but also traditional assets such as commodities, forex, market indices,
thematic exposures, and ultimately equities. In addition, we will start an internal group that focuses on
building thematic exposures within the crypto world and traditional equities depending upon the wishes
and asks from our users and approved by the governance base. What’s more, Linear will be building our
exchange functionalities that will allow users to effectively manage their exposure and additional asset
management functionalities such as portfolio management and analytics.

System Architecture

In order to effectively solve the high transaction fee and oracle frontrunning problem of existing DeFis on
Ethereum, Linear is adopting a cross-chain approach by supporting both the Ethereum and EVM-
compatible blockchains. From a user’s perspective, he would only need to initialize both an Ethereum-
based wallet and the EVM-compatible wallet. Operation-wise it would be exactly the same as handling the
wallets separately, while Linear will help pegging the two wallets and record the pegging on smart contracts.
By separating the smart contract suite of Linear into 2 different blockchains, the following benefits can be
achieved:

1. As LinearDAO and Linear tokens (ERC-20) are deployed on Ethereum, we are able to maximize
the support from the DeFi community (which is the largest on Ethereum so far) and cross-DeFi
partnership with other protocols.

2. For Buildr and Exchange the smart contract logic will be deployed on the EVM-compatible
blockchains. The entire Liquids building and trading will be nearly free from gas fee, which greatly
improves the user experience.

3. Since the block time of our partnering EVM-compatible blockchains are much lower than that of
Ethereum and the transaction fee is almost minimized as compared to the Ethereum side, Linear
enables users to build Liquids with a more prompt oracle price update, making the window for
front-running much lower. As such, stakers' tokens can be better protected and there will also be
less concern on the debt inflation.

4. The entire process will be optimized and automated in the near future to reduce any potential
friction when cross-chain smart contracts are called.

Building

All assets are supported by the decentralized debt pool of LINA tokens and other major/stable
cryptocurrencies. Hence holders of LINA (and/or other major/stable cryptos) can use their balances to build
Liquids using Buildr.

In order to reduce the gas fee required and improve the time required for building Liquids, Linear makes
use of the best of both Ethereum and partner chain networks. This means that there will be a cross-chain
operation when LINA tokens are pledged to build Liquids, utilizing smart contracts on both chains so that
from a user perspective they will not notice the difference. The only extra requirement is for users to have
a partner chain-based wallet which will be pegged to their Ethereum wallet so that when LINA tokens /
other cryptos are swapped to the partner chain, the Liquids will be built on the partner chain.

Once the Liquids are built, an user can perform seamless transactions and adjust his exposure freely with
much lower fees and faster confirmation time due to the high performance of the EVM-compatible
blockchains. Users can also perform cross-chain actions to convert Liquids back to Ethereum for cross-
chain composability and use.

For the optimal P ratio as initialized above, it can be adjusted upward or downward via community

governance. The ratio of LINA: other acceptable collaterals can also be included shall the community
12th January 2021

provide a sensible proposal. On the other hand, stakers will create debt when building Liquids. In order to
remove the exposure (i.e. to unlock the staked LINA tokens / other acceptable collaterals), Liquids have to
be burned. If the prices of LINA increases, a user can choose to keep a higher P ratio as a price shock buffer

OR build more (USD and maintain the minimal P ratio.

Exchange

For the best user experience, the Liquids exchange smart contract suites will be on the EVM-compatible
partner blockchain. To trade on Linear.Exchange, the counterparty is different from that of traditional
Centralized Exchanges (CEX) or any order book based Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) where a user trades
against another user. Instead, users are trading directly with Linear’s smart contracts backed by a debt pool
with the price provided by oracle providers to supply price feed of underlying assets.

Linear will support Liquids pairing with respect to (USD and other large cap coins such as (BTC and CETH
in the future. Depending on the base pair, it will be first burned into (USD form and a transaction fee of
0.25% will be deducted from the proceeds before the conversion. The total supply of the newly built Liquids
will then be updated.

Fee Claim
The fee claim procedures will be as follows:

Depending on the amount of LINA users stake (any other digital assets staked will only be entitled to partial
rewards), their rewards (a. Inflationary reward and b. transaction fee split) will be stored in the
corresponding reward claim smart contracts.

Users will be able to claim their unlocked weekly distribution every Wednesday. For inflationary reward,
there is a lock-up of 1 year for ensuring the healthiness and long term growth of the platform. The locked
up amount of inflationary reward will be automatically staked in the debt pool. This amount will also help
to lower the overall P ratio of that user.
12th January 2021

Burning

Stakers can reduce their debt and unlock the LINA tokens / others by burning the Liquids they built. The
initial debt level and the current debt level of a particular user may vary, depending on the long / short ratio
of the overall pool. Ideally speaking it should be 50:50 and Linear is incentivizing marketmakers to maintain
this ratio by providing extra yields.

Since the decomposition of Liquids (i.e. burning of debts) will be performed on the partner blockchain, the
entire process can be done nearly instantaneously and nearly 0 fees.

Debt Pool

As the debt pool serves as the counterparty of users on the platform, there should be proper tracking on the
segregate level of each user’s debt amount (and the changes over time due to platform use of building and
decomposing by himself or others).

This means that the current debt amount may be different from the initial debt amount of users. User’s debt
proportion with respect to the entire debt pool is based on the building / decomposition history and the
corresponding Liquids size, and overall debt pool level. This is a changing number determined by the entire
Liquids portfolio of the platform as users are indeed betting against the decentralized debt pool.

Oracle

Oracle is the backbone of feeding our platform prices of different Liquids. Supported by the Dev team of
our first EVM-compatible partner blockchain, we will be using oracles that can update prices in a nearly-
instantaneous manner. Linear is also exploring some of the decentralized cross-chain oracle partners in long
term.

For inverse Liquids, Linear will be utilizing some existing short tokens, which is essentially a derivatives
portfolio with 1x short exposure and regular re-balancing. Going forward, we can also implement short
tokens with higher leverage e.g. 3x to balance the debt pool.

Solutions for Existing Issues
The following session concludes different issues that our current DeFi competitors still have:
Improved Collateralization Mechanism

There is no proper mechanism to deal with the high pledge ratio of synthetic asset landscape right now.
Linear is solving the problem right at the beginning by accepting major stable cryptocurrency as collateral.
The community can further decide the LINA:others ratio after the governance protocol is completed. In the

long run Linear will look to tokenize real world assets as collaterals.
Instant and Dynamic Mechanism with Partner Chains

Secondly, the oracle front-running problem has long been an issue with Ethereum based dApps. To really
enable financial innovation and permissionless finance, Linear is tackling the problem by cross-chain
capabilities between Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains. On the partnering EMV-compatible
blockchain side, thanks to the low block time and much lower cost, exchanging Liquids on the platform is
a seamless experience. On the other hand, for oracles on the Ethereum blockchain, a higher frequency of
update will be used. Linear adopts a dynamic mechanism to shorten the update interval based on front-end
interaction on the assets. When the gas fee is low or in the future when scalability is achieved, the oracle

update gas fee can be directly embedded into the transaction performed by users.

Liquidation Mechanism and Insurance Fund

Last but not least, it is vital for Linear to implement a liquidation mechanism in order to handle black swan
events such as the March 12, 2020. Linear will propose a proper liquidation mechanism and open it up for
community governance to decide in order to safeguard the healthiness and resistance to any market
situation. In addition, the setup of an insurance fund will also help tackle any liquidation loss so that the
loss would not need to be socialized everytime. Again, the community can decide on the source of the
insurance fund, e.g. a percentage from the transaction fee.
12th January 2021

Long Term Technology Roadmap

Cross-chain compatibility with non-EVM-compatible blockchains

Though Linear is now working with EVM-compatible blockchains to solve the clogging issues of Ethereum
on day one, the team has already been in touch with some other prominent public blockchains with
innovative and dynamic design that could potentially gain community traction over time. In the long run,
Linear seeks to become the cross-chain compatible delta-one protocol that provides seamless trading
experience across any major blockchains.

Optimization of Transaction Fee and Speed

Currently, we tackle the issue by separating the smart contract logic of Buildr and Exchange on the EVM-
compatible blockchains which have high TPS and much lower fees. However, the gas fee on the Ethereum
side could still be a long term problem shall the usage of the blockchain keep going up with ETH 2.0 still
a long way to go.

In order to solve the issue, Linear plans to implement Layer 2 solution in the later versions. For example,
by using zk-rollup on Ethereum, the TPS, fees and oracle problems can be better handled. The team is
currently looking into the best way for utilizing zk-rollup without adding friction on the front-end side.

Liquidation mechanism

As mentioned above, despite the fact that users are required with a dynamic pledge ratio of around 500%,
there should also be a liquidation mechanism that should be triggered when the P ratio is under a certain
number, say 150%. There will be a punitive conversion rate for Linear to re-purchase the corresponding
Liquids using the pledged LINA tokens to ensure the stability of the debt pool. If the value from the
liquidation of the Liquids is higher than the value of the LINA tokens at liquidation, a system loss will be
incurred. On the other hand, when the value from the liquidation of the Liquids is lower than that of LINA

tokens, there will be a system profit.
LinearDAO (explained in the paragraph later) will decide on this implementation and handle the profit and

loss when it comes to liquidation. It could be in the form of an insurance fund or distributed socially across

the platform.

LinearDAO

After the launch of the protocol, Linear will be under the governance of LinearDAO on important
parameters and platform design such as:

wR YN >

Pledge ratio

LINA inflation reward and frequency

Split of transaction fees on areas such as burn, fee claims and Linear Reserve

New functionalities and technology roadmap

Proposals can be submitted by the community and voting will be done to determine whether they
should be adopted or not. In between there will be discussion on each proposal before the voting
so as to ensure the voting is meaningful to the long term growth of the platform.

12th January 2021

Summary

The team at Linear, with a strong technical background and financial investment experience is committed
to bringing our protocol to market and expanding financial inclusivity to all users. While investing may be
difficult, we want it to be easy, cheap, and transparent so that you don’t have to be a rocket scientist to build
and manage your investments on our exchange. Whilst the above will be our short term goal, in the long
term we recognize the value of building Linear as an asset layer and will welcome app developers to build
additional asset management dApps on top of Linear. Lastly, in the spirit of decentralized finance, upon
launch, we will start the planning and transition of our governance to a DAO, allowing our user community
to help and continue to drive innovation and be key decision makers within our protocol and ultimately
becoming a protocol for users, built by users.

2. Introduction

The blockchain is an undeniably ingenious invention —- the
brainchild of a person or group of people known by the
pseudonym, Satoshi Nakamoto. But since then, it has evolved into
something greater, and the main question every single person is
asking is: What is Blockchain?

Is Blockchain Technology the New Internet?

By allowing digital information to be distributed but not copied,
blockchain technology created the backbone of a new type of
internet. Originally devised for the digital currency, Bitcoin
blockchain, (Buy Bitcoin) the tech community has now found
other potential uses for the technology.

A blockchain is, in the simplest of terms, a time-stamped series of
immutable records of data that is managed by a cluster of
computers not owned by any single entity. Each of these blocks of
data (i.e. block) is secured and bound to each other using
cryptographic principles (ie. chain).

So, what is so special about it and why are we saying that it has
industry-disrupting capabilities?

The blockchain network has no central authority — it is the very
definition of a democratized system. Since it is a shared and
immutable ledger, the information in it is open for anyone and
veryone to see. Hence, anything that is built on the blockchain is
by its very nature transparent and everyone involved is
accountable for their actions.
A blockchain carries no transaction cost.(An infrastructure cost
yes, but no transaction cost.)

2 ZEEDEX Whitepaper | 5

The blockchain is a simple yet ingenious way of passing
information from A to B ina fully automated and safe manner.
One party to a transaction initiates the process by creating a block.
This block is verified by thousands, perhaps millions of computers
distributed around the net. The verified block is added to a chain,
which is stored across the net, creating not just a unique record,
but a unique record with a unique history. Falsifying a single
record would mean falsifying the entire chain in millions of

instances. That is virtually impossible. Bitcoin uses this model for
monetary transactions, but it can be deployed in many other
ways.

The reason why the blockchain has gained so much admi
that:

@ It is not owned by a single entity, hence it is decentralized.
@ The data is cryptographically stored inside.

The blockchain is immutable, so no one can tamper with
the data that is inside the blockchain.

The blockchain is transparent so one can track the data if
they want to.
Proof of Stake

Proof of Stake (PoS) concept states that a person can mine or
validate block transactions according to how many coins he or
she holds. This means that the more Bitcoin or altcoin owned by a
miner, the more mining power he or she has.

Understanding Proof of Stake (PoS)

The proof of stake was created as an alternative to the proof of
work (PoW), to tackle inherent issues in the latter. When a
transaction is initiated, the transaction data is fitted into a block
with a maximum capacity of 1 megabyte, and then duplicated
across multiple computers or nodes on the network. The nodes
are the administrative body of the blockchain and verify the
egitimacy of the transactions in each block. To carry out the
verification step, the nodes or miners would need to solve a
computational puzzle, known as the proof of work problem. The
first miner to decrypt each block transaction problem gets
rewarded with coin. Once a block of transactions has been
verified, it is added to the blockchain, a public transparent ledger.
ining requires a great deal of computing power to run different

cryptographic calculations to unlock the computational challeng-
es. The computing power translates into a high amount of
electricity and power needed for the proof of work. In 2015, it was
estimated that one Bitcoin transaction required the amount of
lectricity needed to power up 1.57 American households per day.
To foot the electricity bill, miners would usually sell their awarded
coins for fiat money, which would lead to a downward movement

To foot the electricity bill, miners would usually sell their awarded
coins for fiat money, which would lead to a downward movement
in the price of the cryptocurrency.

The proof of stake (PoS) seeks to address this issue by attributing
mining power to the proportion of coins held by a miner. This way,
instead of utilizing energy to answer PoW puzzles, a PoS miner is
limited to mining a percentage of transactions that is reflective of
his or her ownership stake. For instance, a miner who owns 3% of
the Bitcoin available can theoretically mine only 3% of the blocks.

3.Decentralized Exchanges

Asa relatively new development in the world of cryptocurrency,
decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges solve many of the more
pressing issues faced by centralized exchanges, such as trust,
security, high trading fees, and the need for personal
documentation. The cryptocurrency landscape is evolving and
gaining strength, but is lagging as far as regulations are
concerned. But what are decentralized exchanges, and how are
they likely to affect the cryptocurrency market?

Decentralized exchanges and how they differ from centralized
crypto exchanges

@® Centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CCEs) have, until
now, been the primary platforms for trading
cryptocurrencies. CCEs work in a similar way to stock
markets, where a CCE will be owned and operated by a
single organisation that has full control over all
transactions.

e CCEs make use of middlemen or intermediaries, much as
we use and trust a bank to manage our financial assets.
These middlemen act like stock brokers and they conduct
transactions and trades for users.

@ CCEs are where order reviewing, matching between users,
routing, and execution of order transactions through
exchange software and servers, take place.
2 ZE=EDEX Whitepaper | 9

co CCE users do not have access to the private keys of their
exchange wallet’s account (the software programmes used
to handle key management) but rather access it through a
process called custody, which refers to who holds the keys
to accounts on the exchange.

OF Currently, 99% of trading volume take place on centralized
exchanges, with 73% being custodial.For example, when
you buy cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin, it will appear in your
account. However, you don't own it and cannot manage it
yet as it’s in ‘custody’. To gain control, you need to re
transfer of that cryptocurrency to your external wa
address from your exchange provider or middlema
means that transactions can only be processed thro
the verified operators within the exchange, and approved
by a central authority.

2 ZEEDEX Whitepaper | 10

Decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges (DEXs), much like
cryptocurrencies, are not owned or operated by a single

company.

ee DExXs don't keep custody of customers’ funds, positions, or
information, but serve only as a matching and routing layer
for trade orders. There is no need for an exchange or
intermediary institution to manage the ledger or control

user funds.

ee Rather, DEXs allow trades to take place directly between
users in a peer-to-peer manner, with the help of an
automated process.

© They allow non-custodial exchanges, which means that
users can keep all the funds in their wallets and
independently request and allow trades from their wallet.

The DEX in this instance is the matching service.

The main benefit of DEXs is that you're not dependent on the
protocols of the exchange or third party, because you hold the
funds in your personal wallet.lt’s also more private, as users don't
have to surrender their personal details to an organisation and
can trade anonymously if they prefer. Additionally, DEXs are at no
risk of server downtime, as hosting is distributed throughout the
nodes, or people, involved in the exchange. And are less
vulnerable to being hacked than CCEs.

4.The Impact On The
Cryptocurrency Market

Cryptocurrencies have revolutionised traditional finance through
the new opportunities for value trading — without the need for
formal banking institutes. As of May 2019, data site Cryptocoin
Charts indexed 5,442 crypto currencies, with $171.41 billion market
capitalisation. According to a recent study by Cambridge
University, the current number of total crypto user accounts is
now over 139 million, with an estimated minimum of 1,876 people
employed full-time in cryptocurrency companies — most of whom
are in the exchanges sector.

Due to blockchain technology, the need for a central institution is
removed, as the transparent ledger platform allows individuals to
trade with trust. However, to enter the cryptocurrency ecosystem,
cryptocurrency first needs to be purchased using fiat currency,
such as dollars, or euros. This is ironically done through a
centralized institution, such as Coinbase or Kraken, two of the
major cryptocurrency exchanges, who require personal
information and manage your accounts.In other words, the only

way to enter a non-custodian, decentralized ecosystem, is to pass
through a centralized institution. Despite this, the benefits

provided by DEXs of offering users alternative ways to find one
another, and trade directly on-chain, are making them
increasingly popular.

5.Project Overview

Zeedex is a decentralized exchange where users can trade
cryptocurrencies. It will be a Defi Hub in the Industry providing on
chain staking. We will be supporting mulltiple crypto projects to
team up with us and launch staking. Basically any ERC-20 token
can be turned to DeFi using our protocol.

Coin Staking gives currency holders some voting power too in

addition to income from earning interest based on holdings and
discounts.

Whitepaper | 13

Any erc20 token project can be turned into DeFi using our
technology.

Defi”, is the use of blockchain technologies (including smart
contracts, decentralized asset custody, etc.) to replace all
“intermediaries” with program codes, therefore maximizing the
efficiency of financial services and minimizing costs.

The best part about Zeedex is that apart from match making,
everything happens on-chain, so there is no deposit or withdrawal
of funds.

We also have our token incorporated with utilities like Fees
deduction, IEOs and Staking.

Executive Summary

Recently, distributed ledger technologies - decentralized and trustless blockchains (e.g.
Bitcoin, Ethereum), have started rewiring the nature of our current economy,
communications, and knowledge. As the global financial transaction volume in all
electronic payments grows, the low capacity of the current blockchain-based networks
cannot cover the world’ s commerce anytime. However, a simple pursuit of scalability
usually sacrifices decentralization and security. Therefore, the ultimate goal of
blockchain is to extend the scalability as high as possible while keeping security and
decentralization in an appropriate level.

QuarkChain is an innovative permissionless blockchain architecture that aims to meet
the global-wise commercial standard. It provides a secure, decentralized, and scalable
blockchain solution to deliver 100,000+ on-chain TPS. The main features of QuarkChain
are:

Reshardable two-layered blockchain: QuarkChain consists of two layers of
blockchains. We apply elastic sharding blockchains (shards) as the first layer, anda
root blockchain as the second layer that confirms the blocks from the first layer. The
first layer is flexible to be resharded as needed without changing the root layer.

Guaranteed security by market-driven collaborative mining: To ensure the security of
all transactions, a game-theoretic framework is designed for incentives, where at
least 50% of overall hash powers are allocated to the root chain to prevent double
spending attack on any transactions.

a Anti-centralized horizontal scalability: In any blockchain network with a high TPS, a
super-full node can be extremely expensive, which encourages centralization. In
contrast, QuarkChain allows multiple cheap nodes forming a cluster to replace a
super-full node.

Efficient cross-shard transactions: Cross-shard transactions in QuarkChain can be
issued at any time, and confirmed in minutes. The speed of cross-shard transactions
increases linearly as the number of shards increases.

6 Simple account management: There is only one account needed for the entire
blockchains (shards) in QuarkChain. All cryptocurrencies from different shards are
stored in one smart wallet.

Turing-complete smart contract platform: the QuarkChain network supports Turing-
complete smart contracts and has adopted the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to
allow for easy migration of existing EVM decentralized Apps onto the QuarkChain
platform.

1.1 Overview of Blockchain

Back to 1990's, Kevin Kelly already alerted the world to the advent of widespread
encryption -- “crypto-anarchy: encryption always wins.” “Various criminal and
foreign elements will be active users of CryptoNet. But this will not halt the spread
of crypto anarchy.” said by Tim May, a retired Intel physicist (cited from “Out of
Control” ). Just as May and Kelly predicted, since the word “blockchain” was
coined in the original source code of Bitcoin in 2008, the crypto-era has broken out.

Va QuarkChain

In the past several years, many companies have been looking into blockchain
technology. Almost every major financial institution in the world is doing
blockchain research at the moment. Fig. 1 shows that since late 2017, there is a
huge jump of the number of transaction requests in Ethereum system. The
transaction volume demanded is projected to keep increasing since more and
more applications are/will be developing in the near future.

1.2 The Generations of Blockchain Technology

First generation of blockchain is represented by bitcoin, which has started the digital
currency technology revolution in the financial world. The second generation of
blockchain technology is led by Ethereum. Ethereum developed “smart contract”
which made blockchain allow not only the cash-like tokens but also financial
instruments, like loans or bonds. The Ethereum smart contract platform now has a
market cap of around 65 billion dollars (source: https://coinmarketcap.com/).

One important breakthrough of blockchain is called “proof of stake (POS)” . Current
generation blockchains are mostly secured by “proof of work (POW),” which requires
significant amount of hash power (and thus electrical power) these days and is not so
energy efficient. In contrast, the POS systems assign the block rewards to the holder of
tokens proportionally, which significantly reduce the amount of energy to mine a block
and is much more economically efficient.

Blockchain visionaries imagined that this technology would spark innovation in every
industry and set off a massive restructuring of communications and transactions, but
this is not possible in its current state. As the demands increase, as shown in Fig. 1,
another issue facing blockchain is scalability. Currently, major blockchains cannot
even securely handle the volume of financial transactions that occur on centralized
payment systems like Visa which claims to have 56,000 TPS on its network. Bitcoin’ s
and Ethereums 10-20 TPS are many orders of magnitude away from this and even
further from the TPS that loT micropayments would require. The blockchain systems
which do have this capacity have often sacrificed security and decentralization which
are the key features that blockchain technology has to offer. For the speculation
around blockchain to turn into real, widespread adoption, a network that can handle a
large volume of transactions without compromising on security and decentralization
must be developed.

1.3 QuarkChain Vision

The QuarkChain Network introduces a novel sharding-based blockchain architecture
that aims to meet the global commercial standard. The technology behind the
QuarkChain Network was inspired by the team’ s extensive experience in developing
large-scale distributed systems in the centralized world that can handle billions of
transactions per second. The mechanisms from these experiences have been applied
to blockchain to create a unique solution to its scalability problem. This approach aims
to greatly expand the usability of blockchain technology without sacrificing its core
features of security and decentralization.

The QuarkChain Network is helping move blockchain into the next generation by
increasing the current TPS capacity several-thousand fold of what it is now, toa
projected about 100,000 TPS. The network being built is project to be free of
congestion, making it affordable for all usage scenarios that demand speed and
volume. We envision such a network applied to industries that demand higher TPS.
Ultimately, the QuarkChain Network aims to build a high-throughput network to
support applications such asdistributed social media, high frequency trading, Internet
of Things (loT), gaming, and payment.

2. The Challenges of Blockchain

The three main challenges of a blockchain: security, decentralization, and scalability.

2.1 Security Issue

As a transactional platform, the first priority is always security. A blockchain, as the
name implies, is a chain of digitally connected “blocks” . Blockchain was generated
to provide means of security by doinga “decentralized ledger” .Even though
blockchain has some inherent properties for security, there still exist vulnerabilities,
illintentions, and malicious attacks that need to be considered when one selects the
platform.

In fact, blockchains are decentralized across peer-to-peer (p2p) networks that need
to be continually updated and kept in sync with a specific consensus algorithm (e.g.
POW or POS). A POW-based blockchain would require at least 51% hash power of
the network to perform double-spend attack that could revert any transaction. Such
an attack highly depends on how decentralization the network is, i.e., the more the
blockchain is decentralized, the harder it is for the attack to be performed. If the
blockchain is sufficiently decentralized, reaching more than 51% hash power will be
extremely costly for a single entity (a miner or an owner of a mining pool).

2.2 Decentralization Issue

Since 2013, many decentralized trading platforms have been developed. Different
from the centralized case, decentralized storage and trading allow for drastic
reductions in pricing, so that any company or even person, not just the big ones, can
leverage the technology. As aforementioned, decentralization also gives blockchain
security. However, decentralization is also being challenged these days. For example,
alot of mining pools are formed for POW-based blockchain so that a weak miner is
able to collect its proportional share of block reward in a timely manner instead of
waiting for along period to collect a block reward. The mining pool encourages
centralization and becomes a risk for decentralized POW blockchains. For example, as
of 2013 the top six mining pools consist of 75% of overall Bitcoin hash power.
|XX] QuarkChain

2.3 Scalability Issue
In the following subsections, the existing approaches for scalability issue are reviewed.

2.3.1 Multiple Blockchains

One approach to scaling is splitting up different transactions across multiple
blockchains (e.g. Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, etc.). But while this makes for lower
transactional demand on each blockchain, it also means a lower hash power operating
each blockchain. On smaller chains, it is easy for someone to gain enough of the hash
power to perform a double-spend attack. While it offers some degree of scalability, it
sacrifices security for scalability and is not along-term solution. Having multiple
blockchains also limits cross-chain transactions to cryptocurrency exchanges which
charge trading fees, have long processing times, and are notoriously unsecure.
Additionally, users need to maintain an address in each of the networks which
introduces private key management issues and further security concerns.

2.3.2 Lightning Network

Another approach to alleviate the blockchain scalability problem is by Lightning
Network. The basic idea is to defer frequent transactions among a fixed group of
parties until all parties are finalized with the transactions. Then one of the parties
would just post the final result without incurring multiple historical transactions on
chain. A lightning network generally requires two transactions to create/destroy a
payment channel, which accepts off-chain transactions. The number of off-chain TPS
could be infinite in theory. However, the Lightning Network is only suitable for
frequent transactions among a fixed group of parties, while it is inefficient ifa user’ s
transaction target is random and happens sporadically. Transparency is another
concern because transactions are tracked through lightning channels rather than the
main blockchain. Some off-chain solutions rely on trusted third parties, such as Paypal
or Alipay with blockchain features. This prompts the question of whether it is
necessary to build another centralized payment method when there are already many
out there.
XX QuarkChain

2.3.3 Sharding

Originally, sharding technique from database means partitioning dataina large
database into smaller parts. It is one of the most common ways in centralized systems
to address the scalability problem. For instance, BigTable and Cassandra are two
examples in the non-blockchain world to be born to solve large throughput issues.
Notably, Ethereum has adopted sharding technology to scale out, and its phase one
development is near completion. However, to adopt sharding on an existing
blockchain is complicated, and it is estimated to have 3 to 5 more years to go before
Ethereum can fully support other fundamental sharding features, such as cross-shard
transactions. The main challenges for sharding include cross-shard transactions,
security issues like single shard take-over, and further scalability issues. There are
also different proposals such as OmniLedger which claims to reach about 100,000 TPS
by introducing intricate consensus protocols. In some other cases, a user account is
partitioned by introducing sharding; as a result, users may end up having multiple
accounts in order to make transactions with others.

2.4 Tradeoffs

Although security, decentralization, and scalability are all important for a blockchain,
there are some tradeoffs among them. As shown in Fig. 2, if one wants to increase the
security/privacy, a larger amount of data are needed for each transaction. This means
lower transaction speed and larger storage.

3. The Technology of The QuarkChain Network
3.1 Design Principle

QuarkChain's design is based on the following principles:

®@ Enhancing the scalability while ensuring security and decentralization

@ Enabling seamless cross-shard transaction for user quality of experience (QoE)
®B Simple account management for clients

@ Open standard to support various Dapp

®@ Incentive-driven ecosystem

Some blockchain designs trade off security with scalability. For example, OmniLedger
claims to reach about 100,000 TPS by only handling 1% adversarial power (Source: Fig.
6in “OmniLedger: A Secure, Scale-Out, Decentralized Ledger via Sharding” from
https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/406.pdf).

Since the demands have increased tremendously, the ultimate goal of blockchain is to
extend the scalability as high as possible while keeping security and decentralization
in an appropriate level.

set of all transactions, while the root
blockchain confirms the blocks in all
shards by including the block headers
in the root blocks.

Layer

X QuarkChain

For current blockchain technology, there are two basic functionalities in each block
within the chains:

@ Ledger, which includes current ledger state, performs transactions, and records
results. To be data-intensive is the key property of a ledger — both current ledger
and transactions details including source, destination, amount, execution code,
etc, need to be maintained. The limited size of data that can be packed into a
block is one of the bottleneck of current blockchains.

@ Confirmation, which confirms the result of the transactions from ledger and then
mines the block to reach desired difficulty (POW). This ensures an attacker is
economically inefficient to revert a transaction by mining another fork.
Confirmation itself is a computational-intensive task.

Based on the observation, the QuarkChain Network adopts the divide-and-conquer
idea to separate the two main functions in two layers and thus enhance the
scalability while guaranteeing the security. The detailed design is given as follows.

@ The QuarkChain Network contains an elastic sharding blockchain layer, which
contains a list of minor blockchains (shards). Each shard processes a sub-set of all
transactions independently. Therefore, as the number of shards increases, shards
can process more transactions concurrently. As a result, the system capacity
increases as the number of shards increases.

@ The QuarkChain Network has a root blockchain (rootchain) that confirms all
blocks from sharded blockchains. The root blockchain does not process any
transactions (since it is not economically efficient), but its block has sufficiently
strong difficulty so that reverting any transaction, i.e., the transactions in root
blockchain, is not economically efficient.

@ The QuarkChain Networkis also designed to support additional shards in an
active network. Adding more shards is easy and fast, while users barely sense this
(the users may feel faster processing of transactions if the network is congested
before adding shards).

Table 1 Structure of the QuarkChain Network

a4 QuarkChain

3.3 Collaborative Mining

The goal of collaborative mining is to design incentive mechanisms and difficulty algorithms
so that

@ Hash powers are incentivized to distribute evenly among shards. This ensures that all
shards are mined evenly and thus the system throughput (i.e., TPS) increases as the
number of shards increases.

@ The root chain has a significant large portion (over 50%) of hash power over the whole
hash power of the network. This prevents double-spend attack, and a malicious miner
needs at least 50% * 50% = 25% power to perform an attack.

Note that a network using the system of the QuarkChain Network has several minor
blockchains (shards) and one root blockchain. Each blockchain offers different incentives
and difficulties. Miners could choose any blockchain at an optimal price of their hash power.
This creates an open market economic model, where a blockchain is a seller with goods being
the block reward, while a miner is a buyer with hash power being their currency. It is desirable
that a marketing model is designed with features ensuring that though each party in the
market pursues their own interests, the collective behaviors of each party can benefit all.

and difficulty to protect the blocks (and thus transactions) in all shards, while all shards are incentivized to

va QuarkChain

3.4 Consensus Algorithm

To protect all transactions, the root chain and the shards in systems of the QuarkChain Network
run the following consensus algorithm:

@ The root chain runs the POW algorithm, which is the same as Bitcoin and Ethereum. This
means when two forks happen on root chain, the fork with the longest length (or total
difficulty) will survive.

® Each shard runs a consensus called root-chain-first POW algorithm. Given two forks ona
shard, to determine which fork to survive, a node would compare their corresponding root
chains before comparing the forks. Ifa fork has longer root chain, then the fork will survive
no matter how long another fork is. With such consensus algorithm, a double-spend attacker
has to create (see Figure 5):

(a) the minor blocks that revert the transaction; and
(b) alonger root chain fork that includes the minor block headers.

Such attack is much harder to perform because the attacker must acquire at least 50% (hash
power on root chain) * 51% = 25% hash power of overall network .

3.5 Early Verification of the QuarkChain Network

Since the system of the QuarkChain Network is sophisticated and highly dynamic, an
analytic solution could be hardly available. To design such a system to achieve the
targeted goals, the QuarkChain team has resorted to using network simulation to
simulate a 18-node and 8-shard network. This potentially allows verification of the
incentive mechanism and difficulty algorithm in early stage.

simulation, where two miners have 100x hash power than the rest of 16 miners.

va QuarkChain

The system of the QuarkChain Network has 8 minor blockchains with target
block duration 10s and a root blockchain with target block duration 150s. Some
interesting comments are discussed as follows:

®@ The heights of all minor blockchains are about 3800s, and they are very close
to each other. In addition, all of them have similar work (i.e., the expected
hashes to generate a block), and their block intervals are very close to 10s.
This means that all minor blockchains are mined evenly and thus the system
throughput is about 8x more than the single shard case.

@ The work of the root blockchain is about 1.6M, which is close to the expected
value 1.8M (half of the hash power of the network because all minor chains
have 15K work every 10 seconds, and a root blockchain block rate is about 15
times longer than the minor chains).

va QuarkChain

4. The Positioning of the QuarkChain Network in Blockchain Society

The QuarkChain Network reveals a brand new path for blockchain design. This
section discusses its relationship with other existing blockchains and positions it in
the blockchain society.

4.1 Relationship with Single-Blockchain or Multiple-Blockchain Systems

The 50% hash power allocation on the root chain of the QuarkChain Network is
reconfigurable (e.g., 25% or 75%). By adjusting the hash power, the QuarkChain
Network can resemble existing blockchain systems.

®@ If the hash power of the root chain is 100%, then the system of the QuarkChain
Network becomes a single-blockchain system as there is no miner on shards and all
miners will only mine the root chain and weak miners may join mining pool. In
addition, the root chain could include as much minor blocks as possible, and thus a
root block is essentially a unlimited-sized block as single-blockchain system

®@ If the hash power of the root chain is 0%, then the system of the QuarkChain
Network becomes a multiple independent blockchain system. Each shard of the
QuarkChain Network can be treated as an independent blockchain. It is more
scalable of course, and it is also more decentralized since a weak miner may not
need to join a mining pool. However, it is very insecure due to the dilutionof hash
power, e.g., a malicious attacker could easily perform a double-spend attack on
one of the blockchain in a 100-shard system with only 1/200 hash power of overall
network.
IY! QuarkChain

4.2 Security, Decentralization, and Scalability Position of The QuarkChain Network

The 50% hash power allocation on the root chain of the QuarkChain Network
enhances system security besides scalability. In addition, the QuarkChain Network is
more decentralized than single-blockchain system so that the QuarkChain Network is
also secure.

®@ Dramatically scale the throughput of the network. Advanced sharding technologies
have been used to improve the system capacity and could easily increase system
capacity to process more transactions per second as needed.

® More decentralized than single-blockchain network. As the hash power of a single-
blockchain network increases, the expected return time of weak miners grows
significantly, and they have to join a mining pool to collect their incentives ina
timely manner. This greatly encourages centralization and hurts the core value of a
blockchain. The QuarkChain Network is designed to be more decentralized
because a weaker miner does not need to join a mining pool to collect its reward.

@ Security. All transactions in the QuarkChain Network are protected by 50% of the
overall hash power of the network, and a double-spend attack requires at least 25%
hash power. This is smaller than single-blockchain’ s 50%, but since the
QuarkChain Network is more decentralized, a miner will be much harder to collect
51% hash power in our network than that of single-blockchain.

5. The Core Features of the QuarkChain Network

Unlike many existing approaches that attempt to address the scalability problem by
enhancing existing systems, the QuarkChain Network is designed for scalability from
the beginning - similar to its centralized counterpart. The QuarkChain Network is
developed according to the following important values: usability (fast, simple),
decentralization (public participation), safety (reliable). Features of the QuarkChain
Network are listed below.

5.1 Anti-Centralized Horizontal Scalability Expansion

To build a peer-to-peer network that is impervious to malicious attack, traditional
blockchain technologies require every node to fully validate all blocks and reject any
block that is invalid. Similarly, the node in the QuarkChain Network that validates all
minor blocks and root chain blocks is called super-full node. If every node in the
QuarkChain Network runs as super-full node, the QuarkChain Network could have the
same safety level as traditional blockchains.

However, running a super-full node could be very expensive in a high-throughput
blockchain system. For example, 1M TPS with each transaction being 250 bytes would
require 2 GBps network bandwidth, which becomes a huge barrier to many users. In
addition, the traffic would generate about 20 Terabytes data per day or 7 Perabytes
data per year. The high requirements on CPU, storage, memory, and network
bandwidth of super-full node impose a significant barrier, and such requirements may
be only acceptable by powerful parties (e.g., company uses powerful workstation in
their data center). This greatly discourages decentralization and hurts the core values
of blockchain.

Fig. 7(A) illustration of horizontal scalability of the QuarkChain Network, where four super-full nodes (left) are replaced
by four clusters of nodes (right), where the nodes in each cluster are honest to each other. (Solid line indicates honest
connections, and dash line indicates unreliable connections)

Fig. 7(B) illustration of high availability of a cluster with 2 shards run on the QuarkChain Network, where
the cluster could still fully validate the network even any single node is crashed (right). For example,
suppose there are 2 shards in the system, A validates shards 1-2, B validates shards 2 and root chain, and
C validates shards 1 and root blockchain, and A,B,C are honest to each other, thenA,B,C could forma
cluster that is able to fully validate any blocks.

The QuarkChain Network addresses the concern by allowing multiple honest nodes
ina cluster to run as a super-full node. Each node in the cluster only validates a
sub-set of chains. As long as the union of their sub-sets cover root blockchain and
minor blockchains, it can be shown that they are able to fully validate the whole
blockchains without acquiring an expensive machine. In addition, if one of the
nodes crashes in the cluster, the rest nodes are still able to fully validate any blocks
since any two of them form another cluster, enabling high availability of such
clusters.

Furthermore, to encourage forming such clusters in the network, the QuarkChain
Network will have incentives for miners to answer a puzzle about the information of
random blocks (e.g., 64-bit xor on random blocks in a randomly-selected shard or
root blockchain). The puzzle will perform over a large amount of blocks and it is
memory or storage intensive, and thus downloading the random blocks on-
demand from the network will be inefficient.
IY QuarkChain

5.2 Efficient and Secure Cross-Shard Transaction

In the system of the QuarkChain Network, the transactions can be classified into two
categories:

@ In-shard transactions, where the input and output addresses of the transaction are in

the same shard.
@ Cross-shard transactions, where the input and output addresses are in different shards.

In-shard transactions are simple, since a shard already contains complete ledger
information of the shard. Cross-shard transactions are more difficult because of the
synchronization between two shards. The QuarkChain Network fully supports cross-shard
transactions as first-class citizen, in a sense that:

@ Any user could issue any cross-shard transaction at any time

@ Cross-shard transactions can be confirmed in minutes

@ The throughput of cross-shard transactions could be scaled linearly as the number of
shards increases

Shard 1
Shard 2
Shard n

Fig. 8 Illustration of cross-shard transactions, where the output of the transaction can be spent as long as
the cross-shard transaction is confirmed by the root chain.

These key features of the QuarkChain Network have the potential tp create a world in
which anyone will be able to easily perform any transaction in a cost-effective manner.

Fig. 9 Illustration of simple account management, where an account with a private key is able to perform
transaction on any shards.

Unlike other sharding solutions in which a user may need to create multiple accounts
in different shards in order to interact with all users/smart contracts in the network,
the system of the QuarkChain Network greatly simplifies account management - a
user only needs to have one account to manage all addresses in all shards and is able
to interact with all users seamlessly. In addition, asmart wallet application will be
created which will automatically perform cross-shard or in-shard transactions
(including smart contract) for a user, and the user may not be even aware of sharding
inthe system. Some users may choose advanced way to manage their addresses,
e.g., allowing payments always via in-shard transactions, and thus a merchandise is
able to receive a payment from all users in seconds.

5.4 Cross-Chain Transaction

With this design architecture, cross-chain transaction becomes approachable. Since
the QuarkChain Network only maintains one root chain, the transaction from another
blockchain can be implemented by converting the tokens by an adapter and then
performing the transaction like a cross-shard transaction from the point of view of
the QuarkChain Network side. Another way is to accommodate the other chain as a
subchain (or shard) so that cross-chain becomes cross-shard transaction.

6.The System Operational Aspects of The QuarkChain Network

6.1 On-Chain and Off-Chain Transactions

Even as the QuarkChain Network supports high scalability, it can also accommodate
off-chain transactions. Some applications need both on-chain and off-chain handling.
For example, some transactions need to access external data (not on the blockchain).
The two-layer sharding structure of the QuarkChain Network makes this on-chain and
off-chain handling very flexible. This opens more opportunities and applications.

6.2 Smart Contract

The QuarkChain Network will support smart contracts via Ethereum virtual machine
(EVM). EVM is the most widely used execution engine for smart contracts. Most of the
existing dApps built on top of EVM can be directly deployed on the platform of the
QuarkChain Network. In addition, to utilize high-scalability feature of the QuarkChain
Network, an additional scalability-aware interface will be provided with features such
as which shard the contractis being executed and sending smart contract specific data
via different shards.

6.3 Account Management

Since a user can manage all addresses in all shards via a private key, a user will
essentially have the same number of addresses as the number of shards. If the number
of shards is large (e.g., thousands or tens of thousands), a user may have multiple
balances in multiple shards, and thus managing all balance in all shards can be
inconvenient. The account management of the QuarkChain Network has been further
simplified by defining the following two types of accounts:

@ Primary account: Primary account is the address of the user in a default shard

®@ Secondary account: Secondary account manages the rest of the addresses of the
user in the rest of the shards.

To simplify management, most transactions of a user will be initiated from the primary
account, temporarily move to an address in the secondary account if the transaction
requires it (e.g., smart contract in different shards), and if there is remaining balance in
secondary account after the transaction, the balance will be moved back to the
primary account. This ensures that the balance of the user should be in the primary
account most of time, and thus the user does not need to manage the balances in the
addresses of secondary account. This feature is enabled by smart wallet, which will be
provided by QuarkChain team as an open source project.
)XX{ QuarkChain

6.4 Smart Wallet

There are two typical transactions on the QuarkChain Network:

& Transfer some tokens associated with an address to another address which may
be in the same shard or not

© Execute a smart contract in a specific shard

Smart wallet will simplify account management when using these transactions so
that a user does not need to be aware of the underlying detailed in-shard/cross-
shard operations:

© Fora transfer transaction, smart wallet will automatically detect the primary
account of a user (the address of the user in a default shard) and perform the in-
shard/cross-shard transaction accordingly;

© Fora smart contract transaction, if the smart contract does not exist in the same
shard of the primary account of a user, smart wallet will automatically transfer
the token to the secondary account of the user in the shard that smart contract
belongs to. The smart wallet will perform the smart contract transaction in the
shard. If there is remaining balance in the secondary account, smart wallet will
(optionally) automatically transfer the balance from the secondary account to
the primary account of the user.

7. The Ecosystem of The QuarkChain Network

7.1 Token Economics

7.1.1 Properties and Usages of Token

The native digital cryptographically secured utility token of the QuarkChain Network
(QKC) is a major component of the ecosystem on the QuarkChain Network, and is
designed to be used solely as the primary token on the network. QKC will initially be
issued by the Distributor as ERC-20 standard compliant digital tokens on the
Ethereum blockchain, and these will be migrated to tokens on the blockchain of the
QuarkChain Network when the same is eventually launched. As discussed above, the
main goal of the QuarkChain Network is to solve scalability problem of the current
blockchain based systems.

QKC is anon-refundable functional utility token which will be used as the unit of
exchange between participants on the QuarkChain Network. The goal of introducing
QKC is to provide a convenient and secure mode of payment and settlement between
participants who interact within the ecosystem on the QuarkChain Network. QKC
does not in any way represent any shareholding, participation, right, title, or interest
in the Foundation, its affiliates, or any other company, enterprise or undertaking, nor
will QKC entitle token holders to any promise of fees, dividends, revenue, profits or
investment returns, and are not intended to constitute securities in Singapore or any
relevant jurisdiction. QKC may only be utilised on the QuarkChain Network, and
ownership of QKC carries no rights, express or implied, other than the right to use
QKC as a means to enable usage of and interaction with the QuarkChain Network.

The key application scenarios of the QuarkChain Network will focus on financial tech
areas and game industries. The Token of the QuarkChain Network (QKC) will play very
important roles, as the medium of exchange for the QuarkChain Network. There are
several detailed areas of application for QKC.
|X| QuarkChain

Value carrier
The essence of the virtual currency is the value carrier, which is the most important
attribute of QKC.

Transaction currency

QKC is required as virtual crypto “fuel” for using certain designed functions on the
QuarkChain Network, providing the economic incentives which will be consumed to
encourage participants to contribute and maintain the ecosystem on the QuarkChain
Network. Computational resources are required for running various applications and
executing transactions on the QuarkChain Network, as well as the validation and
verification of additional blocks / information on the blockchain, thus providers of
these services / resources would require payment for the consumption of these
resources (i.e. "mining" on the QuarkChain Network) to maintain network integrity,
and QKC will be used as the unit of exchange to quantify and pay the costs of the
consumed computational resources.

Similar to Ethereum, each transaction on the QuarkChain Network needs to pay
transaction fee. Since the QuarkChain Network has powerful transaction processing
capability, transaction fee will be very low. Transaction fee only can be paid by QKC.
The QuarkChain Network supports smart contracts. A smart contract transaction of
the QuarkChain Network is completed by sending a message to the contract address.

Contribution incentives

As a peer-to-peer system, using economic means to produce positive feedback can
promote the continuous development of the system. QKC will be distributed as
incentives to incentivise the community to make continuous contributions towards
the system. Users of the QuarkChain Network and/or holders of QKC which did not
actively participate will not receive any QKC incentives.

QKC is an integral and indispensable part of the QuarkChain Network, because
without QKC, there would be no incentive for users to expend resources to
participate in activities or provide services for the benefit of the entire ecosystem on
the QuarkChain Network.
|X| QuarkChain

7.2 Business Development

7.2.1 Mobile Decentralized Applications (DApps2go)

The QuarkChain Network is built according to the belief that a DApp built upon on
mobile devices is more applicable and has more ecosystem value, based on the fact
that 4.47 billion people are using mobile phones and there is 68% mobile phone
internet user penetration worldwide in 2018. Mobile based DApps are very limited
today due to the low capacity of mobile networks which cannot deal with
blockchain data flow.

The QuarkChain Network has robust infrastructure to fully support mobile DApps
(Dapps2go), and its infrastructure design is mobile-oriented. Furthermore, on-
chain developer tools will be provided to create an Android-friendly environment,
making DApps2go development as simple as possible. A significant amount of QKC
as incentives for developers who adopt and build their DApps on the QuarkChain
Network. Our easy scale-out blockchain technology makes social network, online
storage, gaming and sharing economic platforms on blockchain possible. For
instance, developers could build a completely decentralized peer to peer share
riding DApp on the QuarkChain Network. It can easily handle 7.4-billion rides per
year—a number completed by the largest ride sharing company in the world in
2017—while removing the ride sharing central authority to lower the cost of using
ride sharing for customers. The QuarkChain Network is projected to be an ideal
platform to build sharing economy businesses.

7.2.2 Minimum Viable Products with Onchain Fast Evolution

The QuarkChain Network aims to shorten product development cycles by adopting
build-measure-learn feedback loop from the lean startup methodology. Thus,
developers have been allowed to run minimal viable products on-chain. With
great support from the high transaction processing capability of the QuarkChain
Network, developers can deploy and test their products on the main-net with quick
feedback collection. An Onchain Demo Show zone on the main-net of the
QuarkChain Network will provide ultra- smooth and fast testing experience to help
product managers and developers of DApps validate their ideas rapidly.

7.2.3 Demand Oriented Business Scenario

The QuarkChain Network brings real business into blockchain world. Such businesses
must have strong needs for high throughput blockchain, and be able to solve existing
customer or business demands. A good scenario is authentication, which is full of
challenging and cost-inefficient. Existing technologies, such as high anti-
counterfeiting technologies behind the national identification documents, can be too
expensive for small to medium business to adopt. With the help of the decentralized
ledger and advanced cryptographic protected private key of the QuarkChain Network
itis believed that there can be DApps to support small business owners by providing
an affordable and easy handling anti-counterfeit solution. This solution can also be
used for education systems for validating diplomas and laboratory raw data. The
QuarkChain Network will always be open and collaborative with such businesses, and
will partner with them to leverage and scale up their business.

With the lean start-up philosophy in mind, we carefully select business partners from
2-5 different industries where high-throughput blockchain can maximize its
utilization. The current business partners are listed below:

7.2.4 The QuarkChain Network for Internet of Things

Although it is still under investigation, blockchain has shown a great potential to be
applied for Internet of Things (loT). Using blockchain can reduce the cost of money
transfer and also helps the rapid realization of the value of loT transfer. However, loT
usually contains a large number of devices and there may be a large number of
transactions simultaneously. The QuarkChain Network will play an important role asa
platform to support loT applications with a large number of low-cost devices and
speedy transactions. The usage of smart contracts can also realize the automatic data
collection and processing and thus build more applications.

7.2.5 The QuarkChain Network for Al and Big Data

Blockchain provides a digital platform for economic transactions and thus it is highly
related to artificial intelligence (Al). There are many aspects that blockchain can use Al
technologies. For example, through reinforcement learning, sharding can be more
efficient so that the common trading clients can be allocated in one shard or at least
closer shards to reduce the transaction cost. However, this requires the blockchain
design to include the reshardable functionality and the QuarkChain Network offers this
function exactly.

Blockchain genuinely relates to big data and it generates temporal and space domain
data. As blockchain grows, the amount of data increases fast. No matter it is private
chain or public chain, these data will generate great value for the company or the whole
world’ s economy. Built on the platform of the QuarkChain Network, many data
mining algorithms can be developed and economic models can be developed. The
QuarkChain Network is open to collaborate with data analysts and economists to
develop new economic models and also this analysis will bring back valuable feedback
to further enhance the design of the QuarkChain Network with higher efficiency.

RISK FACTORS

The acquisition of virtual currency or tokens, including QKC issued by as set forth in this
Whitepaper, involves a high degree of risk, including but not limited to the risks described
below. Prior to any purchase of QKC, prospective participants (“Prospective Participants” or
“you”) should carefully consider the following risk factors and the other information contained
in this Whitepaper. In particular, Prospective Participants should carefully consider and
evaluate all risks and uncertainties associated with the current initial coin offering (the
“QuarkChain ICO”) and the sale and purchase of QKC.

The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known
to us may also adversely affect the QuarkChain Network should such risks subsequently
materialize. If any of the following risks actually occur, the maintenance and level of usage of
QKC may be severely affected as well. In such cases, the trading price of QKC (in the event they
are listed on cryptocurrency exchange(s)) may decline due to the materialization of such risks.
As a result, you may lose all or part of your investment.

This Whitepaper also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
The actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking
statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks faced by us described below.

RISKS RELATED TO PARTICIPATION IN THE QUARKCHAIN ICO

The QUARKCHAIN ICO may not result in an active or liquid market for QKC

¢ There is currently no public market for QKC. While the Foundation (and its affiliates)
will use reasonable endeavours to seek the admission of QKC for trading on
cryptocurrency exchange(s), there is no guarantee that QKC will receive approval for
admission to trading on any such cryptocurrency exchange(s).

¢ Furthermore, even if QKC are admitted to trading by cryptocurrency exchange(s), there
is no guarantee that an active or liquid market for QKC will ultimately develop or even if
it develops, will be sustained. It should also be noted that QKC have no known potential
uses outside of the QuarkChain Network.

There is no assurance as to profitability in participating in the QUARKCHAIN ICO

¢ There is no assurance that the value of QKC may increase over time. In particular, there
is no guarantee that the market price of QKC will reach or exceed the original
participation price paid for QKC in the initial QKC sale pursuant to the QuarkChain ICO.

The value of QKC may fluctuate and be volatile

¢ The virtual currency markets are often volatile and suffer from periods of limited
liquidity. Once purchased, the value of QKC may be influenced by digital currency
market trends, exchange rate volatility and other factors. The majority of such events
are unpredictable and are not within the control of the Foundation (and its affiliates).
June 2, 2018

This may correspondingly cause the value of QKC to significantly fluctuate over periods
of time.

¢ Additionally, outside of seeking a listing on cryptocurrency exchange(s), the Foundation
(and its affiliates) does not and has no intention to take any further action regarding the
subsequent trading and circulation of QKC. Any subsequent trading of QKC will be
determined on a willing-buyer, willing-seller basis, based on the relevant parties’
reaching a consensus on its value. At no point does any party guarantee the liquidity
and/or the market value of QKC.

There is no assurance that the Foundation (and its affiliates) will obtain the necessary
funds from the offering of QKC proceeds

¢ The QuarkChain ICO may not reach the target sale amount and as such, the Foundation
(and its affiliates) may not have sufficient funds to execute its plans and/or operate the
QuarkChain Network, which may correspondingly materially and adversely affect the
business, financial condition, reputation, results of operations and prospects of the
QuarkChain Network. This may also result in the failure to create the necessary
momentum and increased usage of the QuarkChain Network, which may consequently
result in a decline in the value of QKC.

Future sales or issuances of QKC could materially and adversely affect the market price of

QKC

¢ Any future sales and/or issuances or simply the perception that such future sales and/or
issuances of QKC may occur, could have a material and adverse impact on the value of
QKC.

Negative publicity may materially and adversely affect the price of QKC

¢ Any negative publicity, whether justified or not, involving the Foundation (and its
affiliates), the QuarkChain Network, QKC and/or any key personnel of the QuarkChain
Team may similarly have a material and adverse impact on the value of QKC.

RISKS RELATED TO REGULATION AND TO THE VIRTUAL CURRENCY INDUSTRY

The laws applicable to QKC and their future development are divergent and emerging

¢ The regulatory status of QKC and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in
many jurisdictions. In particular, the virtual currency or token economy is completely
novel and subject to a divergent and rapidly changing regulatory environment. There is
currently an underdeveloped yet rapidly emerging body of law internationally
governing this area. The regulation of virtual currencies has become a primary target of
regulation in all major countries in the world. It is impossible to predict how, when or
whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulations or create new regulations
with respect to such technology and its applications, including QKC and/or the
QuarkChain Network. Regulatory actions could negatively impact QKC and/or the

QuarkChain Network in various ways. In particular, it is possible that such emerging
June 2, 2018

laws and regulations could result in unexpected transfer and/or other forms of
restrictions being imposed on QKC.

¢ The Foundation (or its affiliates) may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that
regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such
jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s)
to operate in such jurisdiction. After consulting with a wide range of legal advisors and
continuous analysis of the development and legal structure of virtual currencies, the
Foundation (or its affiliates) will apply a cautious approach towards the sale of QKC.
Therefore, for the token sale, the Foundation (or its affiliates) may constantly adjust the
sale strategy in order to avoid relevant legal risks as much as possible.

¢ QKC may not be resold to persons who are residents of other jurisdiction(s) where the
purchase of QKC may be in violation of the applicable laws of the relevant
jurisdiction(s). Accordingly, the Foundation (and its affiliates) cannot guarantee there
will be sufficient demand or liquidity for QKC after they have been admitted to trading
on cryptocurrency exchange(s).

¢ While the operation of the QuarkChain Network is currently not subject to any
regulatory licence requirements under any applicable laws. However, over time, the
applicable laws may change. As a result, the QuarkChain Network may need to adapt,
and (a) incur more costs to comply with regulatory requirements; (b) temporarily
suspend business in order to comply with such requirements; or (c) modify the manner
in which it conducts its business in the applicable jurisdiction.

Uncertain tax consequences relating to an investment in QKC

¢ Currently, the tax characterization of the purchase and sale of QKC pursuant to
applicable laws is uncertain. However, given the advent of technology, the relevant
regulatory bodies may ultimately choose to tax the sale and purchase of QKC. This may
lead to a reduction in the value of QKC in addition to you being made subject to tax
obligations. It is your sole responsibility to comply with the tax laws of the
jurisdiction(s) applicable to you.

The_use of experimental technology carries operational, technological, regulatory,
financial and reputational risks

¢ The QuarkChain Network relies on, amongst other technology, blockchain-based
software systems and smart contract technology, and QKC use cryptocurrency wallets or
other related token storage mechanisms. The technology is experimental and in a pilot
stage of development. The technology may be made subject to existing laws not initially
meant for said technology, or new regulations regarding blockchain technology-based
applications may be introduced. Such newly introduced laws and regulations may cause
issues and/or conflict with the current QuarkChain Network concept, which may
ultimately result in the need to make substantial modifications to, and/or lead to the
potential suspension or termination of some or all of the functions on the QuarkChain
Network. There is correspondingly no guarantee that the services and projects
described in this Whitepaper will not need to be adjusted or modified in certain

3
June 2, 2018

countries because of the then regulatory environment. It also cannot be ruled out that
some services will be impossible to provide in certain jurisdictions.

No offer of securities or registration

¢ The offer of QKC pursuant to this Whitepaper is not intended to constitute an offer of
securities or a solicitation for investment in securities in any jurisdiction.

¢ No regulatory authority has examined or approved of any of the information set out in
this Whitepaper. Additionally, no such action has been or will be taken under the laws
and regulations of any jurisdiction.

¢ In the event that the Foundation (and its affiliates) chooses to comply with the securities
laws and/or an applicable exemption from securities registration or other obligations in
any jurisdiction, such compliance shall be without prejudice to any position of, or
assertion by, he Foundation (and its affiliates) that QKC are not securities.

RISKS RELATED TO SECURITY, CYBERSECURITY, AND THE HANDLING OF PERSONAL
DATA

Dependence on computer infrastructure

¢ We are highly dependent on information technology. We are also subject to hacking or
other attacks on our IT systems. As such, a system failure would have an adverse effect
on the use of the platform. Despite the intended implementation of all reasonable
network security measures, the processing center servers are vulnerable to computer
viruses, physical or electronic break-ins or other disruptions of a similar nature.
Computer viruses, break-ins or other disruptions caused by third parties may result in
interruption, delay or suspension of services, which would limit the use of the
QuarkChain Network.

¢ Additionally, hackers or other malicious groups or organisations may attempt to
interfere with QKC and/or the QuarkChain Network in a variety of ways, including, but
not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil
attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, there is a risk that a third party or a
member of the Foundation (and its affiliates) may intentionally or unintentionally
introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure of QKC and/or the QuarkChain
Network, which could negatively affect QKC and/or the QuarkChain Network.

¢ Further, the future of cryptography and security innovations are highly unpredictable
and advances in cryptography, or technical advances (including without limitation
development of quantum computing), could present unknown risks to QKC and/or the
QuarkChain Network by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism
that underpins that blockchain protocol.

Potential loss of digital currencies and wallet risks

June 2, 2018

While the Foundation (and its affiliates) will implement reasonable security measures to
ensure that QKC can be securely held by the respective users, there is however no
assurance that there will be no theft of QKC as a result of hacks, sophisticated cyber-
attacks, denial of service or errors, and/or vulnerabilities or defects arising from our IT
systems.

Malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of experimental technology

As QKC are based on the blockchain protocol, any malfunction, breakdown and
abandonment of the blockchain protocol may have material adverse consequences for
QKC. Additionally, QKC remain subject to technical advances, such as the development of
quantum computing, which could present risks to QKC and the QuarkChain Network.

Risk of Mining Attacks

As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens based on the blockchain protocol, QKC
are susceptible to attacks by miners in the course of validating QKC transactions on the
blockchain. Successful mining attacks present a risk to QKC, including, but not limited to
accurate execution and recording of transactions involving QKC.

Disclosure of information

Risks Associated with KYC

Personal information received from QKC holders, including but not limited to, the
number of QKC owned, wallet addresses used, and any other relevant information may
be disclosed to law enforcement, government officials, and other relevant third parties
when the Foundation (and its affiliates) is required to disclose such information
pursuant to any applicable law, subpoena or court order received. At no time shall the
Foundation (and its affiliates) be held responsible for such information disclosure.

Additionally, as at the date hereof, the QuarkChain Network is still under development
and its design concepts, consensus mechanisms, algorithms, codes, and other technical
details and parameters may be constantly and frequently updated and changed.
Although this Whitepaper contains the most current information relating to the
QuarkChain Network, it is not absolutely complete and may still be adjusted and
updated by the QuarkChain team from time to time. The QuarkChain team has no ability
and obligation to keep holders of QKC informed of every detail (including development
progress and expected milestones) regarding the project to develop the QuarkChain
Network, hence insufficient information disclosure is inevitable and reasonable.

«

The Foundation (and its affiliates) reserves the right to conduct further “know your
client” assessment (KYC) on all Prospective Participants. Such KYC may be conducted
following the receipt of funds from Prospective Participants of QKC in the QuarkChain
ICO. In the event KYC is not satisfied (as determined by the Foundation (and its
affiliates), in its sole discretion), the Foundation (and its affiliates) may return any such
funds and refuse to issue QKC to such Prospective Participants.

There may be a security breach on the QuarkChain Network

¢ Even though all the data provided to the Foundation (and its affiliates) is encrypted and
stored in a secure computing environment protected by secure firewalls to prevent
unauthorised access, in the event that there is a security breach on the QuarkChain
Network, there is a risk that there may be a loss of users personal data. This could
materially and adversely affect the business, financial condition, reputation, results of
operations and prospects of the QuarkChain Network.

¢ Hackers or other people engaging in similar forms of criminal activity may attempt to
steal QKC and money raised from the QuarkChain ICO which would result in the
Foundation (and its affiliates) not having the required funds to develop and grow its
business. The Foundation (and its affiliates) has comprehensive security precautions to
safeguard QKC and money it raises from the QuarkChain ICO. However, in the event that
such a breach takes place, this could materially and adversely affect the business,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects of the QuarkChain Network.

RISKS RELATED TO THE QUARKCHAIN NETWORK

Intellectual property rights claims may adversely affect the operation of the QuarkChain
Network

¢ Third parties may assert intellectual property claims relating to the Foundation’s (and
its affiliates) intellectual property rights. Regardless of the merit of any intellectual
property or other legal action, any threatened action that reduces confidence in the
QuarkChain’s Network’s long-term viability or the ability of users to use the platform
may adversely affect the value of QKC.

Dependence on Management

¢ The Foundation’s (and its affiliates) intends to rapidly and significantly expand its
operations and it anticipates that significant expansion of its operations will continue to
be required in order to provide market opportunities and attract market participants,
which is necessary to provide market liquidity. The anticipated rapid growth may
present unique challenges to the Foundation (and its affiliates) management,
operational, and financial resources. The success of the QuarkChain Network is
dependent on its current management personnel for the operation of its business.

Loss of Talent

¢ The development of the QuarkChain Network depends on the continued co-operation of
the existing technical team and expert consultants, who are highly knowledgeable and
experienced in their respective sectors. The loss of any member may adversely affect the
QuarkChain Network or its future development. Further, stability and cohesion within
the team is critical to the overall development of the QuarkChain Network. There is the
possibility that conflict within the team and/or departure of core personnel may occur,
resulting in negative influence on the project in the future.
June 2, 2018

Competitors

¢ Various types of decentralised applications are emerging at a rapid rate, and the
industry is increasingly competitive. It is possible that alternative networks could be
established that utilise the same or similar code and protocol underlying QKC and/or
the QuarkChain Network and attempt to re-create similar facilities. The QuarkChain
Network may be required to compete with these alternative networks, which could
negatively impact QKC and/or the QuarkChain Network.

Force Majeure

¢ The QuarkChain Network may be interrupted, suspended or delayed due to force
majeure circumstances. For the purposes of this Whitepaper, force majeure shall mean
extraordinary events and circumstances which could not be prevented and shall include
acts of nature, wars, armed conflicts, mass civil disorders, industrial actions, epidemics,
lockouts, slowdowns, prolonged shortage or other failures of energy supplies or
communication service, acts of municipal, state or federal governmental agencies, other
circumstances beyond the Foundation’s (and its affiliates) control, which were not in
existence at the time of the release of the Whitepaper.

There is no assurance of any success of the QuarkChain Network

¢ The demand for, and the value of QKC is heavily dependent on the performance of the
QuarkChain Network. In particular, there is no guarantee that the QuarkChain Network
will gain traction and achieve success after the commencement of operations. In the
event that the success of QuarkChain Network does not eventually materialize, this
would likely have a negative impact on the value of QKC.

¢ Additionally, there is the risk that the development of the QuarkChain Network will not
be executed or implemented as planned, for a variety of reasons, including without
limitation the event of a decline in the prices of any digital asset, virtual currency or
QKC, unforeseen technical difficulties, and shortage of development funds for activities.

Disclaimer of liability

¢ To the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws, regulations and rules, neither the
Foundation (and its affiliates) nor its respective past, present and future employees,
officers, directors, advisors, parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents,
representatives, predecessors, successors and assigns shall be liable for any indirect,
special, incidental, consequential or other losses of any kind, in tort, contract or
otherwise (including but not limited to loss of revenue, income or profits, and loss of use
or data), arising out of or in connection with any acceptance of, or reliance on this
Whitepaper or any part thereof by you.

No Representations and Warranties

June 2, 2018

¢ The Foundation (and its affiliates) does not make nor purport to make, and hereby
disclaims, any representation, warranty or undertaking in any form whatsoever to any
entity or person, including any representation, warranty or undertaking in relation to
the truth, accuracy and completeness of any of the information set out in this

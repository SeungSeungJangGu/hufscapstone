6 ArdCoin - Whitepaper

Businesses across the world are shifting from a product-centered to a customer-centered strategy. Putting the
customer under the focus generates the greatest and lasting value to the business and, ultimately, its share-
holders. As an outcome, a large number of loyalty programs are available on the market today, but the rewards

are anything but liquid and do not have real value outside the single brand.

Many loyalty programs are launched by companies in various industries around the world on a daily basis.
However, most of these programs are identical in their nature and share similar features and conditions, which

are, most of the time, inefficient and hard to manage by the issuer and are annoying to the customer.

It is always nice to learn that you are earning points by purchasing items in a shop, ordering food in a restau-
rant, or flying on an airplane. But how do you redeem your points if you are visiting that particular outlet just
this once? Can | get cash instead? Why can't you just give your miles to someone you care about? Or what do
you do when you learn that your favorite airline stops flying? Why can't you sell your points? Above all, how do
you keep track of each loyalty card that you accumulated over the years and make sure that you redeem them
before expiration? Did you find it inconvenient to carry a load of cards around all the time?

Everyone must find it annoying to learn that the program was seized by the issuer some time ago or that

your hard earned points expire each year. By the way, did you know that any one of these companies can cease
their loyalty programs at any time and that they give no guarantees to their customers to honor their commit-
ments? And finally, why can’t we earn loyalty points while banking with your financial services provider?
These are the issues that we set out to solve in 2018 through our pioneering blockchain-based loyalty pro-
gram, ArdCoin. ArdCoin (ARDX) - is an innovative blockchain-based loyalty program that has been integrated
into a mobile super wallet which is backed by an existing financial infrastructure which includes banking ser-

vices, insurance provider, stock brokerage, investment banking and a pension fund.

Ard App offers e-commerce on top of financial services and is supported by a nationwide network of postal
branches. Ard Financial Group (Ard Holdings) is the second largest investor in Mongol Post alongside the Mon-

golian Government.

ArdCoin will serve as a blockchain-based loyalty program for all existing and future services offered by Ard

Financial Group and its subsidiaries.

ArdCoin is a ERC20 based smart contract issued by Ard Bit LLC. Ard Bit is a 100 percent subsidiary of Ard
Holdings, which is listed on the Mongolian Stock Exchange (AARD). ArdCoin can be found on etherscan.io
under the ticker ARDX, and is listed on its native Digital Assets Exchange (dax.mn), STEX, and Mongolia’s
first crypto exchange trade.mn from April 2019. All and any proceeds from the sale of ArdCoins by Ard Bit are
intended to be directed towards the provision of reserves and liquidity for ArdCoins. These reserves will be

managed by Ard Holdings.

Ard Holdings is a full-service financial services conglomerate operating out of Mongolia listed on the Mon-
golian Stock Exchange. Its main investments, Ard Credit NBFI (MSE: ADB), Ard Insurance (MSE: AIC), and
Mongol Post (MSE: MNP) were all IPO’d and listed on the Mongolian Stock Exchange over the course of the

past 5 years. Our mission is to become a leading financial services group in the country by fully digitizing our
services and delivering them using Mongol Post's network. Moreover, we are working to invest in Central Asian
and South East Asian banking and financial institutions to replicate and scale our business model in line with
our vision to become a leading fintech holding company in the region.

As of this writing, ArdCoin offers a unique investment opportunity in the blockchain space — it is a token backed
by a well-run, publicly listed and regulated financial services conglomerate operating in a crypto-neutral envi-
ronment.

Mongolia is strategically located between Russia and China and is called as the oasis of democracy in the re-
gion. Moreover, it is the vision of the founder of Ard Holdings and the Chairman and CEO of Ard Bit, Ganhuyag,
commonly known as Gan, to transform Mongolia into a new financial center. He coined the term Wolf Economy
of Asia in 2007, referring to the new development model for Mongolia which he envisioned.

By providing a safe and compliant gateway between fiat and cryptocurrencies via Ard Holdings’ unique eco-
system, ArdCoin resolves a central problem facing the industry over the course of the past decade.

This is not a standard utility token offering: this token is issued by a special purpose vehicle, Mongolia-domi-
ciled Ard Bit LLC, which is backed by the one the most successful Mongolian financial conglomerates. It's not
a brilliant idea that investors in ArdCoin are buying into; rather, they are entering into a top-level organization,
a well-run machine designed and managed by seasoned professionals in banking, capital markets and ICT/
fintech with proven track-record of excellent delivery.

10 ArdCoin - Whitepaper

The main problem facing crypto investors today remains the conversion of their crypto holdings into traditional
or fiat currencies or other assets while facing a banking system that appears hostile and unfriendly towards the

nascent crypto industry.

Ard Holdings is determined to respond to this problem by offering an exchange platform and a digital wallet,

which are to be integrated with our existing KYC and AML compliant banking systems.

Ard App is a super wallet by all measures: it was designed to be an all-in-one solution for everyone. Ard App
enables Al-based self-enrollment and credit-scoring, online banking, stock trading, foreign currency trans-
actions, cryptocurrency and digital assets trading, online access to insurance and pension products topped
with a seamless e-shopping experience. It is connected to the interbank clearing via Most Money PSP and
the Central Bank's Automated Clearing House. It is a unique product that, thus far, has no parallels elsewhere.
Mongolia is commonly referred to as an oasis of democracy on the Eurasian plateau and has a thriving econo-
my mainly based on mineral resources. Consecutive governments have announced plans to move away from
a heavy dependence on natural resources and diversify the economy. The Mongolian government has stated
its openness to blockchain technology and a digital transformation working group has been established at
the Parliament level. Despite seemingly volatile politics and unfavorable geographic location, the country has
managed to stay the course in terms of sticking to democratic values and market economy principles, despite
or because of being geographically squeezed between the World's two major antagonists - China and Russia.
The Tugrog or MNT, Mongolia’s currency, is freely convertible and the country does not have capital controls, in
sharp contrast with its large southern neighbor and, unlike its northern neighbor, is under no international sanc-
tions. China is by far Mongolia’s largest trading partner, with Russia supplying most of its oil and energy needs.

The management of Ard Holdings has a solid track record in conventional banking, having founded one of the
most successful banking groups in the nation. In the past several years, we became pioneers in blockchain and
crypto space with the CryptoNation Inaugural Forum in 2018, angel investing in startups, the founding of the
Blockchain Academy and Blockchain Association, launching of the country's first crypto fund and investing
our resources in various initiatives and projects. Extensive lobbying with the government and public advocacy
produced visible results, such as the establishment of a parliamentary working group on the nation's digi-
tal transformation and overwhelming public support for blockchain-related technologies. In 2019, Mongolia’s
government approved its sovereign bonds to be traded on a blockchain-based platform.

Privatization of state-owned enterprises has been ongoing since 1991, albeit sporadically, and is a major op-
portunity for investors in emerging or so-called frontier economies. The next phase of privatizations, which
was announced at the Mongolia Economic Forum 2018, includes partial privatization of the Mongolian Stock
Exchange (MSE), State Bank and Mongol Post through a public auction on the MSE that is of particular interest

to Ard Holdings, which already owns over 90 percent of the free-float of Mongol Post.

Ard Appis the country’s first universal digital wallet, which integrates traditional financial services, such as pay-
ments, loans and savings with crypto. Ard App provides access to an extensive platform created by Ard Hold-
ings that includes insurance and pension products, banking services, FX and stock trading, and day-to-day

ArdCoin - Whitepaper 11

online shopping. Ard Financial Group's digital banking solution is complemented by Mongol Post's nationwide
branch network. Ard Holdings owns over 30 percent of Mongol Post (MSE:MNP), in which the government
has a controlling 66 percent stake. Ard Credit (MSE:ADB) and Ard Insurance (MSE:AIC) were IPO‘d in 2018
and 2019, respectively, and Ard Holdings became a publicly traded company (MSE:AARD) through a reverse
acquisition of a traded vehicle in August of 2019. The National Privatization Fund, Mongolia’s first closed-
end mutual fund, rang the Mongolian Stock Exchange's opening bell on October 5th, 2020. The fund ticker is
"MSE: XOC".

Ard Financial Group is a diversified financial services holding company with the overarching goal of increasing
its shareholders’ equity through investing in and developing leading financial services and technology com-
panies. Our investment portfolio consists of companies such as Ard Insurance, Ard Credit, Ard Securities, Ard
Life, Ard Assets, Ard Management, Ard Bit, TenGer Systems, MEC Partners (ardshop.mn), Mongol Post, Ard
Holdings International, Ard Leasing, Ard Properties and Ard Realty. Ard App, Ard Fintech, ArdCoin, Ard Cash,
CryptoNation and Ard Digital Bazaar are proprietary digital products based on artificial intelligence and block-

chain technology.

ArdCoin

A total of 5.158 billion ArdCoins were issued by Ard Bit LLC on ERC20 smart contract platform in January 2019.
ICT Group was behind its development while its integration with the Ard Digital Banking app was overseen by
Grape City Mongolia, the country's leading banking solutions provider. Upon its launch it was listed on trade.
mn and integrated into Ard App.

10 percent of total ArdCoins are to be given to the Board, team, and developers and 5 percent will be allocated
to advisors and marketing. Another 20 percent was awarded to Ard Financial Group's shareholders in April
2019. 30 percent will be reserved by Ard Bit and sold to Ard Holdings subsidiaries for their marketing and pro-
motion purposes as customer loyalty points.

The cash proceeds will be used by Ard Bit for building up cash reserves and investments. The remaining 20
percent will be put into a strategic reserve by Ard Bit and Ard Holdings.

We revised our earlier proposition to double the amount of ArdCoins in circulation before 2022.

As of April 2021, ArdCoin trades at around MNT200 and we are finally getting ready for its international debut
with listing on one of the top global crypto-exchanges.
14 ArdCoin - Whitepaper

Intro to Ard

Ard Financial Group was founded by the initiative of the management of XacBank as an Employee Investment
Trust, or EIT, in September 2005, creating a foundation for Mongolia’s first institutional investment entity. It was
made possible by the United Nations Development Program and Mercy Corps, a US-based NGO, making a
donation of MNT600 million to the investment fund of XacBank employees in 2001. At the time of writing of
this whitepaper, Ard Holdings owns over 20 different companies and has grown to MNT250 billion in assets
with over 30,000 shareholders.

Under the new strategy adopted by the Group, rebranding into Ard Financial Group was initiated in 2013 and
the focus was placed on the development of Ard Credit, Ard Insurance, Ard Securities, Ard Life and Ard Assets.
By 2019, Ard Insurance and Ard Credit had been IPO'd on the Mongolian Stock Exchange and Ard Holdings
became a public company through a RTO.

In 2016, we successfully participated in the privatization of Mongol Post, a 100-year-old state monopoly, and
became its principal shareholder with over 90 percent of its free float. ln 2017, we added Ard Management, an
investment fund management company, and AraBit, which was

initially designed to enable cryptocurrency trading, to our investment portfolio. In 2018, TenGer Systems was
overhauled to focus on blockchain technology on top of its role as the ICT support and systems integrator for
the Group. Based on our belief that people should benefit from the wealth they help produce, and sensing their
general desire to become owners of their banks, we decided to offer Ard Holdings’ shares to the public. As a
result, Ard Financial Group converted into a closed joint stock company in 2015. By the end of 2017, Investor
Nation JSC reversed into Jinst-Uvs (MSE: JIV), a publicly listed company, and started trading on the MSE. This
served as a launchpad for Ard Holdings’ eventual public listing in 2019. Ard Credit, a flagship subsidiary of Ard
Holdings received a digital currency license from the Central Bank of Mongolia in 2020.

Ard Holdings ventured into the blockchain space by piloting bitcoin trading in Mongolia in 2017 and setting
up Blockchain Academy. We organized the highly successful Investor Nation and CryptoNation Forums. Ard
Holdings launched the nation’s first crypto fund under the name CryptoNation in 2017 and became the first
institutional investor in crypto assets in Mongolia. Mongolia’s parliament decided to modernize and implement
the digital transformation of Mongol Post with the aim of enabling the government to provide one-stop public
services through the Post. This move reinforces our belief that Mongol Post will play a key role in our ambitious

play to become a leading financial services provider in Mongolia.

ArdCoin - Whitepaper 15

At the end of 2020 CryptoNation was rolled into a publicly traded vehicle as well. ArdCoin was launched as a
loyalty bonus program for our customers in December 2018, and was introduced to the public in the second
quarter of 2019. It is used to promote new and repeat business with Ard Holdings and encourages people to
refer their friends to us. ArdCoin can be found on etherscan.io as ARDX or ArdCoin. It started trading on
trade.mn in April of 2019. In another interesting development, the Parliament of Mongolia is debating a Law of
Virtual Assets Service Providers submitted by the Central Bank of Mongolia and Financial Regulatory
Committee.

Decentralized Finance is a trend to replicate conventional financial structures without a centralized institution
overseeing them, making them accessible to anyone with a smartphone and an internet connection. In several
respects, the blockchain is a permissionless and transparent model for an API feed, allowing anyone with a
Web 3.0 wallet to freely access data and execute transactions. Different DeFi protocols hint at what transpar-
ent and scalable borrow/lending desks, pools, exchanges, and structured products could look like.

Bitcoin was created as a type of digital currency, a store of value, and a medium of exchange, according to the
original Satoshi whitepaper. The evolution to Ethereum and smart contracts has allowed incredible new func-
tionality to be developed on top of a blockchain.

Fees charged to middlemen and investment banks are replaced by fees paid to blockchain and protocol devel-
opers, and API feeds are free. And just this year, we've seen a surge in DeFi protocols, most of which are based
on Ethereum. DeFi currently has a total valuation of more than USD93.3 billion. Borrowing from DeFi service
providers, Aave and Compound, for example, have over USD7.3 billion in total assets under management and

have risen 30 times since mid 2020.

A marketplace-based DeFi protocol will need to master four core components in order to be a big
success:

1. Address an urgent need

2. A well-designed protocol

3. Scalable technology

4. Broad user base.

Given the current DeFi climate and yield farming trend, we recognize the importance of attracting yield farmers
early on to help bootstrap the debt pool and give users a taste of our protocol’s usability and ease of use.

Ard DFS will be a DeFi brokerage service operated on different blockchains such as Ethereum, BinanceSmart-
Chain, Solana - (Ard DFS multichain protocol) within the multichain Decentralized Exchange with AMM eco-
system. These are permissionless, inexpensive, and scalable protocols that democratize borrowing, lending,

and trading with leverage, allowing you to make the most of your money.

You can collect yield, borrow from peers, sell directly out of your pools, and leverage your trading against a
portfolio of assets with Ard DFS. It is different from other borrow-lending protocols in that it offers a more ef-
fective way to handle money in six ways:

1. The same collateral can be used several times. By concurrently lending out your assets and investing into
other assets, Ard DFS helps you to create yield on your portfolio.

2. Cross-collateralization is a concept that refers to the method of borrowing money from the protocol itself.
When you want to borrow other assets, you can use your whole portfolio as leverage, lowering your margin call
and chance of liquidation.

3. Pricing that is dictated by the sector. Instead of following a pre-set business model that

must be manually changed, the Ard DFS protocol is based on order books.

ArdCoin - Whitepaper 27

4. Yield farming by locking up ArdCoin, the protocol enables customers to earn rewards and generate profits.
5. Liquidity provider function which enables retail investors to lock-up certain cryptocurrencies to earn fees.

6. Automated Market Making protocol (token swaps, liquidity providing)

Traditional financial markets rely heavily on brokerage services. They put together a range of market partici-
pants—hedge funds, institutions, pension funds, insurance firms, asset managers, and liquidity providers—to
boost market performance and price discovery, as well as to promote leveraged trading.

DFS was developed to provide DeFi with the best features of this financial infrastructure.

Borrowing/lending is only the beginning: our goal is to make all of the conventional investment bank trading

and investment-related services available to everyone while retaining completetrustlessness.

To scale, a widely accepted, fully on-chain peer-to-peer borrow-lending protocol will require an underlying
blockchain with comparable transaction throughput. Which we believe the Ethereum ecosystem will be able to
provide our user base. The coming updates to the Ethereum blockchain will address all transaction fee issues

that the industry is facing today.

Decentralized finance’s composability works both ways. Since the Ard DFS protocol uses multi-chain block-
chains which include Solana, BinanceSmartChain and Ethereum-based DEXes, other projects who choose to

integrate or extend Ard DFS functionality can do so without requiring any coordination or permissions.

238 ArdCoin - Whitepaper

Ard User Base - Currently over 1 million

The best marketplace-based protocol designed for scale is useless without a healthy user base. Furthermore,
the majority of DeFi protocols have failed to attract end users. There are approximately 250,000 unique Ethe-
reum addresses that have ever used the most active DeFi protocols in the world. This is a small percentage of

the user base of traditional finance applications.

ArdCoin - Whitepaper

Despite the fact that the protocol is noncustodial, we take protection very seriously. Unaudited ventures with
subtle glitches that shut out consumer funds or are compromised clutter the DeFi community. To ensure proto-
col security, we will be collaborating with the world’s top four blockchain auditing firms. In addition, we have a

team of security specialists who are reviewing and examining the various threats we see among the DeFi smart

contracts.

The Business Proposition

Currently the management is contemplating to offer ArdCoin holders priority access to the share ownership of

the regional banking conglomerate upon IPO on the major international exchange by Ard Holdings.
ArdCoin holders will be able to benefit from any appreciation of ArdCoins in the meantime.
ArdCoin will continue to be used as a loyalty program within the Ard Ecosystem and other companies’ loyalty

programs guaranteeing minimum demand on the market. ArdCoins as loyalty points are budgeted for in all

group companies going forward.

Use of Proceeds

Ard Financial Group's strategic acquisitions fit in-line with its stated mission of democratizing
access to banking. We will be targeting privatizations by the government and controlling stakes
in financial intermediaries in the region.

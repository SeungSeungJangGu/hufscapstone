INT: An economy driven solution to improve the device

interconnection of Internet of Things

Abstract: INT will build a framework for machines
and devices, and create a token, which will be used to
facilitate the resource exchange between nodes and
heterogeneous links (different nodes may create
independent internal links). For example, a node may
make a request and pay corresponding tokens to request
other nodes (or links) to provide power, network, data,
service and other possible resources. In addition,
through zero knowledge proof (specific improvement
as necessary), optional masking may be conducted to

protect user privacy and improve security.

1 Preface

The Internet of things has developed rapidly in the
last a few years, however, concerns have been raised
for the standards of communication and data exchanges
among manufacturers, the interests of manufacturers,
user privacy, as well as fragmented model constraint on
he overall loT development.

It is expected that more than 25 billion nodes will
be connected on the internet in year 2020, however, if
he interconnection within the whole network is not
smooth, the fragmented Internet of Things would not

fully realize value of the nodes.

Without defining a common set of protocol

standards, seeking support from _ individual
manufacturers is but inefficient and costly. Through
decentralized and economy driven methods, it is a new

way to make standards for device interconnection.

1.1 Project objectives

INT is the acronym for InternetNode Token. INT
attempts to build a scheme that allows data and
resources to flow freely within the network and to
ensure user privacy in untrusted and decentralized
machine federations.

This paper is not a complete and detailed
specification, just a preview of the development intent
of the whole design, which attempts to propose

solutions, and through experiments and projects,

community support as well as _ confirmatory
development, to make the INT a viable solution.
Through experimental evidence, prototypes and data,
as well as responses to community suggestions and
comments, the content of this paper will be revised

gradually in the future.

1.2 Background introduction

Blockchain technology has proved its value in
finance and other fields, but we believe its best usage is
in the field of IoT. Highly distributed IoT field is
especially suitable for blockchain applications.

At present, there are several issues with current
development of IoT:

(1) Lack of standard

The IoT vendors are very diversified, each holding
their own data silos, so the information flow within the
systems is everything but smooth, while cross-vendor
access and liquidation is hard to implement.

(2) Inefficiency

Under the current IoT ecosystem, all the devices

are connected through central cloud — server
authentication. The connection between the devices is
handled through the central servers, thus the efficiency

cannot really meet the real-time needs of the IoT.
(3) Cost

The infrastructure and maintenance cost of
centralized systems, large servers, cloud service and
network devices is very high. While the number of oT
devices increases to range of tens of billions, the
additional communication cost also rises exponentially,
which will make the IoT solution very expensive.

(4) Security risks

Centralized network has very high security
requirements for central servers, and the security
vulnerabilities of IoT nodes will affect the whole
network.
Make A different world

(5) Privacy protection

Existing centralized networks can collect the
user's information at will, and after the user realizes the
value of their data, he or she may not be willing to just
accept the situation. Because the IoT systems have
more private information, including health information,
vehicle driving information etc., the centralized
network cannot be trusted to store that.

2 Project overview

The INT project stems from the Apache Mynewt
community practice.

The team initially tried to define hardware through
software to reduce the complexity of hardware
development.

However, even if we define the abstraction layer
of the system, how to form a unified ecosystem
between individual nodes is still a challenge. Later,
through the team brainstorming, the team considers an
economic way to drive the integration of different

systems.

INT is a kind of blockchain application platform
and interactive standard which is object-oriented IoT
and based on economic driving mode. The parallel
chain structure is used to form a distributed network
between devices, and a consensus algorithm is adopted
to guarantee the legal trustworthiness of the transaction
between devices. At the same time, different kinds of
devices can be connected to different parallel chains to
avoid the explosive growth of the total ledger.

The existence of INT can greatly reduce the
development difficulty of the application of the
blockchain of IoT. It can relay different IoT, form edge
computing networks, effectively circulate resources,
and accelerate the progress of loT popularization. INT
is designed as a scalable heterogeneous chain,
providing a relay chain platform on which a large
number of verifiable, globally consistent and consensus
data structures can be built. In other words, on the basis
of ensuring overall security and cross-chain trust, INT
is committed to making the IoT blockchain into a
TCP/IP, which

networking infrastructure _ like

imperceptibly affects people's lives.

In order to achieve these objectives, we must do the
following:

INT: An economy driven solution to improve the device
interconnection of Internet of Things

2.1 Software defined resources

There is a fundamental difference between
hardware development and software development.
Because of cost and design constraints, the hardware
resources are generally scarce, so when we want to
add additional costs and provide additional resources in
the hardware, it is relatively hard (for example, to
provide additional computing power and extra external
power supply).

So the problem we want to solve is not to provide
additional resources, but if the hardware itself is a WIFI,
or a temperature collector, when it needs to provide its
own value to other services or hardware, the
corresponding charging strategy can be proposed. And
the resources we are involved in, according to different
devices, are abstracted from the real world, mapping
existing entities (whether hardware or data) to provide
consistent invocation in the form of services.

There is no way to add additional functionality
to existing devices, but in a relatively hardware
ecosystem, perhaps we can allow the various devices to
open their own functions, so as to gain more revenue
through the economic-driven. Because the nature of the
standard monopoly is profit, and the tokens themselves
can provide profit, and because of the volatility of the
price of tokens, it may generate additional economic
benefits. Relative income is not less than absolute profit.

So we're going to try a new model that drives the
hardware to open itself up by sharing benefits, to get
profits decentrally, rather than through a centralized
monopoly.

2.2 Monetization of resources

In our definition, we need a steady measurement,
and we do not use INT in the settlement of the IoT, but
use GAS mechanism, which is similar to ETH. Because
devices resource settlement needs a relatively stable
measurement, the resources will be settled in the
following ways:

Price tag type: pay according to the marked price.

Metering type: Pay according to the timeline, or
other dimensions of subsection.

Competitive bidding type: Bid on all devices that
need to invoke the resources.
S

PAINT

Make A different world

CPP (Cost Per Purchase): Pay based on the end use
of the resource.

Because of the existence of smart contracts, many
traditional architectures which cannot be completed in
a way that can be taken here, and then implement
coordination and interaction, the specific way can be
agreed on the chain in the form of a smart contract.

2.3 Resource transaction configuration

Related nodes shall purchase resources in a semi-
automatic manner through a custom policy.

2.4 Privacy protection principle

There is also a particularly important problem in
the current IoT: User privacy. The user privacy
protection of IoT is extremely fragile. It is easy to
predict user behavior because of the large amount of
data collected by the sensor. Moreover, for the current
architecture model, even if use the OpenID to
implement user desensitization, as long as analyze
multiple dimensions, it is easy to reverse deduce the
identity of the user. To solve this problem, we try to
adopt our innovative Behavior Private Key (BPK)
algorithm model based on zero-knowledge proof

Chain C INT

interconnection of Internet of Things

algorithm, by passing the user intent (intent) to other
hardware, without the need to pass the user symbol,
which not only can effectively protect the user's privacy,
but also can resolve concerns about the loss of users.

Our innovative BKP algorithm model uses
unsupervised learning or strategy model and clustering
behavior, through zero-knowledge proof algorithm to
implement user desensitization.

This allows for the sharing of resources based on
intent between devices, and does not require users to
share data, which can effectively address user privacy
problem.

2.5 Security

Is the device likely to kill like a mechanical bee in
a magic mirror (Black Mirror)? This may not
necessarily be the case, but it must not be a rarity to
drive a automatic car to hit a person into death. The
security of the future IoT is the most important, and the
INT will try to filter the intent through the innovative
BPK algorithm, trying to ensure the user's security.

4 Service

Each machine node can shelve corresponding
SKU based on their own wishes, which is to be suitable
for different bidding, sales, distribution strategy,
authority strategy, forming self-discovery of metadata.
This layer is a definition of software services and an
abstraction of hardware services.

5 Trading market

A. Machine automatic matching

Through smart contracts and semi dynamic
configuration, for basic services, such as network,
power, calculation, self-discovery, implement plug-
and-play access.

B. Developer API trading market

For data and services, a trading system is formed
in the cloud.

6 INT token

INT token will take a two-tier structure. The first
tier is the traditional token structure that participates in
exchange transactions and can be understood as an INT
share. The second tier uses the first tier token structure,
launches a timed auction and float aiming at fiat money,
mainly to solve the problem of token volatility, reduce
volatility which is easy billing.

7 Machine node

A node may be a traditional PC server node, or a
STM32 node that is configured tailoring according to
machine performance. IoT is a typical edge fog
computing scenario (Fog Computing). In fact, the
existing blockchain network is not suitable for loT. In
such a scalable network with high computational power,
how to share computational power, in fact, the core is
also economic-driven, so we need to define an INT
such a solution.

INT: An economy driven solution to improve the device
interconnection of Internet of Things

8 Consensus

As we known, in consensus algorithm, traditional
DPoS consensus algorithms have started evolving
towards the direction of centralization while deviating
from blockchain’s original intention of decentraliza-
tion. Therefore, we pragmatically create a new consen-
sus algorithm called Double Chain Consensus Algo-
rithm on the base of deep understanding into the core
of DPoS consensus algorithm and on the basis of INT
chain’s real application scenarios as well as current
development status of loT devices. The basic architec-

ture is shown in the following diagram:

Wherein, the “thearchy chain” made up of the
servers provided by device manufacturer, community
leader and ecological enterprise is the core of the entire
architecture. The “thearchy chain” consists of “thear-
chy nodes” which have come into being through mass
election by the method of community poll. Eventually
2n+1 thearchy nodes are produced, and their address
information is written into the thearchy chain’s genesis
block.

The primary function of “thearchy chain” is to

perform block-generation operation using the
dBFT/DPoS consensus algorithm and coordinate with
the work of nodes on the ordinary chains at lower
layers. Specific use of whichever consensus algorithm
is mainly dependent on the quantity of nodes on the
thearchy chain. We are using the dBFT algorithm in

the early phase of the project.

Following TXs will be retained in the thearchy
chain’s blocks: 1. Node grouping TX; 2. Node work
reporting TX, and; 3. Identity authenticating TX.
Among them, the identity authenticating TX is a key to
continuous operation of “thearchy chain”. The identifi-
cation information with signatures of n+] thearchies
will appear on the chain. Through this mechanism, the
system can approve new “thearchy nodes” to join in
the “thearchy chain” by vote or kick out manufacturers
that are no longer involved and thearchy nodes that do

not work as normal by vote.

Figure 2: Architecture of Consensus Mechanism Algorithm

Wherein, the “thearchy chain” made up of the servers
provided by device manufacturer, community leader and
ecological enterprise is the core of the entire architecture.
The “‘thearchy chain” consists of “thearchy nodes” which
have come into being through mass election by the
method of community poll. Eventually 2n+1 thearchy
nodes are produced, and their address information is

written into the thearchy chain’s genesis block.

The primary function of “thearchy chain” is to
perform block-generation operation using the dBFT/D-
PoS consensus algorithm and coordinate with the work
of nodes on the ordinary chains at lower layers. Specific
use of whichever consensus algorithm is mainly depen-
dent on the quantity of nodes on the thearchy chain. We
are using the dBFT algorithm in the early phase of the
project.

Following TXs will be retained in the thearchy chain's
blocks: 1. Node grouping TX 2. Node work reporting
TX, and; 3. Identity authenticating TX. Among them, the
identity authenticating TX is a key to continuous opera-
tion of “thearchy chain”. The identification information

with signatures of n+l thearchies will appear on the
chain. Through this mechanism, the system can approve
new “thearchy nodes” to join in the “thearchy chain” by
vote or kick out manufacturers that are no longer involved

and thearchy nodes that do not work as normal by vote.

In addition to the “thearchy chain”, the entire archi-
tecture will consist of ordinary chains which are made
up of IoT device nodes of various models produced by
numerous different manufacturers, and to which all

nodes on the “thearchy chain” will also belong.

The nodes on ordinary chains will continually read
the information on the “thearchy chain” during opera-
tion in order to work with high efficiency. The infor-
mation mainly includes:

1. Determine which node the next block will be
generated according to the “thearchy chain” block
generation information (Blocks on ordinary chains are
also generated from thearchy nodes);

2. On the basis of reading the “thearchy chain”
information, determine the group to which the current
nodes belong and then determine the block data that
will need to be saved as well as complete the data
fragmentation;

3. Read the legal manufacturers information of
“thearchy chain” and decide the data information
reported on other devices is legitimate or not;

4. Report the operation information of ordinary
nodes.
Make A different world

By this design, there remain only the IoT data
collecting TX and the scalable smart contract operating
TX among the main TXs of ordinary chains, while the
consensus algorithm logic and device/data legitimacy
judgment logic are both transferred up to the thearchy
chain, thereby boosting the stability and celerity of block
generation by ordinary chains while implementing data

performance storage capacity requirements for loT
devices becoming blockchain nodes.

Figure 3: Operational Process of Consensus Mechanism

The operational procedure of the whole process is
shown as below:

1. Thearchy nodes generate blocks through dBFT
consensus algorithm;

2. The normal nodes running on the server where
thearchy nodes are located generate blocks after the
thearchy chain generates blocks;

3. The ordinary nodes running on IoT devices read
the grouping information on the thearchy chain to deter-
mine the group to which they belong; loT devices that
access the network for the first time are also required to
register nodes on the thearchy chain;

4. On the basis of their own grouping information,
ordinary nodes on IoT devices select a thearchy node to
maintain connection for updating blocks and delivering
TX; Such design can boost TX's confirmation speed and
reduce the bandwidth consumption brought about with

TX broadcasting of IoT in narrow-band edge network.

5. On the basis of their own grouping information,
IOT devices can delete ordinary chain blocks that are

alien to their own group;

6. loT devices deliver the running log to the thear -
chy chain through node work report TX in order to
obtain salary income;

7. loT devices send ordinary TX to each other to
call functions or send collected data;

8. What is displayed, by default, on the INT brows-
er is the block information about the ordinary chain;

9. The INT wallet can submit the ordinary chain
TX to any of the loT device nodes or to any ordinary
chain node running on thearchy nodes. Standard TX
reproduced similarly by such means also supports

anonymous submission by using broadcast;

10. On a regular basis, the thearchy chain creates
device grouping TX according to the node information

of registered oT devices.

8.2 Calculation Separated from Bookkeep-
ing "Mining Mechanism"

After using the double-chain formulaic algorithm,
no loT device would have the chance to generate
blocks, so there is no way to earn rewards by generating
blocks. Although, from the perspective of INT's
economic model design, loT devices can earn incomes
by providing functions and reporting key data, we
design a set of incentive mechanism to reward IoT
devices (nodes) at normal work in order that the entire
blockchain network can operate more healthily. From
the perspective of implementation, the current scheme
being adopted for INT is the wage-paying mechanism
“contingent on device’s working conditions”, but we
give an umbrella name to such mechanism as calcula-
tion separated from bookkeeping mechanism in order
to make a distinction between it and traditional incen-

tives which are based on rewards for block generation.

The content of operational core of this mechanism is
shown as below:

1. On a regular basis, loT devices pack their own
working status into "node work report TX” to submit to
the thearchy chain. The working status includes "Device
Startup", "Device Shutdown", "Device has completed
xxx work" and other information, and extension is
supported.

2. Within a time period, working status of all devices
in the entire INT network encompassed on the thearchy
chain is recorded;

Application Layer-RPC +

INT: An economy driven solution to improve the device
interconnection of Internet of Things

3. INT would disclose a salary calculation
algorithm, into which the input is the records of work-
ing status of all devices within the current period
whereas from which the output is the payroll of each
device. Plus, INT would publicize the payroll within
the publicity period, whereafter the INT foundation
would issue INT token on the basis of this payroll. In
addition to the calculation of payroll, this salary calcu-
lation algorithm can also be iteratively optimized

during each period, thereby identifying any data fraud;

This set of mechanism also addresses the issue that
economic parameters of traditional blockchains are not
easily modified once set. Moreover, the openness and
fairness of core mechanism of blockchain are

safeguarded through the open algorithm and its input.

8.3 Extending Business Logic Using
Smart Contract

INTChain delivers a basic capacity, namely differ-
ent device manufacturers are allowed to extend the
smart contract operating on their own subchain. But
considering the hardware capacity of loT devices,
traditional virtual machine-based methods are not
employed to extend smart contract. We call such
capacity of extending smart contract TX of blockchain
as INT Contract.

The principle of INT Contract bears relation to the
implementation architecture of INT chain. The imple-
mentation architecture of INT chain is shown as
below:

INT
4 Make A different world

Each INT subchain is developed based on the same
chain SDK. But different subchains are allowed to
extend their own INT Contract at the TX execution
engine layer. Traditional development language
(JavaScript), instead of specialized smart contract VM,
is used to extend INT Contract and can run directly on
the OS of IoT, featuring high executive performance,
low resource consumption and applicability for the real
execution environment of IoT devices. Moreover, the
learning cost and engineering cost of INT Contract are
lowered with effectiveness with the use of regular

development languages.

8.4 Countermeasures against Puzzles on
Source Tracing along the Public Chain

Logically, it is impossible for matters in the physi-
cal world to be chained, so a numeric ID is required to
be fabricated for each “matter”, in such form as
number or QR code. But the correspondence between
such ID and the “matter” hinges on human factors,
which allows for considerable subjectivity and scope
for counterfeit. The reliability of tracing the source

along blockchain remains deficient.

Take Ethereum as an example. The smart contract
deployed on Ethereum is originally unable to access
networks beyond blockchain, even impossible to call
the Restful API directly in similar ways applications
are developed. Hence, data sources in the physical
world remain significantly inaccessible to blockchain.
This requires an automated tool that can provide
reliable data sources for smart contract of blockchain.
Oraclize Company promotes the Oracle tool which
ensures data are not counterfeited to a certain degree
through verification of TSL Notary.

The above description reveals that the core strategy
to cope with the puzzle in source-tracing application is
to minimize human participation and economic

motives for counterfeit throughout the process from
collection to processing to transmission-onto-chain of

key source data of “matter”.

The shell of INT chain will develop supporting tools
similar to Oracle for the smart contract module consti-
tuted by Software Fetch and Hardware Fetch to

INT: An economy driven solution to improve the device
interconnection of Internet of Things

provide reliable executive source data for INT smart
contract at software and hardware levels respectively.

8.5 Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol

The cross-chain interoperability protocol of the INT
relay-chain will fall into two parts: "cross-chain asset
exchange protocol" and "cross-chain distributed trans-
action protocol".

(1) Cross-Chain Asset Exchange Protocol

Extended over the double-chain atomic asset
exchange protocol of INT chain1.0, this allows multi-
ple participants to exchange assets on different block-
chains and guarantees complete success or failure of
all steps throughout the
this function, the INT Contract feature needs to be
exploited to create a contractual account for each

rading process. To implement

participant. For any other blockchain incompatible
with INT Contract, it
INT’s cross-chain protocols as long as a simple smart

can remain compatible with

contract feature can be delivered.

(2) Cross-Chain Distributed Transaction Protocol

Cross-chain distributed transaction means multiple
steps of an entire transaction whose consistency is
secured are implemented on separate blockchains. This
is an extension to cross-chain asset exchange, whereby
the behavior of asset exchange is extended into an
arbitrary behavior. In layman's terms, INT’s relay
chain makes cross-chain smart contract possible. A
single smart contract can execute different parts across
multiple different blockchains, which are either
completely executed or return to the status prior to

execution.

8.6 Packaging Methods of Blocks

Different chains may take either form of chains
generating blocks at high frequency and low time
consumption or highly densified blocks. So, different
packaging methods for enclosed blocks are adopted for
each parallel chain, and consensus is integrated via the
relay chain. The consensus integration part will be

billed by main nodes.
Make A different world

8.7 Network Design

IoT is such an extremely special network that there is
enormously great discrepancy between the requirements
for accuracy of delaying different protocols. So we will
adopt the MQTT method in respect of network architec-
ture and accomplish specific implementation and proto-
col amelioration for MQTT to fulfill the demands for
blockchain.

9 Application Scenarios of INT and
INT DAPP

With the growth of IoT devices at geometrical
progression as well as the improvement in the level of
intelligence of machines, there will be an increasing
number of automatically running IloT DAPPs to be
installed on smart devices and real-time, credible
automatic data exchange and automatic transaction will
be implemented between machines and between human
and machine via the distributed loT DAPPs.

INT will implement data transmission featuring
direct interconnection between nodes within IoT. loT
solutions would not require importing large-sized data
centers for data synchronization, management and
control. All operations including the sending of data
collection instructions and software update can be trans-
mitted via the network of blockchain. Some typical

application scenarios of INT are:
(1) Intelligent manufacturing:

Product transport, for instance, in which the products
can be traced, secured and delivered on schedule even
though cargoes are transferred through multiple material
flows; for instance, the data about production, inventory
management, sales volume of products and inventory
are all recorded in order to be shared between the
business and production departments, intensify punctual
production and boost efficiency of operation. Equip-
ment and systems in manufacturing are becoming
increasingly intelligent, thereby stepping progressively

into a completely virtualized world;
(2) Intelligent automobile:

The automatically running DAPPs in IoT enable

vehicles to change into smart application terminals, and

INT: An economy driven solution to improve the device
interconnection of Internet of Things

car owners can exploit blockchain to trace loT devices
(e.g. annual inspection of vehicle, automatic car insur-
ance tracing, etc.) Automatic traveling data exchange
between vehicles. For instance, the source map indicat-
ing traffic congestion transmits data for car owners to
keep track of the real-time traffic condition and imple-
ment automatic drive in a safer manner, automated

navigation of automobiles, roadside service, etc.;
(3) Intelligent finance:

In combination with the impossibility of falsification
and authentic right of data implemented for distributed
data of blockchain, the authenticity of data about finan-
cial agencies is secured, issues such as letter of credit,
corporate obligations and bonds, trading platforms,
giving quotation, contract fraud and order fraud can be
avoided, and traceability in financially safe network is
enhanced;

(4) Intelligent equipment:

Sensors are utilized to trace the conditions of bridges,
roads and power grids, even to help monitor natural
disasters in remote areas, prevent against massive
mountain conflagrations, disease and pest damages and
other grave catastrophes, implement smart urban
management, prognosticate urban greening and pollu-
tion conditions, and perform maintenance to share
high-efficiency urbanized management.

Different IoTs are relayed to circulate resources with
efficiency while significantly lowering the access
threshold on IoT, shortening the cycle of development
and reducing risks in application development. It will
be extensively applied in respect of intelligent power
grid, intelligent logistics, smart home, smart advertising
board, smart city, military appliances, etc. In intelligent
medical treatment, partnership has been achieved with
INT’L Medicine, a well-known leading domestic listed
enterprise in medical circulation. Having successfully
addressed such issues as resource waste in drug packag-
ing, environmental pollution and difficulty in ensuring
drug safety during transportation, the INT technology
and RSPS carried system can not only provide real-time
location information but also ensure safety protection
for whole-process traceable drug circulation, channel
end-to-end business data and boost the efficiency of
drug circulation.

10 Roadmap

INT aims to address the issue of value transfer in
fragmented and dispersed IoT markets. It will be a brand
new architectural platform at the bottom layer of loT
blockchain featuring decentralization, openness, open
source and high efficiency. In the ecosystem, different
participants can receive the profit at right cost and share
it with each other. There exists the bonus of fast devel-

opment in both domains of blockchain and IoT.

As a transparent and open system, INT is expected to
promote the development of IoT, without appealing to
unification of standards, to drive the interconnection of
different standards by economic means and to form an

effective decentralized market.

In the first step of the solution, we will release the
INTchain1.0 by the first quarter of 2018 and, on this
base, accomplish code reconstitution and stratification
to implement the double chain architecture and create a
new version INTchain 2.0 to be released by the second
quarter for commercial operation among multi- tudinous

cooperative clients.

In the second part, we will build the INT ecosystem,
integrate upstream and downstream enterprises and
scientific research enterprises in IoT, create open
hardware platforms, and apply INT in loT big data, loT
supply chain, finance, intelligent manufacturing and
more industrial domains.

13 Disclaimer

This document is meant only for conveying infor-
mation and does not constitute an opinion on the trading
of INT token. Any such proposal shall be carried out
under a trustworthy provision and with the permission
of the applicable securities law and other relevant laws,
and the above information or analysis shall not consti-
tute investment decisions or specific recommendations.

This document does not constitute any investment
suggestion, investment proposal or abetted investment
in relation to any form of securities. This document
shall neither constitute nor be construed as any behavior
of providing any buying and selling or any behavior of
inviting to buy and sell any form of securities, and it

INT has made it clear that users with relevant inten-
tions have had explicit knowledge about the risks of
INT platforms and that, investors, once involved in any
investment, are deemed as having known about and
accepted the risks of this project and being ready to
undertake every corresponding result or consequence
for their investment.

INT token is a digitally encrypted currency used on
INT platforms. When this paragraph is being compiled,
INT token remains unable to purchase relevant goods or
services. We cannot guarantee that the INT currency is
bound to appreciate, instead it may also depreciate

under certain conditions.

INT token is neither an ownership nor a control
power. Any control over INT token does not represent
the control power over INT or its application. INT token
does not empower anybody to involve in such control or

make any decision on INT and its application.

14 Risk Statemen

14.1 Risk of Loss of INT token due to Loss
of Certificate

Each buyer will have a corresponding INT account
after allocation of the INT token. The only way to
access this INT account is a related login credential
chosen by each buyer. The loss of such credential will
result in loss of INT token. The best way to store a login

credential securely is to securely store it in one or more
Make A different world

places rather than any public place or a place where a

stranger will show up.

14.2 Risks Associated with Core Protocols
of Ethereum

Before the launch of the main blockchain of INT,
INT token is developed based on Ethereum ERC20
Protocol. Therefore, any fault incurred by the core
protocol of Ethereum, unpredictable functional failure
or incurred attack will possibly cause INT token to stop
working or lose functions in an unexpected way. For
further information about Ethereum protocols, please
visit http://www.ethereum.org

14.3 Risks Associated with Buyer's Creden-
tial

Any third-party that acquires a buyer’s login creden-
tial or private key is likely to control his/her INTcoin
directly. To minimize this risk, buyers are expected to
protect their electronic devices to prevent admittance of
any unverified access request and any access to contents
in such devices.

14.4 Risks Associated with Judicial Regula-
tion

The blockchain technology has become a main
target of regulation in major countries and regions. If a
competent authority for regulation exerts influence, INT
applications or INT token will be impacted. For exam-
ple, statutes restricts the use and sale of electronic

tokens.

14.5 Risk of Lack of Attention to INT
Applications

It is possible that INT applications are not used by a
large number of individuals or organizations. This
means that the public is not interested enough to develop
and grow these related distributed applications. This
phenomenon of lack of interest may have negative influ-
ence on INTcoin and INT applications.

14.6 Risk of INT Related Applications or
Products Failing to Meet the Expectations of
INT Itself or Buyers

INT applications are still in development and they
may be changed significantly before the release of

14

INT: An economy driven solution to improve the device
interconnection of Internet of Things

official versions. It is possible to fail any expecta-
tion or imagination of the INT itself or buyers for the
functions or forms (including participants’ behaviors)
of INT applications or INTcoin. This can happen
because of any analysis with error or any change to

underlying design.
14.7 Risk of Hacking or Theft

It is possible that any hacker or organization or
country or region tries to interrupt INT applications or
INTcoin functions in any way, including service attacks,
Sybil attacks, guerrilla attacks, vicious software attacks
or consistency attacks, etc.

14.8 Loophole Risk or Risk of Vigorous
Development of Cryptography

INTcoin might be lost due to development of
cryptography by leaps and bounds or development of
other related sciences and technologies, like develop-
ment of quantum computers, or decoding risks brought

to encrypted tokens and INT platform.
14.9 Risk of Lack of Maintenance or Use

Buying INTcoin shall be considered as support for
and investmen'
the IoT rather

in the application and development of
than speculation. INTcoin may have
considerable market value in a certain period of time
and enable early investors to make promising earnings.

However, if the INT platform is not well maintained or

used sufficiently, such appreciation is not of much

practical significance.
14.10 Risk of Loss due to Lack of Insurance

Unlike bank accounts or accounts with other finan-
cial institutions, storage in an INT account or Ethereum
network is normally uninsured. Any loss under any
circumstances is not underwritten by any open organi-
zation or individual.

14.11 Other Unpredictable Risks

Cryptographic token is an emerging technology.
Besides the risks elaborated herein, there are also some
risks which are unpredictable by the blockchain indus-
try itself and the INT team. For further information,
please visit INT’s official website: https://Intchain.io

Definitions

[1] Bitcoin: Bitcoin is a virtual currency and it is not
issued by relying on a certain currency organization; but
rather, it is generated through a huge amount of comput-
ing according to a certain law. Bitcoin uses the distribut-
ed database constituted by many nodes in the entire P2P
network to confirm and record all trading behaviors and
guarantees security of all parts of the currency circula-

tion process by leveraging cryptographic design.

[2] loT: Internet of Things, i.e. network links
between things.

[3] Apache Mynewt: an open-source community
project promoted by the Apache Software Foundation
(ASF).

[4] Mynewt: a real-time operation system focusing
on IoT applications, including low power consumption
bluetooth (BLE50) wireless transfer protocol stack
NimB LE; latest stable version 100-b1.

[5] DAPP: Decentralized Application.
[6] DAC: Decentralized Autonomous Corporation.
[7] Distributed Ledger.

[8] Fog Computing: in this model, data, (data)
processing and applications concentrate in devices at the
edge of the network rather than almost all of them
storing in the cloud. It is an extended concept of Cloud

Computing.

[9] Hash: a classic technology in cryptography. An
input with a random length is turned into an output
composed of letters and numbers with fixed length
through hash algorithm.

10] Hash/s (H/S for short): a computing perfor-
mance parameter, i.e. the number of hashes processed
per second. 10OMH/S means it is able to process 100
million hashes every second.

11] Merkle Tree: it is a double-fork tree, composed
of a set of leaf nodes, a set of middle nodes and a root

node.

12] PBFT: Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance,

which is also known as the Practical Byzantine Fault

15

INT: An economy driven solution to improve the device
interconnection of Internet of Things

Tolerance algorithm consensus mechanism. It is a
consistency algorithm for message delivery, wherein
consistency is achieved through three stages to deter-
mine the final generation of blocks. In the case that
there are 3f+1 nodes, such algorithmic mechanism
decides f fault nodes can be tolerated to exist without
making any difference to the consistency result. Such
mechanism can be independent from the existence of
tokens. Consensus nodes can be constituted by the
participatory and supervisory parties. The shared delay
for 2 to 5 seconds can basically fulfill commercial

requirements.

[13] ZKP: zero knowledge proof, a concept put
forward by S.Goldwasser, S. Micali and C. Rackoff in
the 1980s, It means that a prover enables a verifier to
believe that a certain conclusion is correct without
providing any useful information to the verifier.

[14] PoA: Proof of Activity.
[15] POW: Proof of Work.

[16] POS: Proof of Stake. It is a consensus mecha-
nism upgraded from the PoW. It controls the duration of
mining based on how many tokens a node owns and
how long it holds a token; it can effectively shorten
mining time, but it does not avoid the issue of waste of

computing resources of miners.

[17] DPOS: Delegated Proof of Stake. For its princi-
ple, a token selects a certain number of nodes through
voting and completes verification and bookkeeping for
them. This consensus mechanism can significantly
reduce the number of nodes which participate in book-
keeping and verification so as to achieve rapid consen-
sus verification. However, it also relies on the existence
of the token and this limits some applications which do
not need the existence of the token.

[18] ERC20: the ERC20 Token is a common

exchange standard for ETH wallet, allowing developers
of wallets, exchange and other smart contracts to know

the way a new mark operates based on this standard in

advance. In this way, they can design their own applica-
tions to take care of these tokens without waiting for
any update to a new token system.

[19] ERC223: the ERC20 Token is unable to send
tokens to a contract which is incompatible with them.
This is the reason for why there is a risk of loss of some
capital. The ERC223 Token will introduce a new
function to the existing ERC20 standard to prevent any

unexpected transfer.

[20] Raspberry Pi: Rpi for short. It is a mini comput-
er of credit card size designed for learning computer
programming education and its system is based on

Linux.

[21] Arduion: a convenient, flexible and easy-to-use
open-source prototype platform. It includes hardware
(various models of Arduino boards) and software (Ardu-
ino IDE). It is developed by an European development
team in the winter of 2005.

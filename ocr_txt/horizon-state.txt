HORIZON STATE

Decentralised Engagement
and Decision Platform

It is time that the way society collectively makes decisions met the
expectations set by the rest of our modern world. Horizon State

has built technology whereby constituencies can be engaged with
immediacy, and results can never be tampered with. Our blockchain
voting system has been open to a national constituency and in use

since February 2017.

Motivation

We live in a world where the smartphones in our pockets have more computing

power than NASA had to get us to the moon, yet the way we govern our societies

and organisations remains the equivalent of a pocket calculator.

Existing models for collaborative decision making
once served our growing democracies well, yet today
they are increasingly slow, expensive, and ineffectual.
Public trust in their outcomes is eroding and results in
voter apathy. Campaign promises are regularly broken,
and major decisions are taken without consultation or
transparency. Our society is hurtling into the future, but
our democratic processes are stuck in the past, failing

to advance at the same pace.

Democracy is much more than our electorates, our
representative models, or our boards and management
teams. Democracy is the opportunity to participate

in the decision making processes that relate to the
shared matters which affect us. Democracy is about
reaching consensus on how to best use our shared
resources. Democracy is about advancing our collective
well-being, providing opportunities to those who have

while protecting those who do not.

We need better shared decision making tools and
processes in almost every facet of our community lives.
We need them to be transparent and trusted, allowing
deliberation and inclusion, removing barriers rather than

stacking them up. Technical, legislative and budgetary

obstacles have prevented us from achieving this thus

far, but do not have to hinder us any more.

These tools are now available. Thanks to the distributed
ledger technology we can create systems that directly
engage and empower constituencies, employing
mechanisms enabling them to vote smartly and
efficiently, giving them confidence that their voices

will be heard, and allowing them to see, first hand, the

results of their voting activities.

Horizon State has built this. Our platform is soon to be
extended and used by political independents, publicly

listed companies, and communities within developing

nations. We are looking toward brighter horizons, to a
place where our countries and organisations conduct
themselves with accountability and efficiency, a place
where voices can be heard securely and simply. We are
taking our technology to a global audience and it will
underpin the process of opinion and vote solicitation

everywhere, from the smallest councils in national

public service, to multinational enterprises.

It is time for our democratic processes to meet the

expectations set by every other part of modern life.
1 Vision & Capabilities

Horizon State has built a token-based blockchain

voting and decision-making platform that delivers
unprecedented trust through the integrity and post-
unforgeable attributes of distributed ledger technology.
Horizon State delivers a secure digital ballot box that
cannot be hacked, wherein results can never be altered
and voter identities are protected. Votes cast can be
counted transparently, in real time, by anyone in the
world. These counts can happen in perpetuity, as results
are permanently retained on the blockchain and can
never be changed. More than that - Horizon State allows
voters to verify their own vote is accounted for, while

maintaining their anonymity.

The platform promotes participation, facilitates

deliberation and creates opportunity for informed

decision making. It is a method to engage constituents
on matters that affect them with immediacy. It is a
framework where representatives can collaborate with
their constituency with unprecedented efficiency. It is
a method for families, communities, staff, and indeed
entire citizenships to inclusively participate in the

decision making processes that govern their lives.

Our product is already being used commercially by
MiVote, an Australian political movement featured in the
Financial Review’, The Guardian’, Fast Company’, ABC4,
and on Triple J®. Our early stage platform has facilitated
the casting of thousands of votes to the blockchain

since February 2017.

Horizon State now intends to take this product to the

world.

Our business development pipeline also includes
advanced discussions with a diverse client base,
including multinational NGOs, publicly listed companies,
and independent politicians.

This paper presents the platform that Horizon State has
built so far, lays out the token model we intend to use,
and discusses the road ahead, its challenges, and future
horizons.

Voting, the Blockchain & Decision
Tokens

The blockchain lends itself perfectly to casting votes. It
is an immutable public ledger, trustless, and inspectable
by all. A vote cast to the blockchain is unforgeable and

the voting results recorded on it are undisputable.

Horizon State is a blockchain-based platform and
ecosystem that enables efficient vote casting and
decision making processes. The platform operates
through the use of Decision Tokens (HST). These are
used for running the decision and voting processes by
providing the ‘gas’ for voting and other services within

the ecosystem.

Increase Participation by
Increasing Engagement

Voting, in essence, is the final act in the personal
decision making process. The overall voter journey
entails gaining knowledge and understanding of the
issue under deliberation, developing an opinion, opting
to participate and thereby influence the outcome, and

only then casting their vote.

Many elections today experience low participation

and high levels of voter apathy®. This may be due to
individuals feeling a sense of distance from the issues,
that the process of voting is too arduous, or can't really
see their own vote making much difference in the
overall scheme. This is true across the spectrum of
voter engagements, from general elections and local

councils, all the way to shareholders assemblies.

Beyond the voting platform already in use, Horizon State
is developing an immersive digital engagement and
deliberation platform which aims to overcome obstacles
to voter engagement and opinion solicitation. The
medium of participation will not be limited to computers
or handheld devices. Research and development efforts
are currently underway to employ capabilities based

on NLP (Natural Language Processing), Al (Artificial
Intelligence) and VUI (Voice User Interfaces - such

as Google Home, Microsoft Cortana and Amazon
Alexa). The results of this work will allow to us create

an immersive experience around the decision making
process - an experience where information delivery is
transformed. Static, passive fixed-content consumption
can be augmented by, or even replaced with, dynamic,

personalised conversations.

Building an Ecosystem

A truly great service enables synergy by being open and
inclusive. Horizon State’s philosophy aligns with this

by removing boundaries that hinder communication,
interaction and cooperation. We are building an
extensible platform that will allow us, as well as partner
developers, to deploy a variety of products and services
to the ecosystem that will further aid the processes of
decision making and voting, all of which will use the
Decision Tokens as the fuel for this ecosystem.

Horizon State aims to provide an extensible, pluggable
platform for decision making tools, processes and
applications. There are a number of decision making
systems used all around us, each of which has
different requirements: general elections, postal votes,
union elections, shareholders meetings to name a
few. In addition to providing a suite of services and
implementation types, Horizon State will be working
with partners and service providers to build dApps
(Decentralised Applications) on top of our platform.
Those dApps will provide services for organisations
using Horizon State to facilitate decision making
processes, improve deliberation and participation, or
provide customised registration and authentication

modules.

MVP Released

In early 2017, Horizon State’s blockchain-based voting solution was launched for Australia’s MiVote membership, using
it to participate in the country’s decision making process. The MiVote movement has run 4 nationally-inclusive polls in

total as of September 2017, committing thousands of votes to the Ethereum public blockchain through our product.

2.0 Decision Making & Blockchain

Deployment on the
Ethereum Blockchain

Robust Network: A secure vote is the most critical
component of Horizon State's technology, which is
why we have chosen distributed ledger technology
(DLT) to achieve this. Beyond DLT being our technology
of choice, our first commercial product sits atop of
Ethereum due to its network size and subsequent vote

security’.

Industry support and awareness: The Ethereum
Enterprise Alliance has moved the needle more
significantly than any other development in commercial
blockchain technology. Paired with the largest
community of developers in the world of blockchain, the
Ethereum ecosystem offers the most extensive pool of

resources to draw from as our staff count increases.

017, May 21). Ethereum is No’
ereum-now

ERC20 token standard: Standardised functions enable
seamless issuance, distribution and control of Decision
Tokens in a formal, uncomplicated manner. Conforming
to ERC20 standards affords us flexibility now, and

for unforeseen token applications and agreements

in the future. This flexibility will enable and promote
interoperability of our dApps both within our own

ecosystem and externally to 3rd party applications.

Addressing Existing Limitations

Ethereum’s production blockchain achieves
approximately 13 transactions per second, or 7 for
ERC20 tokens. While the current level of transaction
throughput would not suffice for national-scale
elections, Ethereum is the most well progressed
blockchain in respect to the implementation of

massively improved scaling solutions.

chain, Overtaking Bitcoin. Retrieved September 3, 2017, from http:/
aking-bitcoin

HORIZON STATE -Democratic tools for the 21st Century

Numerous changes to the Ethereum network which are
likely to commence in 2018 will significantly improve
transaction scaling. Technologies such as Raiden will
take us to over 1 million transactions per second, and
upcoming Ethereum releases will enable sharding and

proof of stake, further hardening the system.

Research and new developments in this area are
coming fast for the Ethereum development team. Their
latest scaling solution - Plasma - includes off-chain
transactions, and has the potential to allow billions of

computations per second?.

Features Tackling The Big Issues
Trust, Confidence and Security

There is an inherent element of trust when a secret vote
is cast. The voter has to trust that the chain of custody
of their vote is unbroken from the moment they cast it
to the moment results are published. Today, this trust
must encompass many intermediaries: centralised,
opaque data stores held by private enterprises;
automatic or manual vote counters; volunteers, paid

election officials, etc.

In the United States, where electronic voting machines
are prolific, it has been demonstrated that they can

be compromised with relative ease. In 2005 it was
shown that it was possible to hack into a Diebold voting
machine to change tallies’ in the time it takes to cast

a vote", while DefCon hackers broke into U.S. voting
machines this year.'’ Whitehat hackers showed it was
possible to alter individual votes, inject malicious code
into election servers and potentially exfiltrate voter's
identities and ballots, in addition to documenting
numerous electronic procedure contraventions with by

election officials during the 2013 Estonian elections.'*

The blockchain technology provides us with web 3.0:

a decentralised, democratised and trustless means to
deploy and consume services. This is possible largely
due to the power of smart contracts, which Horizon
State uses to deliver a medium for vote submission

and collaborated decision making processes. These
processes are delivered in a way that requires no trust
in any intermediary. Utilising blockchain technology, we
are able to store an irreversible and immutable record of
votes. As a result, opportunities for vote tampering are

eliminated, and the chain of custody can not be broken.

Horizon State's use of blockchain technology addresses
security of the vote, and indeed of broader kinds of
participatory commitments. As data stored on the
blockchain itself is tamper-proof, once the voter has
voted and checked their vote was registered, there is no
way to alter it. Where voter anonymity is a requirement,
the system ensures that it is not tied to the vote in any
way that is meaningful to anyone other than voters
themselves, who can check that their vote was entered

and counted correctly.

Anonymised Voting - Real
Implementation

The MVP used by MiVote entailed the separation of
the voter profile from the vote itself, while ensuring
that each user of the Horizon State system only

had the opportunity to vote once. The votes, cast as
transactions to Ethereum’s public blockchain, contain
no voter identity information. Their association to the
voter is anonymised and hashed to ensure voters can
not double-vote, but still allows users verify their own

votes.

technologies such as zZkSNARKs'° will open more
options for our development teams as we iterate upon

existing solutions.
Unencumbered Access

The process of planning and executing geographically
centralised or postal votes for communities and nations
is long - and infrequent as a result. On the other hand,
the gathering of opinions and casting of votes by
using modern content delivery systems, responsive
web interfaces, and mobile apps, enables efficient
setup and distribution models. Paired with blockchain,
a robust solution finally exists for sensitive decision
making processes and secure vote submissions that
need not be wedded to long and expensive methods
of orchestration. There is no longer any reason that
companies and governments cannot engage their
constituents as frequently as is required for better

collective outcomes.
Transparency

Traditional methods of voting provide no clarity

surrounding a constituent’s vote, whether it has been
accurately cast or actually counted. Our platform will
enable any individual to tally the number of votes and

which way those votes went, as the voting process

takes place. This record of votes will now exist in
perpetuity, will be able to be recounted with precisely
the same number of votes and precisely the same
outcome every time into the future for sake of posterity.
Additionally, voters can independently verify that their

vote was entered and was tallied.
Cost

In a typical democratic system using the methods of
vote solicitation (such as plebiscites, referendums

and elections) Horizon State's blockchain solution will
reduce the cost of voting by at least a factor of 10. As

a real world example, Australia will conduct a non-
compulsory postal vote on September 12, 2017, costing
taxpayers over $120 million dollars.’* Considering the
15.7 million eligible and active voters in Australia, this
equates to a cost of $7.70 per vote. Meanwhile the cost
of a federal election has risen to $227 million, or $15

per vote.'®

Horizon State’s MVP blockchain voting solution fares
significantly better when compared to traditional voting
systems. Our cost per vote - excluding the cost of initial
platform development - remains less than $0.50. This

cost will reduce further as blockchain scaling solutions
are implemented.

3.0 A New World

Decisions are rarely binary in nature, but our current
models often enforce binary choices. Horizon State's
platform provides the flexibility for non-binary voting

to accommodate the different needs of different
customers. The requirement for some decision making
processes will require votes that are split between two
or more options, assigning weights proportional to

the voter's feelings. Other customer needs include the

requirement to delegate votes to trusted proxies.

Horizon State caters for these scenarios, and others,
aligning the vote process with the values and laws of
the organisation running a constituent engagement and

collaborative decision making process.

Like-minded individuals or ad-hoc parties can
assemble groups or movements through the platform's
community module. This can work for people
demanding more support for refugees, or for residents
wanting to influence their local council to fix a sinkhole
in a side street. The power of joined voices will carry

into the system in the form of a stronger, united vote.

Horizon State will provide an integrated content
management and delivery capability designed
specifically to encourage discussions and informed
debates relating to the campaigns running on the
platform. This will provide a place for people to share
their views, debate with their peers, and continuously
engage in the process of voting. Smart artificial
intelligence engine and advanced use of bots will
allow voters to use their time efficiently, focusing and
engaging in-depth on the matters that are important to
them, while still keeping abreast of other issues voted

on.

As the content is generated by the organisations,
candidates and people themselves, no external party

can manipulate the information presented.

Candidates running in an election will use the system

to enrol themselves, present their beliefs and promises,
and engage with the voters. The candidates will be able
to use additional Horizon State capabilities like funding

or analytics to further their causes and compete more

effectively.

Horizon State will provide campaigns with multiple
options to define, identify and authorise the voting

population. The platform will use a PAM (Pluggable
HORIZON STATE -Democratic tools for the 21st Century

Authentication Module) architecture to allow different
organisations to use their own authentication
mechanisms (or any they feel meet their requirements).
This modular approach, in use throughout the system,
ensures compatibility with many different 3rd party

projects such as uPort.

Users will be able to control their level of engagement,
exposure and social impact. They will be able to audit
their own votes - present and historical. They will be
able to manage their personal profile on the system
(which can be anonymously used for analytics, below).
Horizon State will enable voters to share discussions or
issues they are passionate about on social media, find

like-minded individuals, and much more.

Beyond Voting

In Horizon State, a campaign is the elementary
building block of any vote. The campaign management
layer allows organisations (such as governments,
institutions etc) to create a poll on Horizon State. A
poll in this sense is the issue(s) being voted on, be

it a shareholders vote on members of the board or a

general election.

Horizon State will provide customers with the ability to
create a campaign, define the vote issues, questions
and processes, manage its content, advertise the rules
for candidacy, define the set of users who can vote

(constituency) and more.

As part of its operation, Horizon State will gather a vast
amount of data. Employing appropriate anonymisation,
the platform will provide users of different types with
information gleaned from this data. Vote analysis by
voter attributes, geographic or socio-economic slices
will all be made available. The analysis tools will also
let candidates and organisations run what-if scenarios,

testing policies and promises with real data.

The future of decision making aids is already here.
Both the internet and internal systems employ artificial
intelligence and clever bots to advance their agenda or
business. The applications we use adjust their behavior
to fit us. Customer service has been augmented in

many places by bots chatting to users, and data is

Copyright © 2017 Horizon State

transferred automatically between connected services,
to bring us what we want to consume, where we want to

consume it.

Horizon State will use those technologies to develop
systems to support individual decision making by
digesting, crystallising and presenting information to
decision-makers in the format, capacity and depth they
want. We envision that users will be able to create their
own bots in the system to gather information, display
notifications, and maybe even make decisions on their
behalf.

Democracy-as-a-Platform

Democracy and collaborative decision making have
many flavours. Each country, institution, union or
organisation may have their own interpretation of
democracy, and their own rules to exercise it. In
Switzerland alone, for example, there are 26 Cantons,
each with its own processes and regulations. There is
no one democracy to rule them all. Around the world we
see direct and representative democracies, presidential
and parliamentary, authoritarian and participatory, equal
and weighted votes - the list goes on.

Horizon State’s mission is to enable democracy and
participation that are in line with the various needs

of different customers. The platform is therefore not
opinionated, and unlike other alternatives, does not try

and shoehorn the different methods of practice into a
single box. We have taken a different approach - one
that provides the user with the tools to mold their own

flavour of the decision making processes.

Using Horizon State's platform and the capabilities
inherent with the development of smart contracts used
through the platform, a customer setting up their votes
can configure the ways the vote works in an efficient

way, using mostly a graphical interface.
Compliance and Regulatory

Requirements

Different jurisdictions have different laws, compliance
mechanisms and regulatory requirements. Horizon

State will enable users to define a voting flow that

horizonstate.com 11
HORIZON STATE -Democratic tools for the 21st Century

adheres to their processes. With some types of public
works, for example, the law requires notification

of the issue to be debated, then a period of public
submissions followed by deliberation before going to a

vote.

In cases like this, the user will be able to configure their
campaign to align with this flow, and provide irrefutable
proofs along the way that the process was followed.

Constituency

Not all voting campaigns address the same voting
populace. A general election engulfs the entire country,
while voting for a senate representative is limited to

residents of the state.

Shareholders meetings are for company shareholders
only, whereas membership in international
organisations such as the WWF (World Wide Fund for

Nature) - crosses borders and sovereignty boundaries.

Horizon State allows the user to define characteristics

of their constituency on a campaign-by-campaign basis.

Stages and Limits

Some votes have multiple stages, each with a different
set of rules. For example - in the French presidential
elections of 2017 no candidate won a majority in the
first round, and a second run-off round between two
candidates was held. While the two rounds had the
same constituency and were in essence the same
campaign - they had different rules and a different

set of candidates. Using Horizon State, the rules and
candidates can be modelled into a smart contract,
and using a preferential list - the run-off round may be

avoided altogether.

Flexibility

Administrations around the world use multiple methods
of voting. The US Senate for example uses both
blind votes and roll calls for different deliberations.

Companies use weighted votes based on their

Copyright © 2017 Horizon State

share-holders holdings, some organisations vote
regularly, many times throughout the year, others use

representatives elected at set frequencies.

Horizon State allows users to define the way their votes
will be run, counted and inspected. Full anonymity or
full transparency are both available, with degrees in

between.

Audit

The process of voting, especially when blind votes are
involved, can be mistrusted and contested. To address
this, and be able to trust that votes provide meaningful
results, institutions have audit mechanisms to ensure
regulations are adhered to and the votes are not
tampered with. Using the blockchain as an underlying
vote collection and counting mechanism provides
tamper-proof and visibility attributes to Horizon State's
solution. These capabilities can be further enhanced
by the users through the ability to add auditors and
audit requirements. These actions themselves are then

audited, as an inherent capability of the platform.

Transparency and Traceability

The nature of the blockchain is that transactions
committed to it are there in perpetuity, and both
organisations and their constituency can examine the
votes cast and their correct tally. Horizon State will
provide out-of-the-box mechanisms for voters to verify
that their own vote was cast successfully and tallied
correctly, providing adequate anonymisation when

required.

The platform will provide built-in audit function
encouraging transparency across its ecosystem of
services. A set of APIs (Application Programming
Interfaces) and SDKs (Software Development Kits) will
be provided as well, for users or software providers to
expand upon the basic offer. Enabling the building of
extra functions this way will allow organisations solve

any special requirements they may have.

horizonstate.com 12
49 Market Opportunity

New customers including political independents,
multinational corporates and non-governmental
organisations are currently being engaged. Each
customer using the system will drive significant
demand for the HST tokens which are required to

commit constituent votes to the blockchain.

Governments of developing nations, with citizens
numbers in the vicinity of 30 to 100 million who have
ambitions for innovation have been identified as primary

opportunities for the propagation of our technology.

While we have focused the first production release
on solicitation of votes with immediacy and security,
our technology is applicable to many organisation
types and many forms of democratic processes. HST
will not only be used for the process of running what

are specifically votes, but for the broader purpose of

collaborative decision making in many shapes and
sizes. This includes vote and opinion solicitation,

information delivery and constituent deliberation.

Immediate Relevance

In the last month alone we have witnessed numerous
major events taking place globally with significant
relevance to how Horizon State could improve the
status quo. Our platform tackles the big issues
discussed today: lack of security and confidence in the
process and system, lack of transparency, and high cost

of running voting processes.

Some examples where Horizon State platform could

offer game changing value proposition:

HORIZON STATE -Democratic tools for the 21st Century

Scenario Issue

Federal Elections” High cost per person/vote

Census” High cost per person/vote

Election Integrity

Horizon State is well positioned to offer the next-

generation platform for data collection systems
(Census) and election systems at a fraction of the cost

per vote.

Given the cost increase and latest system reliability
issues related to the recent Australian census,” the
Australian government is considering to move to a
census once every 10 years.

Horizon State represents incredible cost savings,
improved data and vote collection efficiency allowing
countries to run census multiple times a year instead
of once every 5-10 years, for a fraction of their existing
costs. Moreover, censuses can be run in parts,

across specific slices of the population, and many
other variations that may improve quality of data,

participation and results.

Security, confidence and trust

Recent Examples

The cost of federal elections in Australia has risen to

Examples of Usage Scenarios

#1 Poll: Should the Council Build a New
Dam?

A local government's water-works department wants
to build a new dam to service the needs of the growing
population and alleviate the pressure on the local
infrastructure. The site identified for the dam borders
on a nature reserve and some people are worried about
the effect building a new dam might have on the native

species.

The council may use Horizon State to poll their
constituents. They would purchase the HST tokens
from either the token exchanges or via a portal on the
Horizon State product, where the price of the token is
set by the free market. They then use those tokens as
the gas to power their voting on the platform. The larger
the number of people they want to poll, the more tokens
they will need. As there is a finite number of tokens
created during the ICO process, and no more will be
created afterwards, the laws of supply and demand will

dictate the token price.

#2 Shareholders Assembly - Vote on the
Board Membership

A publicly traded company needs their shareholders

to elect new members of their board of directors, and
confirm extension of existing directors. The company
buys enough HST to run the vote. The vote has to take
into account the fact that shareholders who hold more
shares carry more weight to their vote. It also needs

to allow voting by proxy. This scenario may use extra
modules on top of the core-voting capability, and use of

those extra modules will be paid for with HST.

#3 Party Vote - Show of Hands

The constitution of the Advantage Party, running in the
general election in Brazil, requires voting for the party
leader by show of hands. However, their members are
spread throughout the country and it is not feasible to
assemble them all in one place for a public vote. The
party uses Horizon State's platform to create a public,
non-anonymised vote. They also purchase enough
tokens to register 5 candidates, and each candidate
then uses more HST to use the deliberation and
campaigning modules. As the vote is run, members can
vote from the comfort of their home or work. They can
all be accounted for and their votes are public, as per
the constitution. Horizon State will allow party members
to inspect those votes while hiding the voters’ details

from the wider population.

#4 Mayoral Race

A city has decided to use Horizon State's platform to run
their local elections for mayor and council members.
Using the city’s treasury to buy HST, a campaign is set
up, candidates register, a deliberation platform and
several analytic and budgetary tools are configured to
assist in the election. The voting is open for a couple of

weeks, with constituents allowed to cast their vote as

Copyright © 2017 Horizon State

many times as they want - the system will only count
the last vote cast. This lets residents change their
minds all the way up until the close of the race, at which
time results are known immediately, with no need for a

lengthy process of vote counting.

#5 Public Submissions

A town has been approached by the local mall owner,
requesting consent to extend the mall by building

a second level of shops atop the existing one. As
required by law, the town should accept submissions
for and against the extension. Using Decision Tokens,
constituents are able to submit their opinions, inspect
submissions by others and deliberate on them

till a decision is made. A slow process lacking in
transparency and participation has been transformed

into an inclusive and clear one.

#6 Union Amalgamations

The leaders of the Electricity Generators Employees
Union met with the leaders of the Aluminum Smelters
Union - the largest commercial users of power in the
country. As the leaders found a lot of common ground
and interest, they decided to approach their respective
unions and suggest they amalgamate. As unions are
bound to consult with their members on any decision to
amalgamate, they bought HST tokens to cast a ballot of

all 110,000 members of both unions.

These votes are normally conducted as postal ballots,
with significant costs and administration overheads.
The vote count at the cut-off time was immediate and

the amalgamation was approved by members.

Now that the two unions have amalgamated, the new
super union will need to conduct a further ballot of
members to determine which union officials will hold

elected positions for the next term of union leadership.

#7 Non-Profit

A global non-profit organisation creates a campaign
on Horizon State's platform to poll their 100,000+
members and agree on the use of their 3 Billion dollars
in donations budget over the next five years. The

poll allows members to assign their preferences for
percentages of the budget to coarse-grained causes.
Once the poll is completed, the allocation of funds to
the various causes is done, based on the desire of the

membership.

Not all of the members voted, and the organisation
had some Decision Tokens left at the end of the vote.
As the value of the HST increased since the time the
organisation acquired them, they can now be sold
back to the market at a small profit - making the entire

process even cheaper than originally anticipated.

#8 General Elections

The government of a small African country decides
to take advantage of the high penetration of mobile
phones in their population and run the next general

election on Horizon State's platform. They white-label

Copyright © 2017 Horizon State

the platform's mobile apps for the election, and add

the political parties as candidates for the constituents
to choose from. Using the Decision Tokens for the
vote, people can participate in the election from the
comfort of their home, and are no longer required to
make the lengthy journey to the nearest available voting
station. Additionally, allegations of voter fraud, votes
manipulation and denial of access that were rife in the

previous elections, are no longer an issue.
#9 Census

Every 5 years, the national statistics bureau surveys the
entire population residing in the country for important
statistical information that guides the government
policies for the next five years. The requirements of the
census call for a very short window of time when the
residents are to complete the survey, and as a result -
significant investment goes into purchasing or leasing
equipment to be able to handle this load. Utilising
Horizon State's platform, millions of survey answers can
be cast in a very short time. Taking advantage of the
platform's API and SDK, the census data relating to a
single person can make use of profile attributes already

entered by the person.

Token Use

Horizon State will engage governments, large
corporations, blue-chip customers, local councils,
unions, education facilities and non-profit organisations
to promote the use of the Decision Tokens. We will
actively create products and services across the
ecosystem that will require the use of HST, thus driving

the token value and demand.

The cost of federal elections in Australia has risen
to $227 million, or $15 per vote.”' Our analysis of the
economic benefits expects Horizon State’s blockchain

solution to be 10-15 times cheaper per vote.

Horizon State's low cost-per-vote will attract
government departments and large corporates, enabling
them to run very high number of votes. This will drive
significant demand for the HST tokens which are
required to use the platform and commit constituent
votes to the blockchain.

Additional future modules will drive platform usage
even further. Crowdfunding functions, donations
management, staff and volunteer management,
events and campaigns management and actionable
intelligence platform are already in our roadmap to be
delivered in the near future.

Mechanisms of Supply & Demand

The Decision Tokens (HST) are a finite resource - with
the total amount of tokens ever in existence determined
during the ICO, up to a maximum of 1 Billion.

HST is used throughout the Horizon State ecosystem to
purchase services, such as the casting of votes. As the
breadth of services offered by the platform grows, and
as the number and scale of users increases - so will the
demand for the token.

From the ability to white label our app, to new module
creation, the extensibility of the platform will enable
additional features and services over time - with HST
being the core currency utilised.

>-9 Towards Brighter Horizons

The internet heralded a new era of opportunity for the
evolution of our engagement, decision making and
democratic tools and processes. Yet, with twenty years
of internet technology iteration, a system for internet
based voting that is secure, engaging and cost-effective

has not been possible.
Until now.

Our technology has become the first to enable the
recording of votes to a digital ballot box for a customer
with a public and national membership. Distributed
ledger technology now positions organisations and
governments to conduct decentralised voting processes
that are not only more secure than prior internet voting
solutions, paper ballots, and electronic voting machines,

but with vastly improved economic metrics.

Blockchain plays a critical role in solving the problems
that exist with traditional systems: security, immediacy,
transparency, and cost. More than that, our technology

shifts the constituent engagement paradigm, making

the best use of evolving democratic methods and

technologies for access.

Horizon State's vision is revolutionising methods for
our democratic processes. This includes broadening
discussions, promoting engagement, widening access,
improving efficiency, and reducing associated costs.

In that light, we exist to devise and design opinion
solicitation and voting mechanisms; authentication and
eligibility systems; education mediums; and information
delivery systems - all inspired by the blockchain
technology empowering them to be distributed,

unforgeable, and incorruptible.

Real World Use: Our MVP

On August 2016, Horizon State’s team commenced
development of the first commercial blockchain voting

product.

On February 10 2017, Horizon State technology was

membership began participating in the decision making

process on matters that affect the nation.

On March 2017, distributed ledger voting was enabled.
MiVote's second and subsequent campaigns have
seen constituent votes cast to the Ethereum public
blockchain. The MiVote movement has now run 3

blockchain-enabled nationally-inclusive polls.

Voter Access

The first release of our product was designed
specifically for MiVote's needs. The user experience of
casting votes as it exists today for non-parliamentary
matters aims to achieve frictionless access and broad
inclusivity. All Australian residents are permitted to
participate. Access to voting entails the sending of a

is sent with a relationship to a campaign ID, but without

identifiable relationship to the voter.

The system requires no knowledge or understanding
of blockchain to participate. The fees are paid by
organisations and institutions who wish to facilitate
these activities, and end users interact using a mobile
app - a product similar to experiences they are already
familiar with. Horizon State believes firmly that the
successful blockchain applications will be the ones
that stand as valuable utilities that require the use of
unforgeable ledgers. Users do not need to understand
the technical realities of the blockchain to use Horizon

State. They only need to trust in its promise.

Strategic Focus

While already in use, we consider our current offering to
be an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) only. As such, we
have a detailed plan of extending the product. Our vision
is to create a platform that provides many functional
layers on top of the voting process itself. Our roadmap
includes elements such as campaign management,

user engagement, deliberation facilitation and more.

Our strategic focus over the next 3 years include:

+ The continued building and commercialisation of a

modular blockchain-based technology stack.

+ Developing platforms for engagement, deliberation,

decisions.

+ Research and Development of innovative platform

extensions and functionality.

Copyright © 2017 Horizon State

+ Providing secure, pluggable mechanisms for

identification and authentication.

+ The creation of an ecosystem of 3rd party provider
plugins supporting social networks (e.g. Facebook),
commercial products (e.g. Dynamics CRM,
Salesforce.com, and Power BI) and collaboration

products (e.g. Yammer and Slack).

+ The expansion of our engineering team and

establishment of a global sales force and support

hubs.

The following dates indicate our aspiration to create a
platform capable of delivering the functions mentioned
above. It is our intent to be able to recruit enough

people to work on executing this plan together.

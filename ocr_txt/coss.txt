INTRODUCTION

This white paper describes the structure, functionality, and features of Crypto One-Stop
Solution (COSS), a cryptocurrency exchange platform launched by a Singapore
company, C.O.S.S. Pte Ltd in April 2017. At the time of writing, the COSS platform is in
beta, and its primary function is to serve as a cryptocurrency exchange. However, the
conceptual model of COSS is not just confined to a cryptocurrency exchange. It also
includes the implementation of multiple merchant tools aimed at the massive adoption of
cryptocurrencies in the future. We will describe these instruments in the chapters devoted
to the company's roadmap and development throughout 2018.

Through its services and merchant tools, COSS (a.k.a. COSS.IO) intends to improve the
overall cryptocurrency user experience. COSS aims to build a foundation for a
community of cryptocurrency users, companies, startups, traders, customers, and
merchants into a viable market, or an ecosystem that will expand with the implementation
of new features on COSS.IO. All of the components mentioned above in combination will
provide a stable ground for the mass adoption of cryptocurrency.

With insufficient user and merchant adoption of cryptocurrencies, low transaction
volumes, and consequently, low market prices, not enough viable solutions have been
provided to make cryptocurrencies user-friendly. The path from creating a digital wallet
to making actual payments in cryptocurrencies is still inconvenient, cumbersome, and
technically challenging. When addressed mindfully, these barriers can be overcome by
using a one-stop solution approach. A one-stop solution implies a single venue or
platform designed specifically to educate users about the variety of tokens on the market,
help individuals make informed choices, and provide multiple possibilities for digital
currency use, all in the same place. All cryptocurrencies listed on COSS are subject to
examination by us.

The primary focus of the COSS platform at this time is to improve the overall
cryptocurrency user experience through its services and features, and above all, its
cryptocurrency exchange. COSS approaches usability issues related to virtual currencies
in an innovative way, inspired by disruptive technologies and trends such as blockchain,
smart contracts, DAOs, token sales, and so on. The platform gathers the most popular
services and products associated with cryptocurrency into a single outlet. COSS allows
users to deposit, withdraw, buy, sell, and spend cryptocurrency safely, and to take
advantage of the additional services that are and will be continuously implemented on
COSS.IO to keep up with the fast-paced fintech industry.
COSS PLATFORM OVERVIEW

WHAT IS COSS?

COSS, or Crypto-One-Stop-Solution, is a platform which encompasses all features of a
digital economic system based on cryptocurrency. The COSS platform is made up of
core elements such as an e-wallet, a cryptocurrency exchange, and a native token.
Additionally, it provides related features and services such as market cap rankings, token
listings, and merchant tools (namely, a payment gateway or point of sale), a merchant
list, and an early version of a cryptocurrency-friendly marketplace. COSS aims to
facilitate the mass adoption of cryptocurrency.

GOALS

The principal purpose of COSS is to offer multiple services associated with the use of
cryptocurrency within a single state-of-the-art cryptocurrency platform and exchange.
The number of potential features possible to implement on COSS is infinite and will
continue growing as the platform evolves. COSS aims to offer its users a seamless
experience when accessing the available cryptocurrency services and products within a
single interface.

COMPONENTS

COSS aims to develop solutions to the global needs of the cryptocurrency industry in
general, and with particular attention to the demands of individual users who intend to
manage their assets online. The platform focuses on providing individuals with guidelines
for a smooth start in the cryptocurrency world.

The full COSS system comprises multiple interconnected applications that are available
to COSS account owners, divided into two main types of users: regular users and admins
(company staff).
The principal COSS applications are:
CORE APPLICATION

account management tools, registration
' and login processing, security features,
e password reset mechanism

Exchange

listing and
trading of the
most tradable
cryptocurrencies
and token pairs;
order placements Wallet

and processing — A alt storage of the tokens
\

FEATURES

The COSS platform currently includes the following features:

Cryptocurrency/ token/ ICO listings, a feature that allows coin
developers and owners to add their tokens to the Exchange and to
become part of the COSS ecosystem

Market cap ranking, a widget featuring an archive list with the
market capitalization indices, market prices, and the trading
volume of cryptocurrencies listed on COSS.IO

Promo trading, campaigns featuring the tokens
that have recently closed their token sales

Newsfeed that displays the most recent updates from COSS,
posts from the company's media channels, and articles
published by the leading cryptocurrency news

Merchant list, an early version of the COSS marketplace, on which
customers can find merchants accepting cryptocurrency
payments for their services directly via COSS
EXCHANGE

The COSS platform has an integrated exchange allowing users to trade cryptocurrencies
directly from their COSS wallets. The exchange back-end manages trading pairs
dynamically. New tokens and trading pairs are continuously added in accordance with
the community's preferences, and with the collaboration of token developers. Dynamic
fees are set for each cryptocurrency. Users can mark specific pairs as favorites.

For each trading pair, the exchange displays the following information: the type of
currency, the daily transaction volume of the chosen cryptocurrency, and price
increase/decrease over the last 24 hours.

The COSS exchange runs on a separate, independent custom-developed trading
engine. This trading engine communicates with the web server through an internal API.
The trading order is accomplished automatically based on the available requests on the
exchange in real time.

Every exchange occurs between two parties: the maker, who places his or her order on
the order book before the trade, and the taker, an individual who places a matching order
or accepts the maker's order.

The COSS Exchange offers both limit and market orders. Limit orders are executed
automatically only when prices match; if prices do not match, the limit order may never
execute. Market orders are executed instantly.

The chart below summarizes the differences between limit and market orders:

The order’ is
automatically
executed by the
engine if the
price matches

Users are required to
select a pair and
enter the amount and
the maximum (for
buying) or the
minimum (for selling)
price

The engine executes
the order automatically
and instantly if the price
matches;

The aggregating orders
from the exchange
generate the price

Users can choose a
trading pair and enter the
amount;

The system provides the
trading price automatically;
Once a user accepts the
order, it executes instantly

Orders can also be partially filled, which means that the order amount can be divided into
parts and sold to different people (e.g. a sale order of 100 Bitcoin can be split and partially
purchased by several buyers willing to buy 25 Bitcoin each).
WALLET

Every user on COSS automatically has access to an e-wallet which supports multiple
cryptocurrencies and FIAT. Wallet management functions include viewing balances in
each currency, making deposits and withdrawals.

WALLET TYPES

COSS stores funds in 3 different types of portfolios: hot, warm, and cold wallets. Savings
owned by COSS account holders are kept in cold wallets, while funds that are actively
used for transactions are stored in warm wallets, adding an extra layer of protection
against loss of funds. Hot wallets are used mainly for deposits and for temporary storage.

Hot wallet

Hot wallets are stored on
the platform in order to be
used for deposits;

These wallets hold funds
only for a limited amount of
time until the deposit
transactions are confirmed;

Once the blockchain
transactions are confirmed,
the funds are placed into
the warm wallets.

KYC/AML

For enhanced platform security, all COSS account holders are required to complete a
Know Your Customer(KYC)/Anti Money Laundering(AML) process. Account holders can
check their verification status on their user dashboard. Once an account holder has
complete KYC requirements, he or she will be able to activate their account and use the
platform. KYC is mandatory for all COSS users. COSS verifies all users before allowing
them to access their accounts on the platform and use its functions.

Our procedures are compliant with international “Know Your Customer’ best practices
as outlines in Anti money Laundering and the Combating of Terrorist Financing. Those
guidelines require the following:

COSS TOKEN

COSS was a 100% self-funded project that did not receive any external investments
before its April 2017 beta launch. It remained privately funded during its first months in
operation until the COSS token presale for early investors took place in July 2017. This
step was essential for the future development of the project, its expansion, and the
implementation of the new functions and features. A presale was followed by a month-
long token swap (ICO) for the COSS token providing opportunities to people who share
the COSS vision and believe in the project's potential. The name of the cryptocurrency,
as well as its ticker, is COSS.

The COSS token generates an entire cryptocurrency portfolio to its holders derived from
cryptocurrency transaction fees within the COSS platform. This process is called the
COSS TOKEN-BASED FEE SPLIT ALLOCATION (FSA), in which transaction fees are
split in half by the COSS DAO and distributed equally between COSS and COSS token
holders. Through this process, 50% of all transaction fees generated by the platform are
shared among COSS token holders.
The COSS token generates FSA in all cryptocurrencies traded on the platform. The
amount of the split allocation received by the user is defined by a smart contract based
on the amount of COSS tokens held. The fee split is allocated to COSS token holders'
dashboard on a weekly basis. Users can choose to distribute to their personal wallets at
will or allow it to accumulate on the exchange. Funds are generated by exchange
transaction fees.

The platform generates the fee split from the following sources:

COSS DAO

A DAO is a computer program, run by a peer-to-peer network, in which the governance
and decision-making are prescribed by the code or the pre-programmed set of smart
contracts. DAOs operate autonomously, without human involvement, meaning that the
code can provide direct, real-time control of the DAO and the funds stored on it.

Due to its decentralized governance, DAOs have no central point of failure, representing
a new generation of organizations and businesses that will evolve into Decentralized
Autonomous Corporations or Companies (DAC).

COSS DAO enables token holders to receive FSA from the COSS system on a weekly
basis due to a smart contract governing the process.

ARCHITECTURE

The technologies underlying the COSS system comply with the latest software
development requirements. With a combination of the best frameworks at hand, COSS
aligns with the most recent technology standards.

To manage client communications, we use the NGINX application to create the web
proxy server. The advantages of NGINX, such as managing multiple connections,
compatibility with a diverse range of protocols, and advanced load-balancing underlie our
choice to use the application.

The web proxy server communicates with front-end applications based on Angular2,
VueJS, and NodeJS. The communication is carried out via the HTTP2 protocol and
WebSockets.

The Service Layer manages the SSO (Single-Sign-On), 2FA (2-Factor-Authentication),
the messaging system (email service), user profiles, merchant profiles, wallets, and the
exchange. This layer communicates with a back office web application (through HTTP2
and WebSockets), the wallets (through Remote Procedure Calls), and the exchange
engine (via TCP and a Message Bus).

The exchange engine powered by Node.js is a fast, single-threaded application. The
back-office management applications are built using the Bootstrap framework and
Node.js, as they correspond to the latest technology standards and are widely adopted.

The communication layer between Geth and the front-end application is implemented
using Node.js, which uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model allowing it to manage
communications between the users and the COSS system. The Node.js application
communicates with Geth through IPC (Inter-process Communication), memory/pipe-
based communication between processes on the same machine. The Node.js
application shares the same server with Geth.

DEVELOPMENT

At COSS we aim to implement new features regularly while we pursue both our long-
and short-term goals for massive cryptocurrency adoption and the overall improvement
of the exchange and its functions.

Our goal for 2018 is to finish building a state-of-the-art cryptocurrency exchange,
implement FIAT functionality and become fully compliant applicable Singapore
government regulations. Once the above is achieved, we will be focusing on the Payment
Gateway/POS-system implementation that will take us a step closer to the goal of
bringing crypto to the masses. That will go hand-in-hand with reviewing the current
Merchant list, reopening the merchant application process, and building a viable digital
marketplace equipped with effective cryptocurrency-friendly e-commerce tools.
FUTURE PROJECTIONS

In a fast-evolving industry such as fintech, early adoption of innovation is essential. That
is the main focus of COSS. Our short-term strategy (2018 roadmap) in sum lists the
following steps:

upgrading the existing exchange

enhancing the security of the system

expanding the team

being 100% compliant with government regulations

continuously featuring tokens that will add value to the ecosystem
expanding our network and customer base

introducing FIAT deposits, withdrawals, and trading

Cryptocurrencies have all of the prerequisites to becoming a viable extension for FIAT
money over the internet, allowing millions of customers, including merchants, startups,
businesses, charities, as well as unbanked individuals to gain access to the most
technologically-advanced payment methods. For this reason, we at COSS focus on the
entire eco-system around cryptocurrencies, a borderless digital economic system
suitable for cryptocurrency users. In the long-term, the eco-system aims to eliminate
the challenges faced by the online payment industry via:

e offering competitive payment solutions to technology-oriented businesses and
startups in fintech and related industries

e providing all cryptocurrency-related needs in one place

e laying the foundation for a cryptocurrency-fueled marketplace

The list of potential industries which can benefit from using COSS is infinite. Just like
the internet, which is impossible to shut down, the COSS platform represents a ‘living’
project, or ‘a smart contract with no expiration date’ that can endure many technological
and social changes driven and inspired by disruptive innovations.

whitepaper

Swipe Wallet LTD, London, United Kingdom hh
ABSTRACT:

The original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was designed to be a peer-to-
peer cash system.’ Bitcoin's purpose originally was to be a digital
substitute to a cash payment instrument as described by the Bitcoin
Whitepaper’? written by Satoshi Nakamato. Since its inception there
has been a variety of cryptocurrencies® for a wide array of use cases
such as Ethereum and Litecoin that serve their own purposes, but
have the same fundamentals as Bitcoin, which is that they are
cryptocurrencies. There are processes to convert these hard-spent
cryptocurrencies to fiat but, there hasn't been a highly efficient bridge
to spend cryptocurrencies, as currencies, in which enables a peer-to-
peer cash system. Swipe will bring back the original purpose of
cryptocurrencies and enable them to be used as currencies and offer
its userbase a wide selection of services to bridge traditional financial
systems to cryptocurrencies.

Conclusion
BACKGROUND:

Cryptocurrencies original purpose was to be a digital cash
system. Since then cryptocurrencies have been used as a store
of value, fuel in an ecosystem, or used as securities. With these
new mix purpose functionalities, Swipe believes that it is
important that cryptocurrencies should all inherently have a
digital cash capability and have the ability to be spent. The first
transaction was actually quite expensive and maybe was a
catalyst of fear of not to spend cryptocurrencies in the infamous
pizza bitcoin purchase’. One of the first major companies to
build the bridge in spending Bitcoin was BitPay. BitPay first
enabled merchants to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment to
shop on their stores. The second product BitPay launched was
the BitPay Visa Card that enables their users to load a Visa debit
card with fiat funds converted from Bitcoin building the first
payment instrument that enables spending cryptocurrencies.
BitPay helped realize Satoshi's original intentions with Bitcoin
and it enabled a cash system to be used via a traditional Visa
card and between merchants who wanted to process bitcoin as
a payment method.

Since the launch of these two products from BitPay, many
companies are now attempting to launch products aimed to
make cryptocurrencies more easily accessible and useable in our
real world. Companies like Coinbase have launched trading
platforms that include fiat on/off ramps for users worldwide
through their website and banking relationships. Crypto dot com
launched a Wallet and Visa card aimed to make crypto top-ups
accessible to users in Singapore.
Many others have taken their sights to build bridges of
cryptocurrencies in everyday use with a constant growth of the
market capitalization’ as more usage, users, use-cases, and
more are released. Popularity has grown through institutional
entities now as well with the launch of regulated entities® such as
Bakkt. With these new products being released there are new
doors being opened to both financial institutions and also to
third-world markets, such as in Africa, to bring financial inclusion
powered by cryptocurrencies. Blockchain based
cryptocurrencies are designed by nature to be transparent on
the blockchain and to eliminate fraudulent transactions which
we typically see done by Credit Cards and Bank Accounts. In the
United Kingdom alone, it suffered over £600 million in credit card
fraud losses’. Cryptocurrencies by nature are designed to be
cryptographic and possibly prevent losses like this from

occurring in our markets.

Swipe strongly believes that blockchain technology and a
society where we operate without cash is important to growing
our financial sectors to the next step. The focus will be on
facilitating the adoption of cryptocurrencies to millions of users
worldwide by creating solutions that meet the standard of what
the expectations of the user audience is. Through understanding
the need of our user's needs, Swipe has studied the market to
understand the current landscape. A majority of the of the
volume and services provide to users are from a select handful of
platforms such as Coinbase, Bitstamp, and BitPay.
These platforms are known for their robust security, high liquidity,
and technical infrastructure which enables the services users
need while maintaining their level of comfort using these services
with trust and safety in mind. However, each of these platforms
has their specific niche market they target and don’t necessarily
offer the a’ la carte selection to bring a multi-use services offering
in one product or platform. The objective is to understand the
background of the market and how Swipe can come into it, at
this stage, and make presence will require the vision to be
executed in a fashion where we can offer a vast need of services
to users. Swipe will focus on offering a first-class customer service
with a secure platform that focuses on payments and serviced
tailored around cryptocurrencies.

ISSUES:

The current landscape of the crypto markets today lacks
companies that offer the ability of cryptocurrencies to be
actually spent. Currently there are only a handful of companies
that are approved to issue cryptocurrency debit cards due to
the issues done by bad actors. Prior to the crackdown, there
were issuers abusing their licensing agreement and doing cross-
border issuance without the necessary approvals. This caused
Visa and MasterCard to terminate relationships which left
cardholders stranded. Thereafter, it is a requirement from the
issuing schemes to get a necessary approval per region you are
issuing in.
The companies that are issuing with compliance in mind are only
in Singapore and a few countries in the Asia-Pacific area. The
companies issuing in the United States are limited to the assets
available and require significant licensing to offer their products.

With these issues and more there have been solutions
developed over the course of the last 5 years, bridging the gap
of bringing cryptocurrencies to our real-world commerce which
has slowly been established. However, custody and control seem
to be a common issue with numerous exchanges being hacked
for billions of dollars®. These exchanges and providers have
lacked the necessary infrastructural security to help protect user
assets and safeguard them from hackers and malicious
attackers. Some of these exchanges and providers have
suffered enormous breaches at the expense of their users.

Even with some of the newer providers who are aiming to solve
these issues they lack any incentive for the user in comparison to
other traditional financial platforms from cash back percentages
to actual bonuses offered. Some even have high entry of barriers
such as monthly maintenance fees, initial deposit requirements,

and limitations in services.
MARKET:

The overall market condition has allowed companies like Swipe
enter the ecosystem and offer products that will be actually
used due to a need of these services and selections of providers.
Swipe is a niche market with its planned offering of the Swipe
Wallet and Swipe Card. There are currently only a few other
companies offer similar products and from their overall offering,
they lack certain features or regions that Swipe will intercept
with its product offerings. Swipe believes that blockchain-based
payments and cryptocurrencies will become a tool for the
unbanked population — currently at around two billion people
worldwide. However, this technology not only benefits this group
of people, but at the same time, blockchain technology and
cryptocurrencies has changed the entire e-commerce
ecosystem by offering highly beneficial systems to both
customers and merchants in developed and developing regions.
The $3 trillion global retail e-commerce market is ever growing
with now more than 20% year over year. This market is currently
dominated by Visa and Mastercard but is being disrupted by the
potential of this new market of blockchain technology and
cryptocurrencies. Companies that can piggy-back off these
existing market-leaders while providing their own services will
propel their services forward at a much quicker rate than
someone entering the marketing with a completely new product
offering and no back-bone integrations to spearhead its
marketing.
The opportunity and features that these new emerging systems
provide will offer a substantially more efficient method of
providing instant and lower cost remittances and services
worldwide. Currently the market is in the need for a tool and
system in place to lower these transaction fees and offer the
same feel of services, which blockchain and cryptocurrency as a
whole can solve. The users in this market need to become aware
that Swipe will offer its product line in a cheaper, more efficient,
and more selective range of services versus its competitors. A
few ways that Swipe plans to do this are the following:

* Social Media Advertisements

* Search Engine Advertisements

* Press Releases and Media Articles
¢ — Influencer Marketing

* Aggressive Referral System

¢ Events and Trade-shows

* Global Meet-ups

4 INTRODUCTION TO SWIPE:

Swipe was created with one mission in mind:

19

Enabling Millions of Users access to Use Crypto

With this vision, Swipe will create a platform that will be
accessible to users worldwide via an Apple or Android device
which enables them to buy, sell, or pay with cryptocurrencies
at millions of locations worldwide. The plan to execute this
vision starts with creating a highly-secure bank-grade digital
Wallet infrastructure that will host multiple blockchain systems
tied to a traditional debit card. With these two products users
will be able to buy or sell cryptocurrencies to traditional fiat
and they may link it to their traditional bank accounts while
having the ability to store these cryptocurrencies on the
Wallet to spend it via the debit card at millions of locations

worldwide.

The ecosystem powering the product line will be fueled by its
native cryptocurrency Swipe Token (SXP), which will be used as
gas throughout the whole platform as gas. For every
interaction on the network it will require SXP to perform the

transaction similar to gas on Ethereum.
Swipe does not plan to stop there. The vision to “use”
cryptocurrencies will further grow the ecosystem and product
line to offer more traditional financial services tied to
cryptocurrencies such as lending, credit, and interest-bearing
accounts. Swipe will offer platforms an open-SDK designed to
scale services and bring Swipe features into more Wallets and
providers to access a larger userbase. With this vision, Swipe will
create a platform that will be accessible to users worldwide via
an Apple or Android device which enables them to buy, sell, or
pay with cryptocurrencies at millions of locations worldwide. The

SWIPE STACK - PRODUCT LINE:

The Swipe Stack is the short-word used to describe the
ecosystem and infrastructure designed by Swipe to offer its
services to users worldwide through its product line. With a
platform built from the ground up in stealth over the course of
mid 2018 to present day, Swipe has positioned itself with a
highly-scalable system designed with security and performance
to offer a unique payments experience for everyone.

When the Swipe Stack was designed, it was architected with a
forward-thinking model. The model we employ utilizes a cloud-
based microservice and infrastructure. This enables us to run
services that have their own specific responsibility and can be
easily maintained, updated, and duplicated without lengthy
downtime. The platform overall will regularly go through
penetration testing and audited while maintaining PCI DSS Level
1 Certification and SOC type II certification that will give Swipe
the gold standard of infrastructure security for its userbase.

6 SWIPE NETWORK

The Swipe Network is a proprietary system designed by Swipe
to provide real time market data, prices, and liquidity for
cryptocurrencies and within seconds convert them to local fiat
being used on the Swipe Wallet or Swipe Card. The Swipe
Network is also responsible for the interoperability of the Swipe
product line. There will be both on-chain and off-chain
versions of this protocol.

Swipe Network consists of:

system Swipe built from the ground up to ensure it meets alll
regulatory rules and procedures while ensuring smooth user-
experience and user safety. CAI processes a series of fraud and
risk rules to ensure frequently transactions and high-risk
transactions are being blocked with geo-location features. CAI
is also responsible for real-time automatic KYC directly built into
the Swipe Wallet and connected via the Swipe Network to
various global KYC providers.

Banking Layer: The Swipe Wallet is powered by a backend
banking layer to give users access to multi-currency banking
systems. Have this banking layer built into the Swipe Network
we are able to offer users crypto-to-fiat and fiat-to-crypto
services through our banking networks and providers. These
services can be used to make Wire/SEPA payments and local
payment channels like ACH where available.

Debit Card Processing System: This part of the Swipe Nework is
essential to operating the Debit Card connected to the Swipe
Wallet. This system allows users to control their debit card
directly from the Swipe Wallet and link it to the cryptocurrency
they plan to spend which will be converted at point-of-sale in
real time. It will also support the issuance of virtual and physical
cards with the adding to Apple and Google Pay digital wallets.

SWIPE TOKEN:

The Swipe Token is the ecosystems native cryptocurrency which
fuels the services that are performed on the Swipe product line.
The Swipe Token will be minted on the Ethereum Platform as an
ERC20 standard token. There will be in existence 300,000,000
SXP tokens as a fixed supply. The SXP token is designed with a
deflationary monetary supply as all transaction fees will consist
the use of SXP via the Wallet Smart Contract powered by the
Swipe Network autonomously with the code published publicly
and audited.

The way this mechanism works is that when transactions are
executed on the product line that involve fees, which will always
be fueled by SXP, 80% of those transaction fees will destroyed
while 20% of these fees will be retained by Swipe Wallet as
operational revenue. These transactions being performed by the
Swipe Network of these transactions will be on-chain and
verifiable on the Ethereum Explorer.
Each user will be set up with a Smart Contract that will require a
1 SXP tokens deposit to activate the contract and enable the
features of the Swipe Wallet. Thereafter when each transaction
is performed, the Smart Contract will validate through the Swipe
Network the percentage of fee is required to execute the
transaction. Initially this fee will be 1% and is adjustable by Swipe
to become lower, not higher. This fee is dynamic because as the
supply of SXP becomes lower over the course of its existence,
this fee will be required to be lowered respectively to coincide
with the monetary supply of Swipe Tokens. There will be a phase
2 governance smart contract designed to help govern these
Swipe Network adjustments.

Swipe Token Features:

¢ Up to 75% discount on fees

e Enhanced Rewards of up to 1% on top of existing card
rewards percentages

e Used as gas for the network fees on all transactions

* Can be spent via the Swipe Card to fiat at million of

The cryptocurrency market is ever changing and growing.
Companies, like Swipe, will position themselves to be at the
forefront of this fourth industrial revolution by offering a product
line tailored and aimed to offer financial inclusion to users
worldwide with as little as a smart phone and internet
connection. Swipe will build bridges used to buy, sell, and pay
with cryptocurrencies. The lack of systems in place today that
are secure and efficient will give Swipe popularity in choice

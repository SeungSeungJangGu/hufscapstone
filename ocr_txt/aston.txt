Introduction

1.1 Abstract

Most electronic documents are heavily exposed to vulnerabilities. Unauthorized agents may intercept
sensitive documents and forge or modify them, altering their original purpose. However, there are very
few services that provide reliable and secure electronic document authentication. Recently, blockchain
has been offered up as a solution for more reliable and secure electronic document authentication,
distribution, and management. While the current blockchain platform is capable of facilitating
document delivery and execution, it is ill-equipped to handle the storage and circulation of regularly
updated electronic documents at scale.

At ASTON, we provide a decentralized platform for the authentication of documents. Our technology is
developed using the existing blockchain platform, with enhancements that result in a cutting-edge
security solution. The X-chain technology developed by ASTON resolves the various problems present
in existing blockchain systems. We replace the traditional linear blockchain storage method with a
multi-dimensional blockchain structure, which makes digital document authentication significantly
more scalable. Moreover, the security authentication solution (Smart-PassOn) based on the public key
infrastructure (PKI) and the biometric signature authentication (FIDO) ensures an even higher level of
document security for users.

Currently, ASTON works with business enterprises and large hospitals in Korea to pilot its secure
electronic document authentication platform. In the near future, we plan to roll out a commercial
service for companies and organizations in all sectors. Our X.Blockchain technology will also have broad
applications in diversified fields globally because of its ability to outperform existing blockchain
technology.

The ATX issued by the sale of ASTON tokens will be used as the means for payment of usage of the
ASTON platform (including the platform usage fee, fee for issuance of documents, fee for storage of
documents, and so on). Furthermore, ASTON tokens can later be traded freely on cryptocurrency
exchanges around the world including Coinlink.
1.2 Background

To confirm the credibility of documents, generally a trusted third-party institution is involved.
Government agencies validate birth/death certificates. Hospital databases are used to verify
prescriptions for medicine. Business enterprises have a paper trail for every employment offer and
every employee resignation. Now, blockchain technology is well-positioned to replace the formerly
indispensable traditional third-party trust structure with its distributed ledger. In the 1990s,
innovation came when individuals and businesses could begin to create, store, share, and process all of
their documents electronically. The move from analog to digital was a major milestone in document
management. At the end of the 2000s decade, cloud systems made information storage and
processing available anywhere around the world, at infinite scale. Today, blockchain technology leads
the latest wave of innovation for digital documents, ensuring the credibility and validity of data
distributed on its platform. This removes user reliance on trusted third-party institutions to certify
documents, and its secure applications may mark a paradigm shift in the global trust structure.

As consumers and businesses increasingly adopt the use and circulation of electronic documents,
related services arose too, such as cloud document storage and online notarization. However, several
vulnerabilities remained including fraud and unauthorized modification. At ASTON, we recognized
these limitations and have been successful in developing a sophisticated platform that addresses
these issues and satisfies all users.

1.3 Vision

These days, important information is well-documented but it isn't always securely managed or stored.
Documents have evolved from their analog, hard copy forms to digital, soft copy formats. Of course, as
convenience rose in reproduction, storage, and movement, electronic documents came to assume
risks including fraud and unauthorized modification. Although online authentication and notarization
services cropped up to resolve these issues, they still reinforce the traditional trusted third-party
institution structure which most modern documents are tethered to.
TThe world we hope to create through the technology we build at ASTON is one whereby all
participants become active authentication agents rather than the simple users of blockchain
platforms. We empower our users to validate the credibility of the electronic agreements and
documents they use independently, eliminating the need to utilize services from trusted third-party
institutions. We do this by combining public and private blockchains. We intend to create a world in
which everybody can contribute and participate as a node of the blockchain.

1.4 Mission

In the near future, the certified hard copies of documents we have long relied on (e.g., school:
certificate of graduation, transcripts, certificate of registration and others; medical institutions:
waiting number ticket, receipt for medical treatment, prescription of medicines, record of treatment
and others; government agencies: certificate of birth, certificates of family/individual resident
registration, certificate of family relationship and others; private enterprises: all types of legal
contracts, certificate of employment, payroll schedules and others) will no longer be necessary. When
a visit is made to the hospital for medical treatment, when an interview is completed for employment,
and when a report is submitted for a newborn baby, users will no longer need to prepare anything to
verify the corresponding information. The corresponding information will already be available in the
ASTON platform, and the data can be accessed using simple authentication through ASTON. All these
requirements will be processed in ASTON, the platform predicated on X.Blockchain technology, and
each node will come to freely access, use, or change the information without geographical or
technological restrictions. This means the X.Blockchain technology we build can be expanded to
globally. Furthermore, this technology can be utilized in a more practical way in all types of industries
where a mutual trust relationship is required; the immediate application is possible without a
third-party intermediary. In the near future, people everywhere will live their lives within the ecosystem
created by ASTON and we will continue to innovate to provide more valuable solutions and tools for our
users.

[Global Ecosystem for Circulation of Electronic Assets]

2.1 Definition of Aston

ASTON is a platform for the authentication of documents based on blockchain technology. Though
many different types of electronic documents exist, they are generally authenticated offline. If linear
blockchains are used, online authentication is theoretically possible but may be impractical in reality.
Online authentication would require the storage of large amounts of data, which can be difficult to
support for many users, Perfect decentralization with linear blockchains is impossible with a limited
number of devices and low storage capacity. To create a better user experience in which documents
can be authenticated without the intervention of a trusted third-party institution, the platform we
develop must make documents easy to execute on all desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

The X.Blockchain we apply revolutionize the way documents are managed and information is stored. In
order to reach the agreement regarding the information contained in a new block, consensus is
necessary only with the relevant blocks but not all blocks leading to a significant reduction in the
capacity and speed required for data processing. The result is a grand innovation in the series of
processes related to the storage, reference, issuance, and movement of documents. Furthermore, this
can be very easily applied for commercial and consumer purposes.

The use of X.Blockchain is crucial in the document distribution infrastructure, and to accurately and
easily verify new information inputs, we have created the Smart-Pass-On solution, a biometric
signature authentication security technology based on PKI. This helps to expedite the authorization
process for digital documents.

Once the ASTON platform is completely developed, users can easily access ASTON through their
personal computers and mobile devices. Large enterprises will be able to access ASTON through their
ERP, groupware, or cloud systems to deliver and authenticate their documents. The ASTON platform
will also carefully connect to each of the nodes without synchronizing the data across the entire
blockchain.

The user who uses the Aston finally completed in its development based on the above components can
use all services of Aston by way of the smart device (smart phones, tablet PCs, smart watches and etc.)
owned by oneself and this will typically be the enterprise or the government agency which has the need
to render the service through the Aston platform. The enterprise or government agency will access
Aston through their system currently in use such as ERP, groupware, cloud and other systems to
provide/authenticate the documents as required. In this way, the credibility of the documents existing
within Aston can be established by the consensus of the nodes directly related to the corresponding
information.
2.2 What to expect from Aston

Market Overview

Survey data from reputable research firms suggest market demand for the ASTON platform will grow
rapidly in the coming years. According to the Electronic Access Control Systems Market report by

2.3 Current Projects & Achievement

ASTON development is in charge of Xblocksystems. XBC Technologies will maintain a close relationship
with Xblocksystems which has the state-of-the-art technology, and will ensure that ASTON
development and management are in order. Xblocksystems's blockchain technologies have already
been completed. (The Project history and Developer introduction listed below, Roadmap includes
Xblocksystems's work detailing the core contents of ASTON.)

2.3.1 Doorian

With its development completed in November 2016, the Doorian service automatically creates and
stores debt bonds in the blockchain network through the digital signature of electronic documents
when the funds are remitted between participants through the platform. This program was completed
in partnership with the FinTech Innovation Center at NH Nonghyup. The organization also provided us
with special access to its financial API called NH Open Platform. Doorian is the first mobile platform for
the authentication of documents in Korea utilizing blockchain technology, which provides users with a
high level of convenience and security. Soon, we will be able to expand the use of the Doorian’s
inderlying technology for broader commercial purposes.

2.3.2 Medical Certification Service

At large hospitals, more than one million sensitive medical documents are printed each month for
check-ups, hospital discharges, and medicine prescriptions. However, most people fail to properly
dispose of all these printed materials effectively, leaving the personal information inside vulnerable. In
a move to resolve this problem, we enabled hospitals to issue and confirm medical certificate
documents electronically. Hospitals ask patients to use their smartphones to fill out, share, and
retrieve their personal information and medical records. By distributing this information on our
blockchain platform instead of on hard copy documents, we minimize risks associated with the
storage, management, and transfer of sensitive personal and medical information.
Currently, we partner with more than 90 large hospitals in Korea that use our pilot medical certification
service. We also plan to commercialize the industry's first medical certification service later this year
allowing us to place our technology in more hospitals and other major medical institutions in Korea.

2.3.3. Mobile Smart Platform for Biometric Authentication

Xblocksystems's blockchain-based mobile security authentication service is being developed together
with LGU+, one of the top three mobile telecommunication companies in Korea. In the future, our plan
is to expand this solution to all domestic mobile telecommunication companies too. At the moment,
when users enroll in a new telecommunications service, they have to present a series of materials that
verify their identity and authenticate their enrollment. This cumbersome process happens each time
they subscribe to a new service. Once we roll out our blockchain-based mobile authentication service,
LGU+ users can sign up for all LGU+ services seamlessly after they have completed their initial
registration and authentication. Soon, users will be able to use our mobile smart platform for
documents beyond LGU+ instances, opening the door for broader application of this technology too.

2.3.4 Coinlink (Exchange of Cryptocurrency)

Coinlink is an ultra-secure global cryptocurrency exchange. When we introduced our beta 1.0 service
in September 2017, we saw a wide range of coins being traded on the exchange. We plan to launch our
global 2.0 service during the first quarter of 2018 and will add support for HTS and APP. Coinlink plans
to operate the business through subsidiary companies or alliance companies in different countries
around the world.

2.4 Near Future

Our current dependence on trusted third-party institutions to certify and validate documents creates
headaches for users. Of course, we at ASTON are eager to provide a permanent solution to that
problem. Document management, including preparation, issuance, submission, and delivery, will
become significantly easier once we have fully developed our platform for wide commercial use. Our
technology will streamline the document execution process too, saving users time since documents
are often delayed during the notarization process,

This type of innovation is made possible because of the decentralized ecosystem for document
circulation through X.Blockchain. This will also help individuals and enterprises save money because it
minimizes costs associated with data administration and security. Since these changes can be applied
to all service categories and industries such as medicine, telecommunications, legal, logistics, and
education, it won't be long before we can witness a future shaped by ASTON.

To bring ASTON to market and to develop its ecosystem, we need to focus on building infrastructure
such as a perfectly decentralized network and middlewares to connect all the gateways. Also, we will
develop decentralized applications (dApps) that can handle the full lifecycle of digital documents
hosted on ASTON. These functions include document creation, distribution, authorization, and so on.
We are developing infrastructure and dApps simultaneously to quickly bring our product to market. We
also anticipate standalone companies being built that will specialize in the development of dApps in the
ASTON ecosystem.

2.4.2 Infrastructure

1) Aston Gate (Aston Management Solution)

This is a software solution that collects information recorded in the DBs of institutions and enterprises
and stores it in ASTON. ASTON Gate will be compatible with Windows and Mac OS platforms and will be
designed to allow easy use in the cloud. Companies will be able to use ASTON Gate to capture, manage,
and review the data it receives. The solution is malleable, and can be customized to accommodate
thepecific needs of our customers in different industries and categories.

2) Aston Factory (Blockchain AP! host service)

This serves as the API access tool to enable users such as enterprises and government agencies to
mutually share documents and to access important information. Our solution aims to establish a
one-stop service that manages everything from verification of information to billing. As big data has
exploded, the API industry has also experienced rapid growth. However, due to their security
vulnerabilities, APIs are seldom used. ASTON Factory is the premier verification and billing tool to
overcome the restrictions and risks prevalent among APIs today. ASTON Factory allows businesses to
securely handle sensitive personal information from its users.

3) Aston ITP (International Trade Protocol)

At ASTON, we will develop our own standard protocols to ensure documents in our system are
received, processed, and executed in a consistent manner, especially internationally. Although the
language for monetary transfers is meant to be standardized, we still see a wide variety of terms used
between financial institutions and platforms. This inconsistency can complicate and delay the funds
transfer process. The goal of ASTON ITP is to be able to securely handle digital documents and provide
users with a seamless experience. With ASTON ITP, we can easily imagine a borderless world where
your local, neighborhood shoemaker can export his goods to overseas to customers in Argentina,
Cambodia, and even South Africa.
Why Aston

3.1 X.Blockchain

The size of blockchains in which the details of all transactions are recorded is bound to grow as the
cumulative number of transactions grows. In other words, as time passes, the network will expand to a
point when it becomes impossible for all participants in the network to store and manage all the existing
blockchains. That is, the systems (nodes) with the capacity capable of the storage and administration of
the whole blockchains will progressively diminish in their number. As a result, there is a high possibility
that a relatively small group of oversize nodes will form over time. This leads to centralization. In this
case, whole blockchains are managed by a relatively small group of nodes; consequently, the credibility
of transactions in those blockchains are reliant on that centralized group of nodes. This compromises
the fundamental concept of blockchains: decentralization.

[Format of a Blockchain with 2 dimensions]

a D
In reflection of the characteristics of the electronic documents mentioned previously, the X.Blockchain
categorizes the records (transactions) related to a document based on the ‘document’ or the other
equivalent criteria rather than linking them in a single linear structure. And by implementing multiple
chains based on the same criteria, the multidimensional blockchain is conceived. For example, when the
document is used as the criteria, the ‘first creation’ of each document is recorded in the blockchain
(main-chain) of the same linear structure as the existing blockchains. However, the additional records
(transactions) which occurred to the specific documents recorded already in the main-chain such as the
modifications are recorded in the sub-chains which are the other blockchains created on the basis of the
related block in the main-chain as a genesis block rather than in the main-chain.

The full nodes responsible for mining the new blocks in the X.Blockchain still collect information about all
blocks. However, when clients just want to evaluate the validity of a document rather than the mining of
it, they shouldn't have to observe the whole block. Each user can verify the credibility of the target
document to a sufficient level by only acquiring the sub-chain containing the document that requires
verification and the main-chain at the next higher level without the need of a trusted third-party
institution. Here, the full nodes only undertake the role for mining rather than as the trusted third-party
institution to confirm the credibility of the documents. (For details, please refer to the X-chain white
paper posted in the homepage. https://aston.company) ASTON currently holds 2 domestic patents on
X.Blockchain, and the PCT international patent is pending.

3.2 Smart-Pass-On

The Smart-Pass-On feature is a solution aimed to provide an easy and convenient security
authentication solution. Our target customer is FinTech businesses. The Smart-Pass-On is implemented
using PKI private authentication, biometric signature authentication (FIDO), and blockchains. When the
Smart-Pass-On solution is utilized, the diverse solutions for authentication, identification, security, and
data administration are consolidated. Enterprise users will no longer have to implement each solution
individually and, instead, can access all of the Smart-Pass-On features in a bundled package for a
readymade out of the box solution.

Major Features

1. Biometric Signature Authentication (FIDO)

The API is provided to enable the implementation of an identity authentication service by utilizing the
biometric information unique to individuals such as the fingerprint, iris, face, voice, and more for identity
confirmation.

2. Identity Verification for Registration/Identity Authentication after Registration The API is provided
which is necessary for electronic authentication by utilizing the private certificates and the
authentication institutions based on the public key infrastructure for the identity verification of
individuals for registration necessary when they use the service for the first time, and the identity
authentication of individuals after registration

3. Operation and Administration of Electronic Documents

All of the APIs provided are needed for the operation and administration of the electronic documents
and the interface to corroborate the format of the electronic documents. These facilitate encryption,
data compression, and more for rendering documents that require digital security and authentication.
4. Blockchain System

Our system converts existing blockchain technology to formulate a new paradigm for the storage of
information electronically.

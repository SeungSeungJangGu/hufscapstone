Introduction

Ethereum [1] has advanced Bitcoin [2] through smart contract to make digital assets
being directly controlled by a piece of code, which creates possibility for more complex
applications [3]. Yet, current smart contract has no privacy. The input data to the smart
contract, and the execution result is public visible to the whole network, which limits
the usage and adoption by many real-world privacy-concerned companies and indi-
viduals [4]. While blockchain's powerful technologies have allowed untrusted parties
to interact with each other securely and correctly, Origo strengthens that in addition to
security and correctness, privacy is the key towards a broader adoption of blockchain.
Although progresses like Zerocash [5] have enabled private transaction, Origo furthers
such privacy work based on related research such as Hawk [6], Bulletproofs [7] etc. by
enabling parties to create and execute smart contract without revealing private input
and output.

1.1. Privacy Problems

Real world governments and centralized private corporations are increasing om-
nipresent surveillance on their citizens and users. Soon or later there will be a moment
when citizens and users start demanding their fundamental human rights to privacy.
With the growing global concern about privacy, public media has repeatedly covered
controversial privacy related incidents. One examples is the story about government
surveillance [8], and another example is Facebook's large-scale scientific experiment
that was apparently conducted without explicitly informing participants [9].
Introduction 2

Business and individuals have concerns when all of their privacy is viewed with-
out restrictions on public blockchain, as such exposure might cause issues such as
intellectual property ownership and rights, data misuse, inimical behaviors etc.

In terms of contracts, many entities have major concerns on sensitive data/details,
such as contract monetary amount, key data of performance/measurement, and
contract execution prerequisites. Traditional smart contracts like Ethereum failed to
protect these sensitive contract details, hence restricting industrial and personal usage.

1.2. Contributions

¢ Privacy Preserving Application Platform: By combining an innovative privacy
protocol with an efficient zero knowledge proof(ZKP) framework, Origo's Privacy
Preserving Application Platform(PPAP) guards the input/output data privacy
and transaction privacy for decentralized applications.

¢ Off-chain Computation: Origo supports off-chain execution of decentralized
applications, which not only protects the privacy of application execution, but
also significantly improves the on-chain performance.

Future Work: multiple interesting future work could be introduced in later ver-
sions: support of cross chain for privacy preserving applications, zero knowledge
proof framework without trusted setup, formal verification tools for decentralized
applications, adopting a high scalable architecture, which is achieved by imple-
menting numerous promising technologies focusing on improving performance:
enhanced consensus protocol, state-of-the-art sharding, stateless client, improved
application runtime environment(Virtual Machine), and more.

Overview

2.1. Scope of Aimed Privacy

While recent projects like Monero [10], ZCash, etc. have strived to solve privacy
issues by creating new private cryptocurrencies. Yet, these projects aim to achieve
confidential transactions mainly through mechanisms of Zero-Knowledge Proofs
and other cryptography primitives. Origo aims to provide more privacy preserving
ability: not only confidential transactions, but also input/output data privacy for
decentralized applications written in smart contracts. Therefore Origo's results much
more complexity than those projects mentioned above. Here is a comparison of scope
of aimed privacy between Origo and those confidential transaction focused projects.

As it is shown in Table 2.1, if one illustrates Monero/ZCash/MimbleWimble as
a fork of Bitcoin that support confidential transactions, then Origo is more aligned
with an enhanced Ethereum-liked decentralized application platform which guards
input/output data privacy of applications.

Origo Protocol

3.1. Design Principles

Privacy-preserving application platform provides more functionality than confidential
transaction. Confidential transaction means to protect the sender and receiver along
with the amount of money. Privacy preserving applications require more than that,
including the functionality of confidential transaction, and also the ability of protecting
input/output data privacy.

Parties provide their input data (e.g., choices in a gamble game) and the currency
units (e.g., bids in an auction) to the system. After receiving all the inputs, the
system executes the application in off-chain, and then it encrypted outputs the payout
distribution amongst the parties. The system needs to ensure the privacy of the inputs
and the fairness of the execution:

¢ Privacy of the inputs/outputs: The inputs and outputs of applications(including
data and amount of currencies) should be protected against public. In other
words, the inputs/outputs are cryptographically hidden from the public. To
achieve this, all the information sent to/from blockchain is encrypted and uses
zero knowledge proofs to ensure the correctness of contract execution.

Fairness of the execution: for decentralized applications, especially when there
are multi-party involved, only protecting the privacy against public is not enough.
Assuming the participants are selfish to maximize their own interest, they may
abort before the execution. The system also need to ensure the fairness among
the parties.
Origo Protocol 5

Origo proposes a solution to execute decentralized application securely and pri-
vately. To protect input/output data privacy, Origo execute decentralized applications
in an off-chain environment. A proof of off-chain execution should be submitted to
on-chain for verification of correct computation.

Application developers do not need to have knowledge about cryptography. At
Origo privacy-preserving application platform (PPAP), they can write application in
the original way and Origo PPAP compiles and executes application without leaking its
input and output. PPAP empowers developers to build privacy-protecting applications
easily and conveniently.

To ensure efficiency and privacy, Origo has provided both on-chain and off-chain
computation stages. The execution and proof of correctness for application requires
privacy is done off-chain; the verification of computation for privacy preserving appli-
cation and execution of normal application is done on-chain. We use zero knowledge
proof to ensure that the public blockchain can verify the correctness of off-chain ap-
plication execution, while maintaining execution details private. Origo also proposes
proper economic mechanism to prevent malicious party aborting the contract.

3.2. Limitations of Current Solution

There's no simple way to implement Turing complete, privacy preserving application
using existing blockchain technology.

Ethereum is a public permissionless blockchain that supports Turing complete
applications. It does not provide any transaction privacy. Each node need run the
contract to verify contracts are executed correctly. So the input, intermediate status
and output of a contract is available to every node in Ethereum.

There are some techniques that could preserve some privacy for certain applications
in Ethereum. For example, when two parties are playing rock-paper-scissors games
using Ethereum smart contract, if one party directly post its choice to the contact,
the other party could take advantage of this by reading the first party's choice and
post an adversary one. Instead, they could first post the hash of their choice plus
a random string to the contract, and after both parties have committed their input,
then they could reveal their input by submit their choice of random string to the
contract. Then the contract can get input from each parties by checking if the hash of
Origo Protocol 6

their claimed input plus random string matches their submitted hash value. Code 3.1
demonstrates the described solution. Such techniques allows two parties to play this
game, without worrying about one party could see another party's choice and adjust
his choice accordingly. However, the outcome of this game is still public. Everyone
could know who won the game and how much is paid to the winner.

def commit(party, choice, random_string) :

commitment = HASH FUNC(choice, random_string)
party .send (commitment)

5 def reveal(party, choice, random_string):

WAIT_UNTIL(len (commitments) == 2, TIMEOUT(T) )
expected_commitment = HASH FUNC(choice, random_string)
received_commitment = commitments|[ party ]
if expected_commitment == received_commitment:

return (party, choice)
return (party , NULL_CHOICE)

def execute(parties , party_choices):
if winner(party_choices) == parties [0]:
transfer_all_fund_to(parties[0])
elif winner(party_choices) == parties[1]:
transfer_all_fund_to(parties[1])
else:
refund_all_parties (parties )

Listing 3.1: Pseudocode of smart contract on Ethereum to play rock-paper-scissors game

Cryptocurrencies like Zcash or Monero partially solved this problem by supporting
confidential transactions. However they do not support smart contract. Origo will
support confidential transaction and smart contract for decentralized applications.
And to prevent the input/out data of those privacy preserving applications becoming
public, they will be executed off chain. But the execution could still be verified without
revealing the actual result using zero knowledge proof. And proper protocol has been
designed to incentivize each party to behave by the rules.

3.3. Protocol Overview

To address above limitations, Origo supports private transaction and smart contract.
Inspired by the work from Hawk [6], we introduce a protocol combining on-chain and
off-chain computation, which preserves the privacy of smart contract when executing.

As shown in Figure 3.1, there are four phases in our protocol: Initialize, Commit,
Execute and Settle. Here's a brief explanation of the four phases. Most of the details
are described in next chapter.

In Initialize phase, an executor from the network will be elected for later execution
phase.

In Commit phase, each party will freeze their coins to the contract, and they
will submit a commitment including their private input and coin. By using the
commitment schema, the input and coin will be private, but the party can't change it
after commitment. After all parties have submitted the commitment or the timeout of
this phrase has reached, and the deposit has been verified. It moves to next phase.

In the Execution phase, each party will reveal their private input to an offline
executor. Executor will execute smart contract offline, in this way the input and
execution result will not be revealed to public.
Origo Protocol 8

After contract is executed. Executor will generate a zero knowledge proof that the
contract is executed correctly. Once the blockchain verifies the correctness, the fund
will be distributed to each party based on execution result.

By using this protocol, user input, transaction amount and contract execution
details are kept private. But everyone could still verify whether contract is correctly
executed.
Chapter 4.
Technical Design

4.1. Protocol Roles

Origo protocol contains three major roles involved in the full life cycle of smart contract

execution:

¢ Parties: P,,--- ,Py,aset of users participating the Smart Contract SC. Parties of-

fer private input pe, tee, re public input pe, tee, ree and coins C,,--- ,Cy.

¢ Blockchain:B, an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between
parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way.

¢ Executor:PE, a special party facilitates the execution of Origo's smart contract.
Executor outputs the result O,,--- ,Oj for each party.

4.2. Protocol Phases

The Origo protocol has four phases: Initialize, Commit, Execute, Settle, These four
phases are strictly bounded by two timeouts:T, and T5, while Tyginmjzp < Ty and Ty < Toxecute < T2.
Here are the technical details of each phase.

4.2.1. Initialize Phase

Parties elects a node N; in Blockchain B as executor Pr, Pr's public key Kp is shared to
all parties.
Technical Design 10

4.2.2. Commit Phase

Each Party P, (i € [N]) freeze the coin C; (i € [N]) they want to deposit into the
smart contract from its wallet. Each party will compute a commitment cm = comm(C;||I? "ey
,and zero knowledge proof Proofc, (i € [N]) of its frozen coin C;. The commitment

cm and Proo fc, is supposed to be sent to blockchain B before T;, otherwise parties will

not be accepted as contract's participants.

Blockchain B is responsible for verifying Proo fc, sent by each party, and guarantee
no new parties is accepted after T,. If all the required parties have committed their
input and coins, the contract will move to Execute phase. Otherwise the contract will
be aborted and all the committed coins will be refunded to each party.

The purpose of this phase is to let each party submit their input and coins privately.
No one (even the executor) could know other parties'input or coin at this phase. Their
input and coins deposit to smart contract are immutable after this phase. No one could
take advantage by changing his own input or coin after knowing other parties'input.

4.2.3. Execute Phase

Each Party P; (i € [N]) encrypts its private input re (i[N]) and coins C; (i € [N]) in-
formation with executor Pp's public key Ke. And a zero knowledge proof Proof, (i € [N])
is built to prove that the encrypted value matches his commitment cm. The encrypted
data ENC(I? "| |C;) and corresponding proof Proof, will be send to blockchain.

Once blockchain receives the encrypted data and proof from each party. B will
verify that for each party, the encrypted data ENC(I? eal |C;) matches the commitment
em = comm(C;||IP ry submitted in commit phase. This prevents any party alert their
input data after other parties submitted their encrypted data. After B successfully
verified Proof, and checked current time T; < T < Ty, it sends the encrypted data to
executor Pr.

After receiving the verified encrypted data from blockchain B, executor Pp decrypts

priv
i

it with his private key PK, to get I; ) and C; for each party, and executes the smart

contract.

Before T,, if any parties failed to send the encrypted data and proof to blockchain,
or if the proof is not correct, that party will be considered as aborting the contract.
Technical Design 11

Proper punishment could be applied to his deposit based on the requirement of the
contract.

If the executor failed to send the output and proof to the blockchain before timeout,
executor will be considered as aborting. Since a malicious executor could on purpose
abort the contract if the execution result is not in certain party's favor. To prevent this,
we could require executor to pay certain amount of deposits. When executor failed to
submit the result or proof, he will lose his deposit.

To make sure executor will not disclose each party's input or outcome after execu-
tion, it is a good idea to run execution on trusted hardware like Intel SGX [11].

4.2.4. Settle Phase

Once executor Pr finished its execution, outputs O1,--- ,Ox for each party P; (i € [N])
is produced. Pr builds proof Proof, to prove the outputs are correctly compute from
parties'inputs and the smart contract, and encrypt the outputs O,,--- ,O,, with each
party's public key KP; (i € [N]) as ENC(O,),--- ,ENC(Oy). Then Pz sends Proof;
and ENC(O,),--- , ENC(Oy) to blockchain B,

B verifies Proof; to check the contract is executed correctly, and distributes the
coins to each party based on execution result.

Lastly, each party decrypts the output. If he gets any coin from the contract, he
could deposit it to his wallet using private transaction.

4.3. Zero Knowledge Proof

Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is key technique for Origo to ensure the privacy of the
smart contract while executing the contract correctly and completely. ZKP is a well
established method in cryptography. In ZKP, there two parties, one party, called prover
can prove to another party, called verifier, some statements holds without sharing any
information about why it holds. ZKP protocol must satisfy the following properties:

¢ Completeness: given honest prover and honest verifier, the protocol succeeds
with overwhelming probability.
Technical Design 12

e¢ Soundness: no one who does not know the secret can convince the verifier with
the non-negligible probability.

¢ Zero Knowledge: the proof does not leak any additional information.

The very intuitive way to create a ZKP protocol is to allow the interactive communi-
cation between prover and verifier, called Interactive Zero Knowledge Proof, IZKP.
Verifier can construct any question (even randomly) for prover based on the assump-
tion that prover knows the secret information and prover can answer that question
only if possessing announced secret information, of course constructing questions
based the previous replies from the prover is also allowed.

It is possible to convert any IZKP (if the verifier is a public coin verifier, ie. the
random choices made by the verifier are made public) into a non-interactive protocol
that is secure and zero-knowledge in the random oracle model using the Fiat-Shamir
heuristic [12] — All random challenges are replaced by hashes. More specifically,
Non-Interactive Zero Knowledge Proofs (NIZK) have been proposed as the tool to
enable smart contracts which do not expose the user inputs in academia [6, 13,14]. But
NIZK has its own limitation for the practical usage of smart contracts. Due to the fact
the communication over the blockchain equipped with smart contract is expensive
and the smart contract's own computation ability is very limited. Even the current
widely adopted SNARKs [15], which is a neutral choice for smart contracts require a
complex trusted setup. The core of the trusted setup, common reference strings (CRS)
are usually long and specific to each individual smart contract and makes the schema
unreliable because of the possible trapdoors.

Arithmetic circuit (AC), as the core of every digital circuit, can be used to form
any mathematical representation. It is a combination of small logic operations, like
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. For example, Figure 4.1 shows the
AC format for computation (a+ b) x c/d.

Based on the fact that (a) any computational condition can be represented by
AC, which takes some input and output a boolean value, true or false; (b) smart
contract, which is turing complete in a formally specified language, can be viewed as
a complicated collection and interaction of computational conditions. So, transferring
smart contract to arithmetic circuit is not a surprise. Different techniques has been
proposed [7, 16] to create efficient zero-knowledge argument for arbitrary arithmetic
circuit (AC), ie. prover can prove the possession of certain input to satisfy the AC, or
Technical Design 13

output

Figure 4.1.: Example of arithmetic circuit

say making the AC output true. So proving the correctness of the contract execution
without sharing contract data/information becomes possible.

4.3.1. ZKP In Origo

In Orgio, ZKP is used to shield transaction information(send/receiver address, trans-
action amount) and input/output of smart contract. Based on section 3.3, when
executing a private smart contract, multiple phases require ZKP to prove and verify
commitment from both parties P; (i € [N]) and executor P,:

¢ Commit Phase: parties P; (i € [N]) need to prove they have put sufficient coins
C; (i € [N}) into the smart contract SC:

- statement := NIZK.Prove(P,, (C;||K;), witness) (i € [N])
- NIZK.Verify(P,, statement)

* Compute Phase: parties P; (i € [N]) need to prove their private inputs I?” (i € [N])
of smart contract SC are correctly encrypted with executor's public key Kp:

= 1?" :— ENC(I;, Kp) (i[N])(Off-chain)
- statement := NIZK.Prove(P;, re, witness) (i € [N])
- NIZK.Verify(P,, statement)

¢ Settle Phase: executor P; needs to prove it successfully executed smart contract
SC with correct output O; (i € [N]):

— statement := NIZK.Prove(P,, Oj, witness) (i € [N])
Technical Design 14

Proof System | zk-SNARKs zk-STARKs Bulletproofs

Verifier Time Efficient Efficient Linear
Trusted Setup | Required Not Required Not Required
Practical Yes No Yes

Table 4.1.: Comparison of different ZKP systems

- statement := NIZK.Prove(P;, re, witness) (i € [N])

All proving processes in Origo described above are proceeded off-chain, which could
possibility take a few seconds to minutes for being finished. While for verifying,
different NIZK systems show variant performance while verifying on-chain. The
variance of verifying performance is traded off between requirement of setup process
and proof/Vverification size.

4.3.2. Trusted Setup

As we described above, most of the current techniques requires a trusted setup step
for each application, then either a trusted third party or multi-party computation
(MPC) has to be used. However, since Origo is designed to support privacy preserving
smart contract, so each smart contract needs a trusted setup for creating unique CRS.
No matter which trusted setup process we could take, it makes creating a privacy
preserving smart contract very heavy and inflexible. Therefore, for privacy preserving
smart contract, no trusted setup is essential for making Origo practical. Note that, for
private transaction, we could tolerate trusted setup, because it only need to be done
once, and industry already had showcases for running a valid setup ceremony.

We investigated several new techniques [7,15] provide a valid ZKP protocol without
trusted setup, as illustrated in Table 4.1, currently practical proof system without
trusted setup has worse verifier efficiency. More expensive verifier could further
degrade consensus speed, if verification is required to be done on chain. To work
around this, off-chain verification is necessary to minimize the drawbacks caused by
new proof system without trusted setup.
Technical Design 15

Features Secure Multi-Party Computation Origo
Performance Poor Acceptable
Privacy of Output No Yes
Synchronization Required Not Required

Table 4.2.: Comparison of Secure Multi-Party Computation and Origo

4.3.3. Comparison with Secure Multi-Party Computation

Besides ZKP, we also researched several other privacy preserving technologies such
as homomorphic encryption and secure multi-party computation. Secure multi-party
computation allow parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keep-
ing those inputs private. When applied to smart contract, it also allows participating
parties to jointly compute the out of smart contract execution, and keep their input

data private.

However, MPC requires multiple rounds of interactions between parties, but non-
interactive zero knowledge proof does not require this between proofer and verifier.
Also, there's no existing approach for execution results to be privately preserved by all
participating parties. Most importantly, the computation complexity of MPC is much
higher than ZKP, and it could only be applied to limited scope in real applications.
Therefore, we think ZKP is a better solution to build privacy preserving application
platform.

4.3.4. Conclusion

To ensure the efficiency of private transaction, we prefer to apply ZKP that require
trusted setup for private transaction verification. Because it has more efficient veri-
fication time and the verification could be done on blockchain. And requiring each
privacy preserving smart contract to perform its own trusted setup is not practical.
Therefore we prefer to apply ZKP techniques that does not require trusted set up to

verify contract execution.
Chapter 5.

Infrastructure

5.1. Ethereum Compatibility

As our current status, Origo's chain infrastructure is Ethereum compatible: PoW
consensus, EVM, Solidity. Initially we developed our platform based on Ethereum's
byzantium fork. The reasons that chooses Ethereum compatible infrastructure as
the first step are: Ethereum community has the largest groups of active developers;
We could invest more resources on our privacy technologies to make them optimal.
The block gas limit of our current platform is designed to be higher than what cur-
rent Ethereum has, because privacy preserving features require more computation
resources. However, Ethereum compatible infrastructure has several scalability chal-
lenges, we are willing to overcome these challenges in the later versions of Origo
platform.

5.2. Confidential Transaction

The goal of confidential transaction is to ensure that the data in the transaction remains
private. Similar to Zcash, confidential transaction uses private addresses. The transac-
tion between two private addresses will not leak any information about the sender,
receiver or transaction amount to the third party. User could also transfer token from
public address to private address, and vice versa. We utilize zero knowledge proof
system zkSNARKs to keep the transaction data private. And the correctness of the
confidential transaction(such as sender knows the secrete to spend the token from the

16
Infrastructure 17

private address, and the sum of input token equals the sum of output token), could
still be verified by the public.
Chapter 6.

Future Improvements

Ethereum-like infrastructure suffers several limitations on scalability to make the
platform to be extremely efficient. Therefore, our future improvements on the platform
will be mostly focus on implementing more scalability features:

¢ Optimized Consensus - a hybrid consensus to improve the throughput of trans-
actions.

¢ Sharding - a state-of-the-art sharding protocol to make Origo linearly scalable.

e Enhanced Virtual Machine - a new virtual machine standard to improve the
execution speed of smart contract.

In this whitepaper, below sections introduce these techniques briefly. Once we
have more concrete design on each of these potential techniques, we will publish more
detailed documents.

6.1. Consensus Protocol

Consensus specifies how a group of nodes in network reach agreements on a value.
Consensus protocol should be resilient to failures of nodes, network partitioning,
out-of-order/corrupted messages or message delays. Selfish node or deliberately
malicious node could also breaks the consensus or leads to wrong state. There are
two key properties in consensus: i) non-faulty nodes should produce output even-
tually(liveness); ii) all nodes participating in the consensus produces identical and
valid output(consistency). Consensus is not a new problem: the academic world has

been studying it extensively for several decades, and developed numerous practical
solutions which could tolerate malicious nodes [17,18]. However, these solutions are
aimed for closed, permissioned, low latency network.

Bitcoin's fundamental innovation was to enable consensus on open, permissionless
and decentralized network. It was achieved by a leader election procedure called
Proof-of-Work(PoW): all participants attempt to solve a mathematical puzzle and the
participant who wins has the right add next block. PoW has very strong guarantee
of security on permissionless network, however it suffers from poor performance
without fundamental redesign [19] and it consumes a huge amount of energy. With
the rapid growth of blockchain industry, numerous proposals have been made to
address above issues [20]. Some researches focused on reduce the energy consump-
tion(e,g. Proof-of-Stake, PoS [21]), while others focused on modify the original PoW
protocol to have better performance [22]. Compared to classical consensus protocol on
permissioned network, performance of these protocols are still not quite ideal when
adopting blockchain into real world applications. Table 6.1 illustrates between classical
consensuses and blockchain focused consensuses.

Given the fact that both classical consensus and blockchain focused consensus are
not quite ideal for massive adoption in current blockchain environment. We believe a
hybrid consensus protocol, which is able to achieve similar performance like classical
consensus, and it does not require permissioned settings, should be considered to be
a long term consensus engine for our platform. Figure 6.1 demonstrates the future
possible architecture of Origo Consensus:

¢ To address the requirement of node awareness in pBFT consensus, we need
an identity chain. The identity chain uses current widely adopted blockchain
focused consensus like PoW or PoS, or any other consensus that is resilient to

sybil attack [23]. The identity chain is a chain of Identity Block, each block contains
a list of nodes which are eligible for being transaction chain validators.

¢ pBFT should be adopted as the consensus of transaction chain. Due to pBFT
has best performance in relatively small network(e.g. a few hundreds of nodes),
therefore a periodical validator election is implemented, a fixed but configurable
number validators are randomly elected from nodes recorded in identity chain to
perform pBFT consensus.

e¢ A random beacon based on BLS signature [24] has to be implemented as a secure
source of distributed randomness. The randomness is required for electing
validators from candidates, and also sharding the network.

We will have more design and implementation details about Origo's hybrid con-
sensus in future documents.

6.2. Sharding

In most current blockchain designs, each node stores all on-chain data, processing
all transactions. Though this mechanism largely protects the security, however it
sacrafices performance a lot. Blockchains like Ethereum or Bitcoin could only process
less than tens of transactions per second. To address these issues, We concluded there
are two types of sharding mechanism: computation sharding and state sharding.
Future Improvements 21

6.2.1. Computation Sharding

Computation sharding indicates nodes are split into multiple groups, each group
processes a subset of transactions. Therefore the network is linearly scalable with the
increasing number of groups. However a secure deterministic random generator is
essential for grantee security. Without a secure and deterministic random generator,
the shard assignment will be deductible. A deductible shard assignment would greatly
decrease security, the difficulty of attacking a single shard is much less than attacking
the entire network. As we mentioned in 6.1, we need a BLS signature [24] to generate
random number with group of pre-elected validators. The shard assignment will
be recorded into Identity Block, and client uses this information send transaction to
corresponding shards. Using sender address of a transaction as the sharding criteria,
would guarantee all transactions from same account will be processed in same shard,

which minimize the cross shard communication requirement.

6.2.2. State Sharding

To further improve scalability, State sharding should be also adopted. State sharding
indicates nodes are sharded to store partial block data. Compared to computation
sharding, state sharding has much more challenging issues: i) it needs to extensive
work to make it secure ii) cross shard communication is necessary and often, because
it’s very likely a transaction needs to involve state cross multiple shards, but cross
shard communication would hurt the overall throughput.

6.3. Virtual Machine

Virtual Machine is the runtime environment for smart contract, which is one of the
most crucial part of blockchain to support smart contract. Future Origo VM should
be based on an emerging virtual machine standard: WebAssembly (or WASM for
short), a new, portable, size- and load-time-efficient format. WebAssembly is currently
being designed as an open standard by a W3C Community Group. WASM is not
only efficient and performant, but also contains support from LLVM as compilation
backend, which could support multiple programing languages as input. In the long
Future Improvements 22

term, Future Origo VM will support more developer friendly language like Python or
Java. Figure 6.2 illustrates the process of compiling and executing a smart contract.

Figure 6.2.: Ethereum's Compile and execute process of smart contract

Origo's privacy preserving smart contract, which relies on Zero Knowledge Proof(ZKP)
to proof and verify privacy preserving smart contract execution, requires compiler and
VM integrated with ZKP systems. A privacy preserving smart contract needs to be
compiled into arithmetic circuits as provable program in ZKP system. The VM should
be able to run the circuits to produce proofs and verify proofs. Because Origo supports
both public and privacy preserving smart contract, an Origo VM instance is designed
to be able to run both public and privacy preserving smart contract. Therefore the
above normal pipeline of compiling and executing smart contract would not be able
to meet our requirement. In the long term, a pipeline which accepts both public and
privacy preserving smart contract is necessary. illustrated as Figure 6.3.

Currently, Origo's Virtual Machine is EVM compatible with extended opcode
to support ZKP prove and verify operation with circuits. Moreover, Origo's privacy
preserving smart contract language is a limited Solidity with strict on certain operations
to achieve better performance. Note that Origo public smart contract is complete
Solidity. We intend to use Solidity as Origo DSL because of minimum effort is required
for migrating smart contract from Ethereum to Origo.

Applications

7.1. Applications Enabled by Origo

Origo' Privacy Preserving Protocol enables broad adoption of decentralized applica-
tions that requires privacy. As mentioned in section 2.1, we classify them into two

categories:

7.1.1. Privacy against Public

In this category participants want to keep input and output private from public, but
they are fine to share these information between participants. Here are some examples

of applications at each domain:
Finance:

¢ Private exchange

¢ Credit scoring

¢ Online lending

¢ Insurance

¢ Options and futures contracts
Enterprise:

¢ Salary/bonus contracts

24
Applications 25

¢ Employee stock incentive plans
¢ Supply chain contracts
¢ Corporate compliance
Health Care:
¢ Personalized medicine
¢ Diagnostics
¢ Medical records
Others:
¢ IoT

For applications in this category such as payroll, employee and employer involved
just want to keep the salary private from public. In this case, either employer or
employee can execute the contract locally and submit a zero knowledge proof to
blockchain. So the Origo protocol could be optimized to improve the efficiency for
these application.

7.1.2. Privacy against Participant Party

In this category, each participant want to keep his input, output and transaction
amount private from everyone else. So the full origo protocol will be applied to satisfy
the privacy requirement. Examples of such applications include:

¢ Fundraising(e.g. token fundraising)
e Auction

¢ Voting

7.2. Privacy Preserving Application Platform(PPAP)

With Origo PPAP, developers can build Privacy-Preserving applications without
knowledge of cryptography, since Origo PPAP provides a compiler which auto-
Applications 26

matically generates cryptographic protocols, using cryptographic primitives such
as Zero-Knowledge Proofs.

7.3. Example

We present the pseudocode for the payroll that uses Origo application platform:

# Employer offchain
2 def commit(rate, coin):
cm = commitment(rate, coin. value)
4 proof = ZKP.prove(coin is valid)
5 # interact with blockchain
BlockChain._commit(proof, coin, cm)
s def execute(rate, coin):
encrypted_input = encrypt(executor.epk, [rate, coin. value ])
0 proof = ZKP.prove(encrypted_input correctly encrypted)
1 # interact with blockchain
12 BlockChain. _execute(proof, encrypted_input)

13
u #BlockChain

5 def _commit(proof, coin, cm):

«  ZKP.verify(proof, coin is valid)

vv check(not_spend (coin) )

18 freeze_coin_to_contract (coin)

19

2» def _execute(proof, encrypted_input):

ZKP. verify (proof, encrypted_input correctly encrypted)
#send encrypted_input to executor.

call Executor. execute (encrypted_input)

o» def _settle(output, [coin_employee, coin_employer], proofs):

ZKP.verify(proofs, contract is correctly executed and [coin_employee,
coin_employer] are valid)

2  _send(coin_employee, employee)
28

30

Applications 27

freeze_coin_to_contract(coin_employer) # for later use

# Executor offchain
def execute(encrypted_input) :
rate, coin_value = decrypt(encrypted_input)
salary = rate » hour
balance = coin_value — salary
output = encrypt({balance}, employer. enc_key)
if balance > 0:
coin_employee = coin(salary)
coin_employer = coin(balance)
else:

handle_error("not enough balance")
coin_employee = coin(coin_value)

coin_employer = coin(0)

proofs = [ZKP.prove(contract is correctly executed), ZKP. prove ([
coin_employee, coin_employer] are valid) ]

# interact with blockchain

BlockChain. _settle(output, [coin_employee, coin_employer], proofs)

Listing 7.1: Pseudocode of smart contract on Origo to execute a payroll

The employer offchain part is auto generated, and the code on the blockchain part
is built in by Origo. Developers just need to implement the logic within the executor
part. It would be very similar as writing a smart contract in Ethereum.
Chapter 8.
Security

8.1. Fairness Assurance

To ensure the fairness of the execution of smart contract, inputs and execution are
separated into two steps. All contract's participants must prepare and commit their
encrypted inputs (including money) before starting execution. Since all of these
commits are encrypted, if they do not want to disclose to other parties, all inputs will
be hidden from each other. When the commit step ends, none of the parties can change
the input anymore. After commit step finishes, parties need to open their inputs to the
executor so that the executor can process the smart contract. In this step, even arbitrary
parties know others'inputs, because all inputs are immutable after the commit, they
can not change the inputs anymore. By this design, none of the parties can affect the
result of the execution.

8.2. Execution Completeness - Party

Since the design ensure the fairness among all the participants, none of them can
change the execution result, the only thing they can do is to abort to prevent loss
if arbitrary parties know others' inputs and predict the result (e.g., gamble game).
Deposit mechanism is introduced to prevent this. For contracts need to prevent
quitting (e.g., gamble game), Origo provides a deposit framework for contract designer,
which allows all parties make deposit before participating. Therefore, if any parties
abort the contract, all their deposit will be shared by other participants. In this way,
the parties won't have the motivation to abort the contract.

28
Security 29

8.3. Execution Completeness - Executor

Unlike parties' abortion, deposit is not enough for executor. By default, the executor
will also make deposit to execute the contract. Once it fails, the deposit will be
distributed among all participants. For contracts with high availability requirement,
backup executor mechanism is designed. There will be another executor/group runs
the same contract and serve as verifiers. Normally, it will only check the result of the
main executor, if the executor abort, it will be the backup.
Chapter 9.

Cryptoeconomics Design

9.1. Design Principles

Former decentralized systems like torrent platform have failed due to lack of economic
incentives for users to follow rules, such as keeping seeds to share the file with
the network for others to download in torrent's case. Bitcoin has improved these
decentralized systems by establishing a proper crytoeconomic mechanism for users to
not only follow the rules, but also overcome Byzantine General's Problem to create a
perfect consensus system.

On Origo platform, rules (shown later in this chapter) mainly focus on issues with
privacy that, for instance, each role of Origo DOES NOT conduct any intended or
unintended behaviors related to smart contract privacy such as info leak and privacy
preserving contract execution abort. In order to reach consensus based on rules of
Origo, incentive mechanism alone would be insufficient as consensus algorithms like
POW and POS could cause “double spending” or “nothing at stake” problems, due
to a lack of punishment (negative incentive) mechanism. Therefore, Origo applies
a hybrid consensus algorithm combine BFT consensus with stake based blockchain

consensus.

9.2. Incentives and Roles

First of all, Origo Consensus consist of two incentive sets described in Table 9.1.

30
Cryptoeconomics Design 31

Incentive Set #1 - Basic Set

Origo Token Origo Token serves a similar “gas fee” function as ETH
on Ethereum. Roles who actively participate and con-
tribute to the blockchain get assigned cryptocurrencies
for their efforts.

Privileges Roles can use Origo Token for various purposes within
Origo ecosystem.

Incentive Set #2 - Advanced Set

Deposits Origo Token required as deposits to perform certain
tasks, such as bidding for an Executor job.

Payments Participants pay certain amount of Origo Token in or-
der to participate certain activities, including transac-
tion fees.

Rewards Good participants at Origo get Token rewards for do-
ing well.

Punishments Bad participants lose portion or all of their deposits or

their certain rights are taken away for behaving badly
according to rules.

Table 9.1.: Incentive Set

Origo defines these denotations for such incentives for later discussion:
¢ Token Rewards: R,,--- ,R,, of the nil party

¢ Payment:P,,--- ,P,, of the n't party

¢ Deposits: D,,--- ,D,, of the alt party

¢ Punishments: Pun,,--- ,Pun,, of the nt! party

In addition, Origo defines four roles on its platform:

¢ Validators: V; <¢ V, who provides computation power to the platform to execute
various tasks such as proof verification and block validation; V; receives Ry, after

mining a block or computing a certain task.

¢ Users: U; € U, who utilize contracts or DApps on the platform; U; makes a
deposit Dy, and/or payment P,;, in exchange of a service/product through smart
contracts and DApps; U; could also gain rewards Ry, through a contract or DAPP
if such mechanisms are created by developers.
Cryptoeconomics Design 32

¢ Contract/DAPP Developers: Dev; € Dev, who create privacy preserving smart
contracts and DApps; Dev; make a payment Pp,y, for using computation resource
and obtain rewards Rp,y, for generating smart contracts and DApps.

¢ Executor: E; ¢ E, who conduct privacy related tasks in Zero Knowledge Proof.
E; is forced to make a deposit Dp, by Origo to prevent misconducting, otherwise
receives a punishment Pune. E; can also obtain rewards R-, after completing a
privacy related task.

In order to make incentives sets work for each role, these are the fundamental

protocols:

1. For any activity i on Origo platform,

Du, + Pu, + Poev, + De, 2 Ru, + Ru, + Roev, + Pune, + Re

i

always applies, where Dy, Pu,, Poev, De, Ruy Ru, Roev, Pune, Re, 2 0 all the
time.

2. While Origo lets the supply and demand law decide the exact amount of Dy,, Py,
Prev Dey Rv,r Ru, Roev,, Pung,, Re, on platform,

Du, + Pu, + Poe, + De, = VERv, + Ru, + Roww, + Pure, + Re,

at all time to maintain platform sustainability.
Chapter 10.

Roadmap

2018 December: Originis: Test net release with confidential transaction.

LEGAL DISCLAIMER 51

actual events, the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects
of the Project Company and/or the Token Issuer could be materially and adversely
affected. In such cases, you may lose all or part of the value of the Origo Tokens. Please
refer to the risk factors set out in the last part of this Whitepaper.
Appendix B.

RISK FACTORS

RISKS RELATING TO PARTICIPATION IN THE TOKEN SALE

Investments in startups such as the Token Issuer and the Project Company involve a high
degree of risk.

Financial and operating risks confronting startups are significant and Token Is-
suer and the Project Company are not immune to these. Startups often experience
unexpected problems in the areas of product development, marketing, financing, and
general management, among others, which frequently cannot be solved.

The Token Issuer and/or the Project Company may be forced to cease operations.

It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, an
unfavorable fluctuation in the value of cryptographic and fiat currencies, the inability
by the Token Issuer and/or the Project Company to establish the Origo platform or the
Origo Tokens'utility, the failure of commercial relationships, or intellectual property
ownership challenges, the Token Issuer and/or the Project Company may no longer
be viable to operate and the Token Issuer and/or the Project Company may dissolve
or take actions that result in a dissolution of the Token Issuer and/or the Project
Company.

The tax treatment of the Token Sale Terms, the purchase rights contained therein and the
Token Sale is uncertain and there may be adverse tax consequences for purchasers upon certain

future events.

The tax characterization of the Token Sale Terms and the Origo Tokens is uncertain,
and each purchaser must seek its own tax advice in connection with an investment in

52
RISK FACTORS 53

the Origo Tokens. An investment pursuant to the Token Sale Terms and the purchase of
Origo Tokens pursuant thereto may result in adverse tax consequences to the purchaser,
including withholding taxes, income taxes and tax reporting requirements. Each
purchaser should consult with and must rely upon the advice of its own professional
tax advisors with respect tax treatment of an investment in the Origo Tokens pursuant
to the Token Sale Terms.

There is no prior market for Origo Tokens and the Token Sale may not result in an active or
liquid market for the Tokens

Prior to the Token Sale, there has been no public market for the Origo Tokens. In
the event that the Origo Tokens are traded on a cryptocurrency exchange, there is no
assurance that an active or liquid trading market for the Origo Tokens will develop or
if developed, be sustained after the Origo Tokens have been made available for trading
on such cryptocurrency exchange. There is also no assurance that the market price
of the Origo Tokens will not decline below the consideration at which the purchaser
acquired the Origo Tokens at. Such purchase consideration may not be indicative of
the market price of the Origo Tokens after they have been made available for trading
on a cryptocurrency exchange. A Origo Token is not a currency issued by any central
bank or national, supranational or quasi-national organisation, nor is it backed by
any hard assets or other credit. The Token Issuer is not responsible for nor does it
pursue the circulation and trading of Origo Tokens on the market. Trading of Origo
Tokens merely depends on the consensus on its value between the relevant market
participants, and no one is obliged to purchase any Origo Token from any holder of the
Origo Token, nor does anyone guarantee the liquidity or market price of Origo Tokens
to any extent at any time. Accordingly, the Token Issuer cannot ensure that there will
be any demand or market for Origo Tokens, or that the purchase consideration is
indicative of the market price of Origo Tokens after they have been made available for
trading on a cryptocurrency exchange.

Future sales of the Origo Tokens could materially and adversely affect the market price of
Origo Tokens

Any future sale of the Origo Tokens (which were not available for sale in the Token
Sale) would increase the supply of Origo Tokens in the market and this may result in a
downward price pressure on the Origo Token. The sale or distribution of a significant
number of Origo Tokens outside of the Token Sale, or the perception that such further
RISK FACTORS 54

sales or issuance may occur, could adversely affect the trading price of the Origo
Tokens.

Negative publicity may materially and adversely affect the price of the Origo Tokens

Negative publicity involving (a) the Token Issuer and/or the Project Company;
(b) the Origo plat- form; (c) the Origo Tokens; or (d) any of the key personnel of the
Token Issuer and/or the Project Company, may materially and adversely affect the
market perception or market price of the Origo Tokens, whether or not such publicity
is justified.

There is no assurance of any success of Origo platform

The value of, and demand for, the Origo Tokens hinges heavily on the performance
of the Origo platform. There is no assurance that the Origo platform will gain traction
after its launch and achieve any commercial success.

The Origo platform has not been fully developed, finalized and integrated and is
subject to further changes, updates and adjustments prior to its launch. Such changes
may result in unexpected and unforeseen effects on its projected appeal to users, and
hence impact its success.

While the Token Issuer has made every effort to provide a realistic estimate, there
is also no assurance that the cryptocurrencies raised in the Token Sale will be sufficient
for the development and integration of the Origo platform. For the foregoing or any
other reason, the development and integration of the Origo platform may not be
completed and there is no assurance that it will be launched at all. As such, distributed
Origo Tokens may hold little worth or value, and this would impact its trading price.

The trading price of the Origo Tokens may fluctuate following the Token Sale

The prices of cryptographic tokens in general tend to be relatively volatile, and can
fluctuate significantly over short periods of time. The demand for, and corresponding
the market price of, the Origo Tokens may fluctuate significantly and rapidly in
response to, among others, the following factors, some of which are beyond the control
of the Token Issuer and/or the Project Company:

¢ (a) new technical innovations;
RISK FACTORS 55

¢ (b) analysts'speculations, recommendations, perceptions or estimates of the Origo
Token's market price or the Token Issuer's and/or the Project Company's financial
and business performance;

(c) changes in market valuations and token prices of entities with operations
similar to that of the Token Issuer and/or the Project Company that may be made
available for sale and purchase on the same cryptocurrency exchanges as the
Origo Tokens;

¢ (d) announcements by the Token Issuer and/or the Project Company of significant
events, for example partnerships, sponsorships, new product developments;

¢ (d) fluctuations in market prices and trading volume of cryptocurrencies on

cryptocurrency exchanges;

(e) additions or departures of key personnel of the Token Issuer and/or the Project
Company;

(f) success or failure of the management of the Token Issuer and/or the Project
Company in implementing business and growth strategies; and

(g) changes in conditions affecting the blockchain or financial technology industry,
the general economic conditions or market sentiments, or other events or factors.

RISKS RELATING TO THE WALLET

The loss or compromise of information relating to your Wallet (as defined below) may affect
your access and possession of the Origo Tokens

For purposes of receipt of your Origo Tokens, you are to establish and maintain
access to a cryptocurrency wallet (Wallet). Your access to the Origo Tokens in the
Wallet depends on, among other things, the safeguards to the information to such
Wallet, including but not limited to the user account information, address, private key
and password. In the event that any of the foregoing is lost or compromised, your
access to the Wallet may be curtailed and thereby adversely affecting your access and
possession to the Origo Tokens, including such Origo Tokens being unrecoverable and
permanently lost.
RISK FACTORS 56

The Wallet or Wallet service provider may not be technically compatible with the Origo
Tokens

The Wallet or Wallet service provider may not be technically compatible with the
Origo Tokens which may result in the delivery of Origo Tokens being unsuccessful or
affect your access to such Origo Tokens.

RISKS RELATING TO THE TOKEN ISSUER AND THE PROJECT COMPANY

The Origo platform is intended to be developed, operated and maintained by
the Token issuer and/or the Project Company. Any events or circumstances which
adversely affect the Token Issuer and/or the Project Company may have a correspond-
ing adverse effect on the Token Issuer and/or the Project Company if such events
or circumstances affect the Token Issuer's and/or the Project Company's ability to
maintain the Origo platform. This would correspondingly have an impact the trading
price of the Origo Tokens.

The Token Issuer and/or the Project Company may be materially and adversely affected
if they fail to effectively manage its operations as their business develops and evolves, which
would have a direct impact on their ability to maintain the Origo platform and consequently
the trading price of the Origo Tokens.

The financial technology and cryptocurrency industries and the markets in which
the Token Issuer and the Project Company compete have grown rapidly and continue
to grow rapidly, and continue to evolve in response to new technological advances,
changing business models and other factors. As a result of this constantly changing
environment, the Token Issuer and/or the Project Company may face operational
difficulties in adjusting to the changes, and the sustainability of the Token Issuer and
the Project Company will depend on their ability to manage their respective operations,
adapt to technological advances and market trends and ensure that they hire qualified
and competent employees, and provide proper training for their personnel.

As their respective business evolves, the Token Issuer and the Project Company
must also expand and adapt its operational infrastructure. The Token Issuer's and the
Project Company's respective businesses rely on blockchain-based software systems,
cryptocurrency wallets or other related token storage mechanisms, blockchain technol-
ogy and smart contract technology, and to manage technical support infrastructure
RISK FACTORS 57

for the Origo platform effectively, the Token Issuer and the Project Company will
need to continue to upgrade and improve their data systems and other operational
systems, procedures and controls. These upgrades and improvements will require
a dedication of resources, are likely to be complex and increasingly rely on hosted
computer services from third parties that the Token Issuer and/or the Project Com-
pany do not control. If the Token Issuer and/or the Project Company are unable to
adapt their respective systems and organization in a timely, efficient and cost-effective
manner to accommodate changing circumstances, its business, financial condition
and results of operations may be adversely affected. If the third parties whom the
Token Issuer and/or the Project Company rely on are subject to a security breach
or otherwise suffer disruptions that impact the respective services the Token Issuer
and/or the Project Company utilize, the integrity and availability of their respective
internal information could be compromised, which may consequently cause the loss
of confidential or proprietary information, and economic loss. The loss of financial,
labor or other resources, and any other adverse effect on the Token Issuer's and/or
the Project Company's respective business, financial condition and operations, would
have a direct adverse effect on the Token Issuer's and the Project Company's ability to
maintain the Origo platform. As the Origo platform is the main product to which the
Origo Tokens relate, this may adversely impact the trading price of the Origo Tokens.

The Token Issuer and/or the Project Company may experience system failures, unplanned
interruptions in its network or services, hardware or software defects, security breaches or
other causes that could adversely affect the Token Issuer’s and/or the Project Company's
infrastructure network, and/or the Origo platform

The Token Issuer and the Project Company are unable to anticipate when there
would be occurrences of hacks, cyber-attacks, mining attacks (including but not limited
to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks and selfish-mining attacks),
distributed denials of service or errors, vulnerabilities or defects in the Origo platform,
the Origo Tokens, the Wallet or any technology (including but not limited to smart
contract technology) on which the Token Issuer and/or the Project Company, the
Origo platform, the Origo Tokens and the Wallet relies or on the Ethereum blockchain
or any other blockchain. Such events may include, for example, flaws in programming
or source code leading to exploitation or abuse thereof. The Token Issuer and/or the
Project Company may not be able to detect such hacks, mining attacks (including but
not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks and selfish-mining
attacks), cyber-attacks, distributed denials of service errors vulnerabilities or defects
RISK FACTORS 58

in a timely manner, and may not have sufficient resources to efficiently cope with
multiple service incidents happening simultaneously or in rapid succession.

The Token Issuer's and/or the Project Company's respective network or services,
which would include the Origo platform, could be disrupted by numerous events,
including natural disasters, equipment breakdown, network connectivity downtime,
power losses, or even intentional disruptions of their respective services, such as
disruptions caused by software viruses or attacks by unauthorized users, some of
which are beyond the Token Issuer's and/or the Project Company's control. Although
the Token Issuer and the Project Company will be taking steps against malicious
attacks on their respective appliances or infrastructure, which are critical for the
maintenance of the Origo platform and their respective other services, there can be
no assurance that cyber-attacks, such as distributed denials of service, will not be
attempted in the future, and that any of the Token Issuer's and the Project Company's
intended enhanced security measures will be effective. The Token Issuer and the
Project Company may also be prone to attacks on their respective infrastructure
intended to steal information about their respective technology, financial data or user
information or take other actions that would be damaging to the Token Issuer, the
Project Company and users of the Origo platform. Any significant breach of the Token
Issuer's and/or the Project Company's intended security measures or other disruptions
resulting in a compromise of the usability, stability and security of the Token Issuer's
and/or the Project Company's network or services (including the Origo platform) may
adversely affect the trading price of the Origo Tokens.

The Token Issuer and the Project Company are dependent in part on the location and data
centre facilities of third parties

The Token Issuer's and the Project Company's infrastructure network will be in
part established through servers that which they respectively own and house at the
location facilities of third parties, and servers that they respectively rent at data center
facilities of third parties. If the Token Issuer and/or the Project Company are unable
to renew their respective data facility lease on commercially reasonable terms or at
all, the Token Issuer and/or the Project Company may be required to transfer their
respective servers to a new data center facility, and may incur significant costs and
possible service interruption in connection with the relocation. These facilities are also
vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among others, natural disasters, arson,
terrorist attacks, power losses, and telecommunication failures. Additionally, the
third party providers of such facilities may suffer a breach of security as a result of
RISK FACTORS 59

third party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise and a third party may
obtain unauthorized access to the data in such servers. As techniques used to obtain
unauthorized access to, or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are
not recognized until launched against a target, the Token Issuer, the Project Company
and the providers of such facilities may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to
implement adequate preventive measures. Any such security breaches or damages
which occur which impact upon the Token Issuer's and/or the Project Company's
infrastructure network and/or the Origo platform may adversely impact the price of
the Origo Tokens.

General global market and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on the Token
Issuer's and/or the Project Company's operating performance, results of operations and cash
flows

The Token Issuer and/or the Project Company could be affected by general global
economic and market conditions. Challenging economic conditions worldwide have
from time to time, contributed, and may continue to contribute, to slowdowns in the
information technology industry at large. Weakness in the economy could have a
negative effect on the Token Issuer's and/or the Project Company's respective business,
operations and financial condition, including decreases in revenue and operating cash
flows. Additionally, in a down-cycle economic environment, the Token Issuer and/or
the Project Company may experience the negative effects of increased competitive
pricing pressure and a slowdown in commerce and usage of the Origo platform.
Suppliers on which the Token Issuer and/or the Project Company rely for servers,
bandwidth, location and other services could also be negatively impacted by economic
conditions that, in turn, could have a negative impact on the Token Issuer's and/or
the Project Company's respective operations or expenses. There can be no assurance,
therefore, that current economic conditions or worsening economic conditions or a
prolonged or recurring recession will not have a significant adverse impact on the
Token Issuer's and/or the Project Company's respective business, financial condition
and results of operations and hence the Origo platform, which would correspondingly
impact the trading price of the Origo Tokens.

The Token Issuer, the Project Company and/or the Origo Tokens may be affected by newly
implemented regulations

Cryptocurrency trading is generally unregulated worldwide, but numerous reg-
ulatory authorities across jurisdictions have been outspoken about considering the
RISK FACTORS 60

implementation of regulatory regimes which govern cryptocurrency or cryptocurrency
markets. The Token Issuer, the Project Company and/or the Origo Tokens may be
affected by newly implemented regulations relating to cryptocurrencies or cryptocur-
rency markets, including having to take measures to comply with such regulations,
or having to deal with queries, notices, requests or enforcement actions by regulatory
authorities, which may come at a substantial cost and may also require substantial
modifications to the Origo Tokens and/or the Origo platform. This may impact the
appeal of the Origo Tokens and/or the Origo platform for users and result in decreased
usage of the Origo Tokens and/or the Origo platform. Further, should the costs (finan-
cial or otherwise) of complying with such newly implemented regulations exceed a
certain threshold, maintaining the Origo Tokens and/or the Origo platform may no
longer be commercially viable and the Token Issuer and/or the Project Company may
opt to discontinue the Origo Tokens and/or the Origo platform.

Further, it is difficult to predict how or whether government or regulatory authori-
ties may implement any changes to laws and regulations affecting distributed ledger
technology and its applications, including the Origo Tokens and the Origo platform.
The Token Issuer and/or the Project Company may also have to cease their respective
operations in a jurisdiction that makes it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or make
it commercially unviable or undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s)
to operate in such jurisdiction. In scenarios such as the foregoing, the trading price of
Origo Tokens will be adversely affected or Origo Tokens may cease to be traded.

The regulatory regime governing the blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, tokens and
token offerings such as Token Sale, the Origo platform and the Origo Tokens is uncertain, and
regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Origo platform
and the utility of the Origo Tokens

Regulation of tokens (including the Origo Tokens) and token offerings such as the
Token Sale, cryptocurrencies, blockchain technologies, and cryptocurrency exchanges
currently is undeveloped and likely to rapidly evolve, varies significantly among inter-
national, federal, state and local jurisdictions and is subject to significant uncertainty.
Various legislative and executive bodies in Singapore and other countries may in the
future, adopt laws, regulations, guidance, or other actions, which may severely impact
the development and growth of the Origo platform and the adoption and utility of
the Origo Tokens. Failure by the Token Issuer, the Project Company or users of the
Origo platform to comply with any laws, rules and regulations, some of which may
not exist yet or are subject to interpretation and may be subject to change, could result
RISK FACTORS 61

in a variety of adverse consequences, including civil penalties and fines. Blockchain
networks also face an uncertain regulatory landscape in many foreign jurisdictions
such as the European Union, China, South Korea and Russia. Various foreign jurisdic-
tions may, in the near future, adopt laws, regulations or directives that affect the Origo
platform. Such laws, regulations or directives may directly and negatively impact the
Token Issuer's and/or the Project Company's respective business. The effect of any
future regulatory change is impossible to predict, but such change could be substantial
and materially adverse to the development and growth of the Origo platform and the
adoption and utility of the Tokens.

New or changing laws and regulations or interpretations of existing laws and
regulations may materially and adversely impact the value of the currency in which
the Origo Tokens may be sold, the value of the distributions that may be made by
the Token Issuer and/or the Project Company, the liquidity of the Origo Tokens, the
ability to access marketplaces or exchanges on which to trade the Origo Tokens, and
the structure, rights and transferability of Origo Tokens.

Origo Token holders will have no control on the Token Issuer or the Project Company

The holders of Origo Tokens are not and will not be entitled, to vote or receive
dividends or be deemed the holder of capital stock of the Token Issuer or the Project
Company for any purpose, nor will anything be construed to confer on the purchasers
any of the rights of a stockholder of the Token Issuer or the Project Company or any
right to vote for the election of directors or upon any matter submitted to stockholders
at any meeting thereof, or to give or withhold consent to any corporate action or to
receive notice of meetings, or to receive subscription rights or otherwise. Purchasers
may lack information for monitoring their investment the purchasers of Origo Tokens
may not be able to obtain all information it would want regarding the Token Issuer,
the Project Company, the Origo Tokens, or the Origo platform, on a timely basis or
at all. It is possible that purchasers may not be aware on a timely basis of material
adverse changes that have occurred. While the Token Issuer has made efforts to use
open-source development for Origo Tokens, this information may be highly technical
by nature. As a result of these difficulties, as well as other uncertainties, Purchasers
may not have accurate or accessible information about the Origo platform.

SPARTAN

Spartaninu White Mission

(White Paper)

PREMISE

The SPARTAN movement started as a simple damning question that every
developer or creator faces. It's not a complex question, nor does it seem like a
daunting one; some choose to brainstorm it first or attack it upon completion.
And without fail, it becomes one of the biggest potential headaches for all
parties involved with its conception.

That question is, the name.

SPARTAN actually came to us fairly quickly. With a nod to its reputable
predecessors that became the meme-coin giants, and with the launch of the
video game (of which we have no association with) and its sprawling and
inspiring creativity, we set out to work.

Anyone that played the games we're referencing knows that they're preserved in
history and legacy as one of the embodiments of nostalgia in 2000s gaming.
With that in mind, we intend to uphold that honor with the respect and dignity it
deserves.

Beyond being the coolest and cutest meme-coin, the funds from Spartan Inu's
marketing wallet will be allocated towards the acquisition, management, funding,
sponsoring, or building of a team involved with eSports. The community will
have substantial weight in determining the game in question, the players/team
involved and the critical strides taken to achieve this feat. Any and all healthy
skepticism will be addressed to ensure that the majority of the community is
assured by our goals.

THE LAUNCH

We did the fair launch with 1.7 ethereum Ip'd and saved 3.5% supply and the
little bit left over on the smart contract. The left over tokens after securing initial
trustworthy parties for marketing will be used raise liquidity to negate dumps at
an opportune time, will be burnt, or will be OTC traded/sold to a CEX to get an
exchange listing. There is a 2% max tx (this is verifiable via contract) and a 25%
penalty within the first 24 hours with a 1% reflection, and 8% with 1% reflection
thereafter. Bots that sniped and buyers that overinvested with too much of the
supply percentage sold. And the table was reset once more.

CONCLUSION

We honor our Spartans and the legacy of Spartansâ€™ past by executing this
uniquely different than meme-coins of similar or greater financial standing and
repute, and it is borne of the same honor that you'd acknowledge an elite soldier
fitted with Recon Armor and a flaming skull. We intend to immortalize SPARTAN
and Spartantnu into the annals of present and future cryptocurrency history, and
were enthuastic and humbled that you might share our eagerness in our vision
for the future.

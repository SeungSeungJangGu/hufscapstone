Abstract

Bitcoin Diamond (BCD) is a fork of Bitcoin; at predetermined block height 495866, the new chain
was created. As the original Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain continues on unaltered, this new
cryptocurrency now operates on its own chain called “Bitcoin Diamond”. With Bitcoin Diamond,
miners will begin creating blocks using a new proof-of-work algorithm which better serves
Satoshi’s original goal of keeping Bitcoin decentralized. Bitcoin Diamond offers several technical
advancements in scalability along with anti-replay protection and wallet enhancements. With these
changes to the Bitcoin protocol, Bitcoin Diamond seeks to achieve Satoshi Nakamoto's vision for a
peer-to-peer electronic cash system that’s accessible and usable to everyone, regardless of

economic status or country of origin.

Introduction

After nine years of rapid development, Bitcoin can no longer meet the demands of its rising numbers of
clients. Bitcoin has high transaction fees, slow transaction confirmations, and high thresholds for new miners.
Furthermore, Bitcoin has still failed to adopt scaling solutions such as SegWit, with well over half of current
Bitcoin transactions still using the older, less efficient protocol. As adoption for digital currency continues to
outpace Bitcoin’s ability to scale, there is a danger that Satoshi’s digital cash will eventually fall behind other

payment platforms.

Bitcoin Diamond addresses these flaws by implementing new technical improvements that resolve issues
concerning BTC’s high transaction cost and slow confirmations. By combining Segregated Witness with an 8
MB block size, BCD is capable of performing over 100 transactions per second or 4.8 million a day, over 10
times the current speed of BTC. BCD prevents the centralization of mining power by using X13 Proof of Work,
a mining algorithm that is resistant to ASICs and friendly to GPUs. In addition to these starting enhancements,
the BCD development team is working on the implementation of the Lightning Network as well as wallet

clients across multiple platforms.

Origins

Bitcoin Diamond was forked off the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain on November 24, 2017 at block height 495866
after Team EVEY and Team 007 partnered to develop the necessary upgrades to improve upon Bitcoin’s
original framework. Bitcoin Diamond developers have incorporated a new proof-of-work algorithm and will

continue to enhance original Bitcoin features with greater speed, protection, and scalability.

Bitcoin Diamond raised the block size limit from 2-4 MB to 8-32 MB as part of a massive on-chain
scaling approach to create ample capacity for higher transaction storage. The transaction capacity
of blocks will be increased five-fold and the ultimate goal is to improve transaction confirmation
speed for the entire blockchain. With the addition of SegWit, transactions can now scale at a far
greater pace than any Bitcoin chain before it. Bitcoin Diamond also offers replay protection as the
format for transactions has been changed since the BCD fork. This means that BTC transactions
cannot be replayed in the BCD network as a way to steal user funds.

BCD’s objectives are to foster the widespread use of Bitcoin Diamond around the world, to
empower unbanked people to use Bitcoin Diamond to build wealth for themselves and their
families, to establish Bitcoin Diamond as the number one cryptocurrency used in emerging
economies, and to make Bitcoin Diamond accessible and usable for everyday transactions. The
total amount of Bitcoin diamond is ten times that of Bitcoin which translates into a cost reduction
for new participation and a reduction of necessary thresholds. Regardless of scalability, a chain is
only as strong as its consensus. To reduce the danger of mining centralization, Bitcoin Diamond
uses an algorithm that makes it incredibly difficult for single entities to command large stakes of
the processing power for block validation.

Hard Fork

In blockchain, a hard fork is a change to a cryptographic protocol that causes a permanent divergence from
the previous version. When this change occurs, all users must decide whether to adopt the new protocol (fork
to the new chain) or continue to support the old protocol. If enough users remain on the old chain, two
blockchains will then exist which possess identical transactions from before the fork, but now run on separate
chains with their own unique history, nodes and protocols. It was through this kind of hard fork that Bitcoin

Cash, Bitcoin Gold, Segwit 2x, and now Bitcoin Diamond were created from the original Bitcoin chain.

Bitcoin Diamond was forked on November 24, 2017 when BCD nodes began to support the new
protocol after block 495866 and branched away from the BTC chain. From this block onwards,
BTC miners are no longer able to mine blocks on the BCD chain and vice versa. Since both chains
share the same transaction history from before the split, anyone that owned BTC at the time of the

fork would now own ten times the amount in BCD.

Transactions

Larger Blocks for Faster Transaction Confirmations

Bitcoin Diamond raised the block size limit to 8MB as part of a massive on-chain scaling approach.
There is now ample capacity for everyone's transactions to be processed. The transaction
capacity of blocks will be increased five-fold and the ultimate goal is to improve transaction
confirmation speed for the entire blockchain. With lightning fast transactions, highly diluted
transaction fees, and ten times as much supply as other leading Bitcoin forks, Bitcoin Diamond’s
blockchain prioritizes trust, accessibility, and affordability.

While there are concerns that large blocks may rapidly increase the blockchain’s total size, the
present number of transactions included in each block is still far from hitting the upper limit of the
block size. In case of a future volume increase, additional mechanisms such as sharding are
already being considered to reduce the problem of storing a colossal blockchain size.

Lowering Transaction Costs with a Larger Supply

Bitcoin Diamond reduces the transaction fees and the cost of participation: The total amount of
BCD is 10 times that of BTC so that it reduces the cost of participation. BCD improves the situation
of overpriced Bitcoin, increasing the total supply of BCD and lowering the price. This supply
change increases circulation and helps emphasizes the use of BCD for small businesses and
microtransactions. With relatively low transaction fees, a secure and private blockchain, and
affordable coin prices, Bitcoin Diamond is well suited for making everyday transactions.

Segregated Witness to Optimize Storage

Segregated Witness (SegWit) is the process by which signatures in a Bitcoin transaction are
“segregated” from the transactions data. SegWit defines a new structure called a “witness” that is
committed to blocks separately from the merkle tree that holds transactions. By removing
signature data in this manner, 65% of storage space is freed up so that block capacity for
transactions is increased.

Transaction hash includes sender’s public key and signature Signatures are relocated away from the transaction hash in the “Witness”

to increase capacity and curb mallleability attacks

In addition to optimizing storage, SegWit also prevents malleability attacks by which a receiver
modifies a sender’s transaction ID in order to get more coins. Since digital signatures are now
separate under SegWit, the attacker cannot change a transaction ID without also nullifying the
digital signature.

Anti-Replay Protection

A so-called replay attack can occur when valid transactions on the BTC chain are “replayed” on
the BCD chain. Using this strategy, attackers could use valid BTC transaction to rob users of BCD
even though both chains have forked. To prevent this, the transaction format of BCD has been
changed since the fork so that BTC transactions cannot be mistaken as valid.

These changes to transaction format include:

e Anew transaction version number of 12, rather than BTC’s 1-3.

e Anew field called “Present Block Hash” which contains the hash value of a block’s
header... For example, when the transaction sent at the height 500020, the field takes the
hash value of block 500020, 500019 or 500018. The value is not strictly checked
currently, so all transactions matching the format can be verified

Additional changes to BCD’s transaction format are planned for the future. This will include
features like transaction proofs and periods of transaction validity. You can compare the
transaction format differences between BTC and BCD in the diagram below:

Proof-of-Work Algorithm

Satoshi Nakamoto designed Bitcoin’s mining system as a way for majority decisions to be made ona
peer-to-peer basis. This Proof-of-Work used CPU power to guarantee that nodes were fairly represented with

“one-CPU-one-vote”.

Satoshi decided to use SHA-256 as the algorithm for this Proof-of-work, which worked well for several years.
However, as Bitcoin gained popularity, the mining sector has become more and more competitive. The
development of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) now means that anyone with access to the

latest mining hardware can outpace traditional CPU miners with ease.

For Bitcoin to remain decentralized, a new mining algorithm must be implemented that can resist attempts by

hardware manufacturers to outpace traditional miners.

To restore fair mining practices, Bitcoin Diamond utilizes and has improved upon the X13 Proof-of-Work
algorithm. This means that all ASICs designed for Bitcoin SHA-256 are now entirely ineffective on BCD. With
X13, creating new ASIC hardware is made incredibly difficult by a high level of complexity, reducing the threat

of mining centralization. X13 was specifically created for graphics card mining, a standard of hardware that is

widely accessible so that competition for mining is fair for the average user.

While the X13 algorithm existed before BCD’s launch, the X13 development team has added additional
improvements to BCD’s version to bolster and ensure security. This includes the SM3 hash algorithm, issued
by the Chinese Cryptography Administration in 2016 as the national standard for cryptographic applications.
Currently, BCD is the only cryptocurrency to utilize the X13 algorithm in this manner. As time goes on, BCD’s
development team will continue to improve its mining algorithm to ensure that Satoshi’s original vision for

distributed consensus remains intact.

Lightning Network

While Bitcoin Diamond protocol provides faster transactions, additional scaling solutions are still required for
the protocol to compete with traditional payment methods. To accomplish this, the BCD development team is
working to implement Lightning Network, a "second layer" payment protocol first proposed by Joseph Poon
and Thaddeus Dryja in 2016. This solution allows users to open “payment channels” by committing an
amount of Bitcoin that can then be sent to other participants on the channel without being confirmed on the
main chain. Using Lightning Network, Bitcoin Diamond can enable users to make instant transactions at a

nearly limitless pace for a very low cost.

While development on a BTC-version of Lightning is underway using Golang, the BCD team has instead
opted to write their implementation in the C programming language. C was chosen specifically for its
portability and efficiency, allowing it to easily run on a range of different devices and consume less resources
than its BTC counterpart. This version of Lightning Network has already passed functionality tests such as
creating nodes and payment channels, declaring and paying transaction requests, confirming receipts across
nodes, and testing payments between senders and receivers. A stable version is expected to be deployed

on July 31, 2018, after a complete assessment by developers and testers.

Wallet Features

HD Wallet Generation

Hierarchical deterministic wallets, otherwise known as HD wallets, is a feature implemented on
BCD to create multiple accounts from a single root key. With this rule, clients only need to save a
master private key, which can generate multiple sub-private keys and sub-addresses. Clients can
now easily manage the balances of all accounts under this one master private key and selectively
issue child keys with limited access. This helps reduce the possibility of a master private key
exposure, ensuring the safety of funds.

Electrum Integration

Electrum is a lightweight Bitcoin wallet that has been developed and supported since 2011. By
operating in conjunction with servers that index the blockchain, Electrum clients can run with
instant startup times and low resource usage. Electrum also offers a wide range of functionality
including cold storage, multisig security and integration with hardware wallets. To capitalize on
Electrum’s feature-set, Bitcoin Diamond has released its own version of the Electrum wallet. After
downloading the wallet, users can quickly connect to the BCD network and claim any coins that
they may have earned from the November fork.

BCD Pay Mobile

To ensure that all users can easily perform payments, Bitcoin Diamond will be the first Bitcoin
project to support an official mobile wallet. An Android wallet based on Electrum has already been
released with an iOS version currently under development. Current wallet features include wallet
name modification, account switching, and QR scanning. With BCD Pay, digital currency will be
made accessible to millions of unbanked individuals in emerging markets, bypassing the financial
barriers that had previously excluded them from the global economy.

How to Acquire Bitcoin Diamond

Users who held BTC at the time Bitcoin Diamond was created have automatically become owners
of BCD. Please note that a wallet with 1 BTC will hold 10 BCD based on the supply change. Users
may also earn BCD by mining with graphics cards or buying coins from an exchange or secondary
market. To encourage the community to assist in the construction of BCD’s ecosystem,
contributors will receive specific amounts of BCD as a reward as well.

Roadmap

Bitcoin Diamond’s purpose is to help unbanked and financially underserved people in ways that
benefit them. The Bitcoin Diamond initiative will especially focus on people living in areas where
other currencies and financial institutions have failed them, such as international transactions,
security, and wealth storage. Ultimately, this will increase adoption and usage of Bitcoin Diamond
and provide marginalized people with a currency that works in their interest. Our objectives
include fostering the widespread use of Bitcoin Diamond around the world, empowering
unbanked people to use Bitcoin Diamond to build wealth for themselves, establishing Bitcoin
Diamond as the number one cryptocurrency in emerging economies, and making Bitcoin Diamond
accessible and usable for everyday transactions. We seek to achieve our ultimate goal of Bitcoin
Diamond becoming the “Bitcoin” that achieves Satoshi’s vision of becoming a globally accepted
digital cash. With this in mind, Bitcoin Diamond will strive to provide better solutions for financial

services worldwide.

This plan (Dec 2017 “ 2018 Q2) is generated by Bitcoin Diamond Community, based on the
communication with the BCD development teams EVEY and 007.

As of July 2018, the Bitcoin Diamond TestNet is running smoothly, with new versions to be
released soon that will integrate several updates. Updates that are expected to be in the next
version include but are not limited to: new boost version requirements with a v1.47.0 minimum,
upgraded ZMQ to Python3 support, Unify code style, ability to delete redundant priority
judgement code, return error codes, modification of some misleading hints, reconstructing
ZapWalletTxes to increase stability, addition of functions to create purses through JSON RPC
requests, replacement of old syntax with new C++ features, optimization of namespaces, updated
annotations, expansion of documents, and increased document readability.

Conclusion

We have proposed a new system for electronic transactions with the mission to make digital
currency accessible and usable for everyone, regardless of their economic status, country of
origin, or level of ability. With lightning fast transactions, highly diluted transaction fees, and ten
times as much supply as other leading Bitcoin forks, our blockchain prioritizes trust, accessibility,
and affordability. ln an age where many people are forced to serve money, Bitcoin Diamond is a
currency that serves the people. With the BCD Pay initiative, we are able to help the unbanked
and financially underserved people in ways that benefit them. The initiative will especially focus on
people living in areas where other currencies and financial institutions have failed them, such as
international transactions, security, and wealth storage. Ultimately, this will increase adoption and
usage of Bitcoin Diamond and provide marginalized people with a currency that works in their
interest. In order to maximize the adoption of Bitcoin Diamond in emerging markets, we have
identified several action steps the Bitcoin Diamond Foundation should take. The BCD Pay initiative
will include a range of offerings, including community engagement, educational initiatives, the
BCD Pay International Marketplace, and online infrastructure. BCD will continue to work towards
making the coin increasingly accessible and usable.

What's esports?

Esports is a competitive branch of video gaming. It divides into professional leagues and amateur
leagues. More than 50% of gamers are playing one or more competitive titles.

Teams and individuals compete in tournaments or head to head matches with prize pools up to
20 million dollars. Games are organized and broadcasted just like major sports events. More than
350 min fans are constantly watching gameplay through platforms like Twitch and Youtube. This
number is projected to double by 2022. Esports is hitting mainstream attracting the interest of
companies like MTG, ESPN, Coca Cola and others. It's the future of digital entertainment and
competitive sporting events along with every surrounding industry.

Digital gameplay is already more popular as entertainment
than music or print and it will soon overtake film.
Arnd Benninghoff, CEO of eSports and gaming group MTGx

Summary
Esportbits — a new esports standard for clearing and engagement.

Esportbits token fuels emission, price discovery and third-party cross asset exchange of illiquid
long-tail digital assets with zero transaction fee.

Demand drivers

01. Liquidity. Integration of new liquidity providers requires reserves to fund smart contract
relays. Each digital item create will have smart contract reserves that will be used to
guarantee asset fiat liquidity.

02. Clearing. Esportbits reserves are used for riskless clearing & settlement. Employing a
standard emission structure and token for all digital assets allows for seamless value
transfer without risks.

03. Staking. Zero fees require token staking.

Competitive advantage
01. HLT is a zero-fee transaction network.
02. Our products are the first to introduce in-game items airdrops.

03. Wallet and UX-strategy tailored for gamers allowing for item visualization.

Investment case

01. Esportbits token supply is almost entirely reserved by the partner and portfolio network for
staking, liquidity and clearing purposes. A very limited number of tokens is released for sales
and enter the market as a trading/purchasing tool.

02. As the token is mineable, masternodes will require up to 10% of the token supply.
03. Over 200,000 users across all partner networks for items airdrops.

04. Anew type of graphic-enhanced crypto wallet tailored for video gamers. Currently
partnering up with a crypto-bank.

Integrated partners/tokens

Risk mitigation

01. Digital rights. Currently digital rights are controlled by top game publishers. Digital assets
“sold" now are not event assets. Turning them into real tradeable items is one of the key tasks
for Esportbits.

02. Smart Contract & liquidity. It's important all items listed have corresponding fiat reserves. This
means that our smart contracts can be hacked, or stable coins used will not be tradeable one
to one to the fiat analogue.

03. Storage of user data. Storage of user data is subject to a number of regulations. We utilize
partner services if storage is needed and adhere to the best practices.

04. Our masternode token can be identified as a security token requiring additional registration
procedures.

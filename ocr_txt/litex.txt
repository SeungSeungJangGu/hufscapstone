LITEX - The First Decentralized Instant
Cryptocurrency Payment Solution

1. Summary

The proliferation of cryptocurrencies and the associated high market capitalizations in recent years have
drawn worldwide attention. However, practical usage is still very limited. Long confirmation time and high
transaction fees are two prominent obstacles in making cryptocurrency micropayment a reality. Volatile
prices in cryptocurrency markets (a 50% loss of value could happen in a matter of few days) also make it
much less desirable a payment medium comparing to fiat money. On top of that, the high level of relevant
background knowledge required to fully understand cryptocurrency has limited the number of potential

merchants.

Currently, the only practical way to adopt cryptocurrency in micropayment is to settle instantly with
merchants using fiat money to avoid high entry barrier and price volatility. The key, though, is to ensure
decentralization of the crypto-to-fiat conversion for settlement, which otherwise could be easily achieved

by a centralized solution.

We firmly believe in the core value of decentralization inherent in cryptocurrency and blockchain
technology and think any centralization would significantly impact the crypto-ecosystem’s healthy growth
in the long run. Just as there’s no official institution to run Bitcoin, there should not be a centralized
organization to convert cryptocurrency to fiat money in the settlement process of any cryptocurrency

micropayment solution.

The rapid increase in transaction volume has crowded the mainnets of the major cryptocurrencies and
resulted in long transaction time with high transaction fees. An interim idea of branching out new chains
with either larger blocks or shortened block generation time was proposed, but it cannot solve the problem
fundamentally: First, to ensure there are enough independent miners that can afford storage and connection
speed requirements, there must be limitations on block size and generation time. Otherwise, when only
large conglomerates can satisfy these requirements, the decentralized architecture is undermined; Second,
with the exponential growth in transaction volume, the limit of block size and generation time will soon be

reached, which leaves no toom for further change.

It is likely that most of the future transactions will be micropayments, which could not bear the high
transaction fees and long confirmation time. If these micropayments could happen off-chain in a secure
environment, using on-chain only for confirming the final results, the solution can adapt to the growing

transaction volume and offer lower transaction fees.
Lightning Network is a technical solution, through RSMC and HTLC in BOLT protocol, that ensures the
security of off-chain transactions are equivalent to those on-chain ones. Its design also guarantees faster

speed and lower fees, which makes Lightning Network currently the most promising solution.

Following the activation of SegWit, Bitcoin’s Lightning Network has been developing rapidly. There are
several payment solution proposals, but few of them incorporates fiat money settlement. For those that do,
they plan to use self-built capital pools to draw cash ftom the secondary market and settle with merchants
through corporate accounts, essentially a centralized solution in the crypto-to-fiat exchange area. Both

BitPay, the largest Bitcoin payment gateway, and TenX, the ex-partner of Visa, are in this category.

Let’s take a closer look at these centralized solutions: First, the exchanges are vulnerable to single point of
failure threat events such as attacks from hackers and accidental crashes. Solutions dependent on the
exchanges will be negatively affected, and the assets in those exchanges are under the tisk of complete loss
upon these accidents; Second, the settlement with merchants through corporate accounts creates a single
solid link between an organization and the payment solution, which exposes the exchange to single point
of failure threat events brought by the solvency and reliability of the organization. Therefore, a stable and
long-lasting cryptocurrency payment solution must provide decentralized solution in fiat money settlement

process.

LITEX is a completely decentralized payment ecosystem for cryptocurrency. Built on the business model
of YeePay’s star product (the non-bankcard payment solution) along with the BOLT protocol, the LTXN

(LITEX Network) enables crypto-purchasets to pay fiat money to merchants on behalf of customers for
products and services, and the customers repay ctyptocurrency to the purchasers. The whole process is

insured by smart contracts, no centralized organization is involved.

There are two layers in LTXN’s architecture. The first layer is an upper-layer decision-making network that
matches the payment requests and the fiat money requests. The second layer is a lower-layer lightning
network that builds highly efficient and secure payment channels to transfer the cryptocurrency. The
merchants receive fiat money payments from cryptocurtency purchasers through the acquirers. LTXN also
implements an incentive strategy in the upper-layer decision-making network to reduce the potential

centralization in the lower-layer lightning network.

Advantages:

- Decentralized ecosystem: With fiat money provided by crypto-purchasers, there is no capital pool
for fiat money and official operator is not necessary at all, as a result, LITEX is not exposed to single

point of failure risks.

- High performance, low costs: With the growth of nodes, LITEX can handle millions of payments

per second which can meet the requirement of timeliness in every-day payment scenarios. Meanwhile
the mechanism of sharing the transaction fee by all participants in one transaction make it extremely

low.

- Stabilized settlement: With deep payment industry experience by Litex Foundation and its partners,
LITEX has the ability and social capital to sign up acquirers from all over the world via profit sharing

so that the risks of cooperating with bankcard companies can be avoided.

- Merchant accessibility: With fiat money settlement, LITEX merchants do not need to make any
changes in their current payment gateway. The process of using LITEX to collect money is exactly the

same. There’s no tisk in bearing the volatility of cryptocurrency price.

- Fund security: With payment channels built on smart contract of pre-defined strict rules, balances

on LITEX are stored in the payment channel. No capital loss would occur even if it is attacked.

Even though fiat money is still the dominant form of payment in today’s economy, the age of
ctyptocurrency is on the horizon. With platforms such as Ethereum, people other than pure currency
speculators have started to recognize the practical value of cryptocurrency and are willing to use
cryptocurrencies like LITEX Tokens directly to purchase merchandises or services. In addition, the LITEX
system has the potential to connect the vast population in the developing world (that are not able to
participate in banking services or receive charity) to local merchants and international non-profit

organizations.

LITEX provides a foundational payment structure for the future digital world.
2. Background

2.1. Current State of Cryptocurrency

It was merely 9 years ago, when Satoshi first came up with the concept of Bitcoin, yet according to multiple
ctyptocurrency tracking sites, the total number of cryptocurrencies listed on exchanges have exceeded 1600
as of April 2018. These cryptocurrencies include “currency” cryptocurrencies that compete with Bitcoins
(e.g. Litecoin), “utility” cryptocurrencies that create an infrastructure to be leveraged to build on top of (e.g.
Ethereum or Filecoin) , and various “Application/Platform” cryptocurrencies also called tokens that are
intended to provide functionality to consumers (e.g. tokens generated by DApp on Ethereum). The
proliferation of cryptocurrency reflects the high recognition and expectation of the blockchain technology

from the tech industry and beyond.

However, practical application of cryptocurrency is still quite limited. With the exponential growth of
market cap and number of cryptocurrencies, high price volatility becomes a norm. Circulation of
ctyptocurrencies is mainly from exchange transactions for trading purposes. Comparing to fiat money,
ctyptocurrency can only be treated as a type of asset that holds value, not in real life payment circulation.
The overheated speculative crypto capital market does bring visibility to the blockchain technology, but at
the end of the day, the true benefit of the technology and the maximum value of cryptocurrency can only
be realized when the consumets s use ctyptocurrency in daily payment scenarios. Merchants accept
ctyptocurrency for goods and services, and the whole society urns into cryptocurrency for myriad of

functions other than speculative trading.

Though external factors such as lack of general understanding from the society and impediment from
traditional interest groups contribute to limited applications of cryptocurrencies, internal factors are more

to blame at this stage. The blockchain technology needs to be further refined, and the development

community needs to reach consensus on major solution proposals. For example, Bitcoin, the starting point
and cornerstone of global cryptocurrencies, due to its insufficient design capacity, slow processing speed
and increasingly impairment of anonymity, still cannot be used as a circulation currency. As of now, 9 years

after its inception, Bitcoin still has no not entered into our daily life.

2.2. Challenges in Micropayment - The Bitcoin Example

A qualified currency in circulation shall have the capability for micropayment and instant payment. By
design, cryptocurrency has inherent advantages over fiat money. However, after 9 years, the mainstream
cryptocurrencies are gradually losing their ability to process micropayment promptly. Bitcoin, for example,

by implementation and evolution of an architecture design that sacrifices efficiency to guarantee consistency
and stability of its distributed ledger system, becomes a type of value asset and a channel for transferring

large value, just like gold in the past.

Originally, a distributed ledger system was designed to make sure the non-repudiation of the transaction
and increase the attacking cost of evil nodes, the ledger system stores data in the chain structure after
packing data, and it guarantees that all nodes in the net reach a consensus spontaneously at all time via a
POW (Proof of Work) system. An asymmetric cryptographic algorithm is adopted for each data package
called ‘Block’ to make sure transactions recorded cannot be modified. This is known as the blockchain

technology today.

Blockchain technology has become an advanced technology researched and developed by commercial
giants and various sovereign governments. This technology contents immense potential value. But Bitcoin,
intended by design to be used as a currency, is greatly limited by its own blockchain technology features.
Firstly, to guarantee the safety & stability and storage efficiency of the system, the upper limit of one block
size is only 1MB. Secondly, to balance the earnings among miners, the system is equipped with a dynamic

difficulty adjusting mechanism to keep a speed of verifying block at a 10-minute interval.

With the average transaction size being 226B, the constant processing speed of the BTC transactions is
about 7 transactions per second. The resulting fact is that the actual transaction size often reaches to 500B
and the processing capacity of BTC system reduces to 3 transactions per second. Furthermore, congestion
of BTC mainnet is increasingly severe along with the increase in the number of BTC transactions. The

following figure is a real-time data cited from blockchain.info on January 16th, 2018.

180157 Unconfirmed Transactions

FABLE 02018 GS(2011)6020  HEARSRAR
‘Summary Status: Connected
Total Fees 41,900.17374317 BTC
Total Size 573615.93 (KB)

Tra

81

It is observed that the average number of transactions generated by the mainnet per second reaches 81.47,
nearly 11 times of processing speed. The total unconfirmed transactions reach 0.18 million. The system still
needs 6 more hours to deal with those transactions even if all new transactions stop coming in immediately.

All of the evidence shows that the BTC main net is indeed very crowded.
Congestion of Bitcoin mainnet delays the confirmation of micropayment even more. As the transaction fee
offered by micropayment is not competitive comparing to payment involving large amount, miners will
first verify the transaction with high transaction fee in order to gain higher profit. As a result, the priority
of micropayment transactions is always lower. Currently, some micropayments may be ignored in the
system for 24 hours, which means, if you want to buy a cup of latte in Starbucks with your Bitcoin directly,

you may have to wait until the next day to get your coffee.

Besides, BTC system set limit for micropayment. In 2013, BT'C’s core team modified the system with
‘Dedusting Patch’ to forbid BTC transaction under certain amount in order to relieve mainnet’s congestion.
At present, the “dust threshold” is 5.46uBTC, which is 14 cents in USD. Transactions lower than the
threshold will be ignored (won’t be relayed, won’t be mined). Transactions lower than 14 cents are actually
not uncommon in some parts of the world. These transactions, however, are unsupported as ‘uneconomic

dust’ in BTC system.

Even for the ones that are above the “dust threshold”, high transaction fees of Bitcoin hindered
micropayment as well. By rising to 1000u/byte in December 2017, fee for one transaction reached up to
16 dollars (assuming transaction volume is 226 bytes and current price of 1 Bitcoin8000 USD.) Obviously,

this is not what micro consumption could afford.

In conclusion, Bitcoin network cannot meet the instant and low transaction fee requirements for
micropayments. Therefore, Bitcoin cannot expand its application to daily consumption, which severely

restricts its potential as a currency.

2.3. The Dawn of Bitcoin - Lightning Network

Since the Bitcoin advocator Gavin Andresen voiced out the urgency of scaling up the mainnet in 2015, the
Bitcoin core team and the entite community have been debating on where the future of Bitcoin is. One
proposal is to directly expand the block size (2MB, 8MB or even no upper limit). This will be at the cost of
sacrificing the stability of system, as the Bitcoin network will be inevitably weakened by a hard fork. Another
proposal insisted that Block size should remain unchanged, meanwhile the capacity and malleability
problems should be solved with off-chain methods in the long run through a soft fork. After a fierce

debating process, the SegWit2x hard fork program, originally scheduled in November 2017 (block height

494,784), came to an end. While SegWit, featuring soft fork, successfully activated 3 months ago, was

determined as a smooth and sustainable solution for Bitcoin eventually.

The principle of SegWit is to move the storage area of the witness information (about 40% of the
transaction capacity, used to verify the transaction in the block). When verifying the block size, the nodes
do not have to calculate this part of the data in a block. The effective block size subsequently scales up to

about 2MB while the logical block scale is still under 1MB. Moreover, SegWit perfectly solved the
Transaction Malleability problem, where a transaction ID (I'xID) is changeable by a third party before final
confirmation. Although Transaction Malleability will not cause systemic consequence, its resolution paved

the way for the most anticipated upgrade of Bitcoin — the Lightning Network.

The Lightning Network is a system of smart contracts (RSMC and HTLC) built on top of the base Bitcoin
blockchain that is intended to allow for fast, cheap payments directly between two patties. instantaneously
send/receive payments and reduce transaction fees by keeping them off the main network. These two

contracts ensure off-chain transactions using bitcoin is as safe as the on-chain transactions.
The Lightning Network has the following advantages in solving the bitcoin challenges:

- Funds security: Users can close the trading channel at any time and apply for withdrawals. The process

is protected by smart contracts.

- Fast: Both parties only need to submit one transaction request to main network when they open or
close the channel. When the channel is open, all transactions are conducted off the mainnet. Each
transaction can be completed in milliseconds regardless of the amount, the system processing speed

can reach to several millions per second.

- Low transaction fee: While the mainnet relies on professional miners to record transactions via the
time/resource consuming mining process, every node in the Lightning Network can function as a hub
without the mining process, fully automated and guaranteed by smart contracts. This means that

transactions can pass quickly in lightning network with a very tiny amount of transaction fee.

- Privacy protection: Since the transaction information in the channel is not recorded on the mainnet,
each node on the main net can only obtain the data of its upstream and downstream nodes. The node
cannot have the access to the details of the transactions conducted in the Lightning Network (such as

payee, payer, total amount of transactions), which protects the privacy of both parties.

The Lightning Network still at the early stage of development, far away from deployment. Given the

context of a successful micropayment system, the Lighting Network still needs to solve the following issues:

-  Cross-chain channel: Needs mainnets of the other major cryptocurrencies to join the effort and be
compatible. The more compatible mainnets there are, the more influential the Lightning Network will

be.

- Smart routing: The upper limit of the payment channel is determined by the smallest link in the

channel. Each transaction needs to find a channel with a higher limit than the transaction amount.

- Complete anonymity: Needs additional encryption protocol to achieve complete anonymity.
- Light node: Each node on the Lightning Network must run a full bitcoin node, which will
undoubtedly limit the applicability of lightning network. Hence, a light node which can run on the

mobile device is required to meet day to day use requirement.

- Centralization tendency: Since the channel capacity varies in sizes, and It costs a certain amount of
service fee to open and close the lightning network channels, there exists the risk of node centralization.
Some mechanisms such as feedback regulation can be added by customizing the protocol to maintain
a healthy and decentralized network topology by using adaptive algorithms. (On this note, LITEX uses a
two-layer network architecture that enables self-adiustment for complex routing and network, health, minimizing the risk

of centralization, which we will discuss in detail in a later section)

The Lightning Network is currently the most promising evolution of Bitcoin and usefully drew some
investment in its R&D effort. Blockstream recently announced that the Lightning Network RC1 was
successfully tested on the mainnet. We can expect more resources joining in this effort to improve the

cryptocurrency eco-system.
3. A Deep Dive

Based on the current challenges, merchants will be unwilling to accept cryptocurrency directly as payment
for quite some time. Not only do they need a deep understanding of the technology which is beyond their
ability and willingness, the price volatility of cryptocurrencies also make the cryptocurrencies hard to be
incorporated into the cost-benefit analysis in day-to-day business transactions. Therefore, the key issue in
ctyptocurrency payment solution is how to convert cryptocurrency into fiat money in real time and to settle

with merchants efficiently with low tisk.

The first necessary step is the cryptocurrency fiat money exchange process. Currently, cryptocurrency is
converted to fiat money in an Exchange, a completely centralized institution. The risk of losing the fund
along with the low effectiveness of transaction processing restricts the possibility of directly linking the
Exchange’s API as part of the payment solution. Some Exchange based solutions introduced a self-
financing capital pool, but this approach also brought new problems, such as pool capacity and price

volatility.

The secondly and more important step is the settlement process. Fiat money settlement requires
coordination among many payment patties, while the merchants bear the full cost (the international average
fee is 2% to 3% of the transaction amount). The figure below illustrates the collaboration flows of the

participating patties :

Put order

Bankcard
Association

In the payment industry, "Acquirer " represents an industrial ecosystem composed of an acquiring bank, a
payment processor and a service provider. The acquiring bank refers to the bank where the merchant has
an account to receive money. The payment processor refers to a company with a third-party payment

license, such as YeePay, WeChat payment, Alipay, etc. They work directly with the banks process
transactions and execute other agreements as well as perform risk control. The service provider refers to
the service company that assists the acquiring banks to equip the merchants with software and hardware
systems, such as POS, which mainly involves interacting directly with consumers, merchants and

maintaining merchant relationships.

As illustrated in the figure above, the easiest way to join this process is to cooperate with bankcard
organizations directly to tap into their vast network of cooperating global issuing banks and acquiring banks.
However, the cryptocurrency borderless payment solution is in direct competition with bankcard
organization’s cross-border settlement business which is their main income source. That means the

bankcard organizations are unlikely to be supportive of cryptocurrency.

Recently, Visa formally announced the any cryptocurrency co-branded cards, and publicly criticized
Bitcoin, stating that they would neither recognize Bitcoin as a currency nor provide Bitcoin payment and
exchange services. MasterCard followed suit. Since most of the existing cryptocurrency payment solutions
relied on the services rendered by bankcard organizations, they now must find another way. The solutions
purely relying on bankcard organizations to complete crypto-fiat settlement is not stable, sustainable or

long term viable.

LITEX team, with deep background in the payment industry, is committed to independently cooperate
with local payment processors all over the world, LITEX is also looking forward to competing with
bankcard organizations, and dethrone them one day with the power of technology. LITEX will make the
convenient, speedy, low cost and secure cryptocurrency micropayment solution a new norm on the world

economic stage.
4. Evolution of Solutions

To make cryptocurrency micropayment a reality, a qualified solution shall be able to solve these basic

problems:

- Long confirmation time

- High transaction fees

- Low adoption from merchants

The best way to solve the first two problems is to avoid transactions in the main chain, which, inevitably,

introduces the security issue. The last problem is solved if merchants can receive fiat currency directly.

However, not all solutions are the same, to what extent the solution upholds decentralization, the core

value of cryptocurrency, determines its long term viability.

According to this standard, we define the current solutions into three categories: centralized, semi-
centralized and decentralized. We will discuss each of them in detail, we will also discuss the ultimate

solution when cryptocurrency is in day-to-day circulation without the help of fiat money.
4.1. Stage 1: Centralization Solution - BitPay

Stage 1
Centralized

Known as the PayPal in the crypto world, BitPay is currently world's largest cryptocurtency (mainly Bitcoin)
payment solution. It encourages merchants to accept Bitcoin payment by providing a way for merchants to
settle in fiat money. Since its inception in 2014, BitPay has already signed up tens of thousands of merchants

worldwide.

The BitPay service model — “merchants transfer their Bitcoins to BitPay, BitPay then converts the Bitcoins
received to fiat money’, is out of date. The increasing high transaction fees have crowded out Bitcoin users,
which forces BitPay raising the merchants’ minimum withdrawal threshold to $100. In order to reduce
setvice fees, users tend to transfer a large amount of Bitcoins to BitPay wallet, while merchants could only
withdraw money over the threshold. Besides, BitPay’s fully centralized model cannot protect the security

of the funds. If BitPay is hacked, users and merchants will lose their assets.
4.2. Stage 2: Semi - Centralization Solution - TenX

Semi-centralized Network J ——_ ————* toe
= TenxX

After the successful deployment of SegWit, many solutions are being built based on the Lightning Network,

its prospect is growing brighter. TenX, an outstanding team, has raised 100,000 ETH within 36 hours of

ICO, which reflected the industry's great expectations in the Lightning Network.

By leveraging the Lightning Network to transfer cryptocurrencies, TenX avoids the single point of failure
tisk caused by storing assets centrally in their official account - even when TenX is attacked, users can still
withdraw their money back to their own wallet on the main chain guaranteed by the use of RSMC smart
contract without worrying about losing them. But that is only half the equation in the full payment process,
the cryptocurrency still needs to convert to fiat money for settlement. For this, TenX chooses to cooperate
with Visa to issue a co-branded credit card. Since Visa has officially exited the crypto-fiat exchange business,
the exchanges are executed by the issuer or its administrator through an encrypted program, which means
Visa is just a settlement channel. Moreover, its so-called promotion of cryptocurrency consumption is very

similar to a reward points system, it does not involve any crypto-fiat exchanges, so TenX can only finalize

the transactions with the help of centralized exchange centers.

Besides, settling with merchants through bankcard organizations like Visa means entrusting half of its core
business to its partner. As a cryptocurrency payment solution, TenX will grow into a competitor of Visa,
which will lead to an unstable relationship. On January 6 2018, Visa announced the ending of its
cooperation with Wave Crest, a debit card supplier. Wave Crest has issued cryptocurrency co-branded cards
with TenX, CryptoPay, Bitwala, Wirex, which leads to debit cards jointly issued by TenX and Visa cannot

be used anymore.
4.3. Stage 3: Decentralization Solution - LITEX

Network

Both BitPay and TenX are highly dependent on either centralized bankcard organizations like Visa or
centralized processes to exchange cryptocurrency to fiat money, which have brought potential risks to their
business model. This problem can only be solved by a fully decentralized payment model, and LITEX is

exactly such a solution.

The LITEX framework does not reply on any centralized partners or processes. Both the cryptocurrency

transfer and the fiat money conversion and settlement are done independently and coordinated by LTXN
independent user nodes, carried out by LITEX Network (LTXN) nodes via a complex matching model
and a routing algorithm. During this process, customers complete payment with cryptocurrency
immediately even if the amount is small; merchants receive the priced fiat money for the setvice/goods
rendered, without being restricted by minimum withdrawal threshold; coin purchasers also get

ctyptocurrencies they need at low cost, which can be used for consumption or any other purpose.

On top of solving the long confirmation time and high cost problems in cryptocurrency payment, LITEX
also guarantees security of the consumers’ and merchants! funds. During the aforementioned transaction
ptocess , if any problem happen to a node, the transaction can be switched to another path to continue
seamlessly; if most of the nodes are paralyzed and failed the transaction, the funds will be withdrawn
automatically back to the account in the main chain or refunded to the fiat money account in accordance

with RSMC protocol.
4.4. Final Stage: Cryptocurrency Circulation

Final Stage g

Network

Consumers pay with cryptocurrency, merchants settle with cryptocurrency, the demand of exchange
between fiat money and cryptocurrency is greatly reduced or even vanished in the future, all of which is the
new ctyptocurrency payment ecosystem in our vision. LITEX will play a very important role on this journey

towards this new ecosystem, and our value is beyond the current transition stage.

In a completely cryptocurrency trading scenario, the large-scale and fully-connected LITEX has gain
advantages in this field and LITEX will still be the most efficient and economic payment channel to use
with minimal to no adaptation. The first-mover advantage help to maintain users, making LITEX still

consumers’ first and best payment choice.

The diagram above illustrates the overall architecture of LITEX. The solid lines represent the flow of the
tangible elements of transaction, like currency and products; the dotted lines represent the flow of
transactional data and system information in LITEX. R is called preimage which is equivalent as a secret
code. Users with this code can ask for cryptocurrency from their upstream party in the payment flow. The

mechanism of HTLC smart contract can guarantee the automatic transactions in the whole flow.

The operation of LITEX consists mainly of two processes. The main process is the process that a consumer
purchases goods/services using cryptocurrency, it flows counterclockwise in the diagram mentioned above.
The sub-process is the process of an exchanger (coin purchaser) changes fiat money into cryptocurrency,

it follows clockwise in the diagram above. Coordinated by LTXN, these two processes work collaboratively

to meet the demand in different case scenarios.
In the main process, an acquirer set a QR code or NFC equipment like Apple Pay at the merchant’s in
advance, a consumer will send a pay request through an App Wallet that is compatible with LITEX. The
request will be broadcasted to LTXN, and gets a pay route through the matching engine. The pay route will
deliver the consumer’s pay request to the best matched exchanger (into the sub-process), the exchanger
will pay fiat money to the merchant. The acquirer will send a code R to the exchanger once it confirms that
fiat money is received. The exchanger will get corresponding amount of cryptocurrency as soon as they
send the R code to LX'IN. In the end, R is sent back to the consumer through LTXN. Consumers then
verify code R and then send the cryptocurrency to the matching downstream node in LXTN. The entire

transaction process is then finished.
The system is designed with the following priorities:

1. Fund security

Ensuring the security of fund is the prerequisite of any off-chain transactions. An off-chain transaction
solution is viable only if it can eliminate the single point of failure risk brought by centralization. Based on
lightning network technology, LTXN ensures fund security through two types of smart contract: RSMC
and HTLC. When LITEX’s nodes are attacked, LIXN can automatically submit users’ funds to the main
chain for withdraw based on smart contracts after a certain period, the funds will return to users' digital

wallets safe and sound.

2. Payment and settlement experience

In micropayment case scenarios, consumers need the services/goods right away and the merchants need
to get the settlements quickly and smoothly. Due to cryptocurrency’s extremely high price volatility, if the
product is priced at cryptocurrency, both consumers and merchants will suffer from high fluctuation of
price. Users could input prices in fiat money on LITEX App, and determine the corresponding
ctyptocurrency price with the assistance of smart matching engine. Therefore, consumers only need to
know that they have paid a fiat currency price using cryptocurrency. At the merchant's end, merchants can
choose to settle with fiat money in real time. Therefore, their user experience is no different to other
traditional payment gateways (such as Visa), may even be better for because of less time and transaction

fee.

3. Exchange efficiency

The system provides corresponding product proposals to accommodate different exchange demands,
exchangers can choose a different option every time to fit his/her needs. If an exchanger’s demand for
ctyptocurrency exchange is not urgent (for example, they can wait for the cryptocurrency to arrive one day
or even one week later, and bear the volatility risk), the system can meet this demand with relatively low
service charge. If an exchanger has a very urgent demand, the system can also match the corresponding
order at a higher priority through matching engine, but the exchanger may need to pay a slightly higher

setvice fee.

——— pay channel ——> pay route

=———_ pay channel too thin to pass payment node reaches max traffic limit

The diagram above shows the routing of a transaction passing through LXT'N between a consumer and an

exchanger.

In the classic Lighting Network, each node by default maintains the records of a full node corresponding
to a ctyptocurrency. With HTLC's design, when a transaction passes through, all nodes in the payment

channel must proactively sign for the transaction.

However, in the real world, ordinary users can neither maintain a full node for small payments nor do they
have the bandwidth or will to manually sign each transaction that passes through their own channels. A
more realistic approach is that the users sign their payment through a mobile application (on a smartphone,
which cannot be a full node), and disconnect from the payment network until the next transaction is

initiated.

Since it is unrealistic to rely on ordinary users for passing transactions. LTXN designs a professional user
role — Node, it functions as the same as miners in other public chains, to relay transactions in a payment
route. Bitcoin miners earn mining incentives and transaction fees by recording transactions. Similarly,
Nodes in LTXN earn payment and exchange commissions by providing services such as maintaining full
nodes, establishing transaction channels, auto-signing, and maintaining nodes-online-rate. The Price Oracle

machine ensures that LX’T commissions are lower than other local exchanges.

To ensure Nodes’ stable service and reduce the centralization tendency, Nodes need to deposit a certain

number of Tokens via smart contracts ([oken design is explained in detail in section 7) to obtain the
corresponding amount of transaction processing rights. During the transaction process, tokens will
continue to be consumed, and then automatically distributed to consumers, exchangers and other ecological
parties by smart contracts. Since the number of Tokens pledged by Nodes are different, their ability to
process transactions are different. In the diagram above, the red Node cannot carry the transaction because
it reaches the upper limit of the transfer amount limited by the tokens it pledged, so it is bypassed by the

smart routing algorithm.

Based on RSMC, the payment channels have different upper limit, the differences are shown by distance
between the double-lines in the diagram. If the transaction amount exceeds the upper limit that can be
transmitted by the current channel, the path will be abandoned (it won’t become a route). In the diagram,
the red double-line indicates the channel that the transaction cannot pass because the amount exceeds the

limit.

To balance efficiency, stability, cost, and network topology, LTXN has many unique designs, the pledge
system and game strategy are just two of them. To optimize the process, we also think there is a need to
customize and optimize the BOLT protocol. We will articulate our detailed technical designs in the Yellow

Book.

5.3.1. Compound Decision Lightning Network
Lightning Network is a common name of distributed network based on BOLT protocol. The classic
lightning network can only accommodate off-chain point-to-point transaction and transfer of
cryptocurtrency, not any combination of crypto and fiat currency. LTXN designs and develops the "complex
decision lightning network", it aims to merge a decision network layer and lightning network layer into the
same distributed system, which can share the nodes and achieve more sophisticated routings. As a result,
the lightning network will be more intelligent. Advanced routing functions such as matching the exchange
requests and payment requests can be achieved. It also makes the whole network topology efficient and

reduce the nodes centralization tendency by design.

5.3.2. Matching Engine

Matching engine is the collection of a series of distributed intelligent algorithms, which is the most complex
core component of LTXN. The following example is based on a simple business case, it neither involves
the specific data structure nor discusses how the core strategy - "non-bank card payment business logic” is

applied to complex business processing to enhance system stability.

Suppose there are many payment requests and exchange requests in LIXN system at the same time.
Payment requests have relatively small amount and high urgency, while the exchange requests vary. To
enjoy lower exchange costs, some exchangers would accept an exchange to be done in a longer period of
time, they can even just set an upper limit to end the exchange at a specific time. Other exchangers, who
would like to obtain cryptocurrency immediately, can choose to pay a higher exchange service charge to
complete the exchange in a very short time. In real time, most exchanges fall somewhere in between, thus,

in the design, the time / cost ratio required by exchangers are somewhere between the ratios calculated in
the two situations mentioned above. We will find a way to quantify the preference of exchangers to serve

as the reference data for the matching engine.

In addition to time / cost matching for exchangers, the matching of the consumer-exchanger amount is
also very important. It is very common that the amount of an exchange request is much greater than that
of a payment request. LTXN needs to match multiple requests in the whole network to meet the
requirement so the Nodes form the optimal solution route. The factors that need to be considered include,
but are not limited to, currency type, amount, channel open time cost, channel usage cost. If the payment
demand is higher than the exchange demand, it could result in the amount of payment requests larger than
that of the exchange requests. In this situation, in addition to the above-mentioned factors, the timeliness
and cost of the mainnet should also be considered. If the amount is too big, consumers are advised to make

the payment through the mainnet.

Finally, the matching strategy also needs to consider the cost of connectivity. If the two parties of payment
and collection are in two separate disconnected networks (no known connected channels), the cost of
establishing cross-network channels needs to be considered. That part is discussed in the smart routing

section below.

5.3.3. Smart Routing

On-chain transaction is required for both the open and closure of a lightning network channel, which would
result in higher cost and longer time, resulting in no direct channel between a consumer and an exchanger
in most cases. The transaction is usually conducted through an intermediate node or multiple nodes that
are directly interconnected according to the HTLC contract. To find the shortest path (or path with the
lowest cost) quickly, each node of LTXN has a set of independent negotiation algorithm and the cache of
last synchronized node information, together they help to find the path and complete the transaction as

soon the demand is generated.

The payment channels must be closed for the withdraw operation in lightning network, which makes the
topology of the whole network keep changing all the time. On one hand, since the channels may be closed
ot opened at any time, some transactions may be denied accidentally if the original channel is closed, a new
channel needs to be found immediately. On the other hand, due to the different demands of payment, the
channel capacity (like the diameter of a tube) between nodes could also be different. In addition to the

consideration of the channel capacity in the initial routing phase, it may be necessary to split and merge

payment in a new process. This business logic requires what’s beyond the traditional routing algorithm, the

strategy and algorithm need to be further developed.

5.3.4. Light Node

Base on BOLT protocol, the lightning network nodes are designed as complete Bitcoin network nodes,

which means that users joining the network must maintain a complete data backup with a volume of dozens
of GB. But this is unrealistic in practice. LIXN nodes are designed based on Simplified Payment
Verification (SPV), only some part of the data records needed by business are added. This way, LTXN
nodes neither need to be a full node, nor to store all users' transactions in the whole network. It only needs
to store the related transactions over the channels where this node is part of. Once the channel is closed
and the transaction is confirmed in the main chain, the balance of the nodes at both ends of the channel
would be submitted to the main chain, at this point, users can choose to delete the previous transaction
data to optimize the storage space. The optimized LTXN nodes would not require too much storage space,

which could fully function on a smartphone.

5.3.5. Further Plan
To realize the design of LTXN and meet the demand for instant cryptocurrency micropayment, LITEX
Lab continues to dive deeper into the lightning network topology design to develop a more efficient routing

mechanism by improving the BOLT protocol.

At present, LITEX Lab is working on the preparation of the LITEX Yellow Paper (Technical White Paper).
With the continuous research and development, our technical solution will continue to improve, to ensure

a stable yet rapid development of the LITEX ecosystem.
6. The Use Case

In the classic use case of Alice use cryptocurrency to purchase a cup of coffee from Bob, the café owner,

let’s see the difference between scenarios with and without LITEX.
First, let’s discuss the use case scenatio without LITEX.

Alice only has Bitcoin and wants to buy a cup of coffee from Bob, who, on the other hand, is just an
ordinary businessman who does not know much about cryptocurrency technology and has no Bitcoins nor
crypto wallets. This means that Alice won’t be able to pay Bob unless she converts her Bitcoin into fiat
money. In this case scenario, Alice logs in to a cryptocurrency exchange to sell her Bitcoin, to get the fiat
money as soon as possible (Bob have started grinding coffee beans), she accepts a relatively lower price
and pays a relatively high transaction charge, and. since the transaction amount is small, the settlement time

could be as long as a few hours even if she sells her Bitcoin successfully. The coffee would be cold by then.

After the last failed try, Bob has learned something about Bitcoin. He starts to understand and appreciates
the concept of Bitcoin, but he does not want to bear the risk of price volatility by accepting Bitcoin payment.
To solve this problem, he signs up with a Bitcoin payment gateway, this way, when someone pays him
Bitcoin, what he receives in the end is fiat money exchanged by the payment processor. Things look much
more promising now. Meanwhile, Alice also learned a lesson (the mainnet transaction requires higher
service charge and longer time). She charges in advance with the payment gateway. The Bitcoin payment
experience is satisfactory, Alice gets her freshly made coffee. Bob logs in to the payment gateway application
to withdraw the $5 he just received. But it turns out that the payment gateway has raised the withdrawal
threshold to $100! Bob has to wait for the withdrawal when Alice buys 20 cups of coffee, which would take
at least 20 days---providing that Alice comes every day. On the 19th day, Bob finds out that the payment
gateway has lost a lot of Bitcoins and fiat currency because of a hacker attack and has declared bankruptcy
(single point of failure risk due to centralization). Consequently, the $95 he fails to withdraw is gone. Alice

also complains to Bob that the Bitcoins that she has not used is stolen by the hackers.

Now let us introduce LITEX into this use case, illustrate the smooth and secure payment experience

brought by a decentralized payment network.

Bob suffered a loss, but he has not given up on Bitcoin. He was introduced to LITEX, a brand-new
solution. The installation process is the same as other payment gateways (such as Visa), it has gone
smoothly. Bob tells Alice that he can accept Bitcoin payment again. After another lesson learned, Alice has
also become a LITEX user and sets up her own payment channel to avoid the risk brought by centralization.
She opens LITEX's App and scans Bob's receipt QR code, and then directly inputs $5 in fiat money, clicks
‘Pay’, one second later, Bob's cashier App asks him to confirm a $5 of payment. After clicking the
confirmation button, Bob finds that the $5 has entered directly in his account. Alice's phone also alerts her

that the payment has completed and the Bitcoin equivalent to $5 has been deducted from the channel
balance with no service charge. With the help of LITEX, Alice buys a cup of coffee easily with Bitcoin and
pays no service charge; Bob, on the other side, receives the fiat money converted from Bitcoin immediately.
He finally can accept Bitcoin payments. Even if LITEX is attacked and some nodes are lost, other nodes
via established LTXN can still fulfill Alice's payment demand; even if most nodes are damaged and the

transaction fails to be executed, both Alice and Bob's existing funds ate still intact.
7. Token Design

7.1. Name and Purpose

As an ecosystem built with many parties, LITEX needs a series of incentive strategies to redistribute the
values generated by the ecosystem to all the participants to ensure a healthy operation and to stimulate

rapid development. LITEX has designed an encrypted token, LITEX Token (LXT as symbol) to carry this

function.

7.2. LXT System

7.2.1. Generation and Annihilation of LXT

LXT is generated based on ERC20 standard of Ethereum Smart Contract with the total number of 2 billion
(2,000,000,000). It is configured by the system only once. There will never be additional issuance and LXT

has no annihilation mechanism.

7.2.2. Supply and Demand

Supply: LXT is dropped to consumers, exchangers and other participating parties in the ecosystem

according to the transaction amount.

Demand

- Nodes pledge certain amount of LXT to the LXN system to obtain the corresponding volume of
management rights. The LXN system continuously supplements the consumption of LXT in the

transaction process, and consumes patt of it as a source of supply
- Users who uses LXT get discount (transaction fee discount or free of charge)

The above diagram approximately illustrates the flow of LXT in the ecosystem. The data is for illustration

purposes only and does not represent actual values.
The transaction fees, LXT consumption and the proportion of drops will vary in each country and region
due to the difference of local legislative and regulatory requirements (tax laws etc.) and other operational

factors such as the parameters provided by the price oracle machine.

As an ERC20 Token, LXT is bound to incur costs in during the distribution process, however as a system

with positive returns, LITEX can fully bear this cost, and further reduce costs through proper design.

10. Risk Statement

10.1. Risk Warning

Litex Foundation believes that there are many risks in the process of LITEX’s development, maintenance
and operation, most of which will exceed the control of Litex Foundation. Each LXT token participator
shall read carefully, understand and consider the following risks, then determine prudently whether to
participate in the token exchange program. Once involved in the program, participants will be deemed to

have had full knowledge of the following risks and agreed to take them.

e Risks of legal policy and regulation

Encrypted tokens are being or may be supervised by competent authorities of different countries. In
different countries, LXT is likely to be defined as virtual good, digital property, or even security and
currency at any time. Therefore, in some countries, according to the local supervision requirements, Litex
Foundation may be ordered to suspend or end all token exchange programs. If the competent authorities
adopt relevant regulations, the development, marketing, advertising and other aspects of the LITEX are

potentially badly affected, hindered and ended. For the regulatory policy is changeable at any time, existing

regulatory approval and tolerance of LITEX or the open sell plans in any country are temporary. If this
LXT public exchange program is canceled in advance, only part of the amount paid will be refunded to

holders due to the fluctuation of the tokens price and the expenditure of Litex Foundation.

e Risks of team and project

Currently, there are many teams and projects in the field of blockchain technology, making the market
competition rather intensified and the project operation pressured. Whether the LITEX project is capable
of standing out among other excellent ones and widely recognized, it is not only related to its team capability
and vision planning, but is also affected by the market competition, including the probable vicious one.
Core members of the LITEX community has many years of technological accumulation in the insurance
industry and blockchain, which can help to rally more talents in blockchain and insurance industry to join
the community, but it can’t rule out the possibility that the overall project will be negatively affected due to

the leaving of core members and internal conflicts.

e Risks of Technology
Computer technology is keeping developing, and cryptography is in constantly progressing. There is no
guarantee on absolute security at any time, which may lead to stolen, lost, destroyed, or devalued of LXT

of the holders.

Although Litex Foundation will try to protect the security of the LITEX network, it does not guarantee

that LITEX has no weakness or authority. While any person may intentionally or unintentionally take
weakness ot defect into LITEX’s core infrastructure factors, Litex Foundation cannot solve these

weaknesses or defects by taking safety measures to prevent or make up.

This may eventually lead to the loss of participant’s LITEX or other crypto tokens. In addition, LITEX's
source code may have some flaws, errors, defects, and vulnerabilities, which may prevent users from using
specific features, expose users’ information or create other problems. If such a defect exists, it will damage
LITEX's usability, stability and security, and thus adversely affect the value of LITEX. Transparency is the

basis of the open source code, to promote the identification and problem solving of code in the community.

The LITEX foundation will work closely with the LITEX community for the continuous improvement,
optimization and perfection of LITEX's source code. The rapid development of LITEX will be

accompanied by sharp increase in transaction and demand for processing capacity. If the demand for

processing capacity exceeds the load provided by the nodes in the network, the LITEX network may be

paralyzed or stagnant, and may produce wrong transaction.

In the worst-case scenario, anyone’s LXT may lose. This will damage LITEX's usability, stability and
security, and the value of LXT. In addition, LITEX is still in the development stage. Due to the technical
complexity of LITEX system, the Litex Foundation may sometimes face difficulties that cannot be
predicted or overcome. Therefore, the development of LITEX may fail or be given up at any time for any
reason (e.g., lack of funds). Failure to develop or waiving will cause LXT unable to deliver to the participants

in this exchange plan.

e Risks of Security

The external attack may bring negative effects, stagnation, paralysis, and even calculation error to the
LITEX system, thus leading to the delay of transaction and even temporary failure to perform, and it may
also lead to the error, breakdown and missing of data, damage the availability, reliability and security of
LITEX and the value of LXT. In addition, there may someone attempted to steal the funds from public
sales of the LITEX foundation (including the parts that have been converted into legal currency). Such

theft or attempt of theft might affect the LITEX foundation's ability to fund LXT's development. Although

the LITEX foundation will take measures to protect the safety of crowdfunding, theft is still hard to stop.

e Other possible risks.

oO The tisk of source code upgrade
LITEX's source code is open and may be updated, modified, or modified by any member of the LITEX
community from time to time. No one can predict or guarantee the exact result of an upgrade, amendment,
modification or change. Therefore, any updating, correction, modification, or change may result in
unforeseen or unintended consequences, which will have a significant negative impact on the operation of

LITEX ot the value of LXT.

oO. The tisk of unauthorized claim of LXT
Any person who has access to registered email or registered account by decrypting or decrypting LXT
holder's password will be able to maliciously obtain the LXT token of the LXT holder. Accordingly, holder's
LXT token may be sent to the LXT address of someone else, which is irrevocable and irreversible. Each
LXT holder shall take measures such as the following to properly maintain the security of his/her registered

email or account: (i) use complex and high security password; (ii) do not open or reply to any fraudulent

mail; (iii) strictly keep secret from personal information and other related security measures.

o- Market risk
The value of LXT is largely determined by the market development and uset’s acceptance of the LITEX

platform. LITEX is not expected to be popular or be widely used within a short period of time. In the

worst-case scenario, LITEX may even be marginalized over a long term, attracting only a small number of

users. In contrast, a large part of the LXT demand may be speculative. The lack of users may lead to the

increase of price fluctuation in LXT market, which will affect the long-term development of LITEX. When
such price fluctuation occurs, LITEX does not have the responsibility to stabilize or influence the market

ptice of LXT.

© Liquidity risk
LXT is not a currency issued by any individual, entity, central bank or national organization, and it does
not have any hard asset or gets support from other credit. LXT's circulation and trading in the market is
not the responsibility or pursuit of the Litex Foundation. LXT transaction is based only on the consensus
reached by relevant market participants on their value. No one is obligated to exchange any LXT from
LXT holders, and no one can guarantee the liquidity or market price of LXT at any time. If LXT holders
want to transfer LXT, they need to find one or several interested persons to exchange. The process can be
costly, time-consuming and ultimately unsuccessful. In addition, there may be no encrypted token exchange

or other market LXT for public transactions.

© Risk of price fluctuation
When trading in an open market, the price of encrypted tokens usually fluctuates wildly. Price shocks often
occur in short term. The price is likely to be calculated in Bitcoins, ether, dollars, or other legal currencies.
Such price fluctuation may be caused by market forces (including speculation), regulatory policy changes,
technological innovation, availability of exchanges and other objective factors, which also reflects the
changes in the balance between supply and demand. Whether there is a secondary market for the LXT
transaction or not, the Litex Foundation does not take responsibility for LXT transaction of any secondary
market and does not have the obligation to stabilize the price fluctuation of LXT, and it does not care about

it. LXT traders shall bear the risk involved in the LXT transaction price.

© Competition risk
The underlying protocol of or LITEX is based on open source computer software. No one claims copyright

or other intellectual property rights to the source code. Therefore, any person can legally copy, remake,
design, modify, upgrade and improve, recode, reprogram or use LITEX source or the underlying protocol
in otherwise ways to develop competitive protocol, software, system, virtual platform, virtual machine or
smart to compete with LITEX contract, or even surpass or replace LITEX, which cannot be controlled by
the Litex Foundation. The Litex Foundation is unlikely to eliminate, prevent, limit or reduce such

competitive efforts aimed at competing with LITEX or replacing LITEX under any circumstances.

oO Risk of insufficient information disclosure
By the publication date of this white paper, LITEX is still in the development stage, whose technical details
and parameters such as philosophy, consensus mechanism, algorithm and code may be updated and
changed frequently. Although this white paper contains the latest key information of LITEX, it is not
absolutely complete and will still be adjusted and updated from time to time by Litex Foundation for
specific purposes. Litex Foundation has no ability no obligation at any time to inform participants of

LITEX development in every detail (including its progress and expected milestone, whether delay or not),

so it will make the holder fail to be timely and fully exposed to the new information of Litex Foundation.

The sufficiency of information disclosure is avoidable and reasonable.

10.2. Disclaimer

This white paper is for informational transmission only, and the contents of this document are for reference

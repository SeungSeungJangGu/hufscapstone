Introduction

The main reason for innovating and developing cryptocurrencies is
making international financial payments and transfers easier and faster.
All development and growth process of cryptocurrency technology was
to break the monopoly of big financial companies with huge
commissions for transferring fiat cryptocurrencies around the world.
However, by increasing the demand for buying major cryptocurrencies
in the global market such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple, the price of
all these cryptocurrencies experienced a sudden great increase, although
this growing process faced a downward trend in late 2018. The price of
all cryptocurrencies dropped sharply. It raised many suspicions among
economic analysts. Can we be assured that the cryptocurrencies are con-
sistent with their primary purposes? And are they still able to be applied
as a safe method for financial transfers? Above all else, the major
principle in financial transfers is guaranteeing value stability of various
cryptocurrencies.

Fortunately, there have been created many alternatives in this regard.
Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies with a stable and fixed rate equal to that
of fiat currencies and other currencies in different countries around the
world. Various mechanisms like guaranteeing bank assets or global
securities are used to fix Stablecoins’ price.

It is certain that Stablecoins are the future of global financial markets.
Entrepreneur website considers the future of cryptocurrencies entailing
Stablecoins’ development. In fact, Stablecoins can remove all the worries
in financial transfers through cryptocurrencies.

Moreover, the other important issue in cryptocurrencies was the lack of
sufficient security in converting cryptocurrencies to each other and
developing safe wallets. It is estimated that just in 2018, more than 800
million dollars of the people's digital assets have been destroyed only
due to lack of security in cryptocurrencies exchange services.

New strategies in the field of combining Stablecoins technology and
increasing cryptocurrencies safety factor besides different financial
services can solve the problems of cryptocurrencies.

Escrow

Escrow is a legal concept wherein a financial tool or asset is kept by a
third party instead of the first or second parties of an ongoing
transaction; in other words, when using escrow, the third party acts as
an official guarantor and warrantor. The money to be transferred or
assets are kept by the escrow agency. This agency controls the entire
trade and transaction process and ensures that needed commitments
have been observed. Therefore, no one can use his/her money without
the agreement of other participants. In Counos escrow service,
cryptocurrencies are used as the unit of buying, selling, and financial
transaction.

While one key feature of cryptocurrencies is to protect people’s private
data, and payments done via cryptocurrencies are irreversible, if we
want to use them in financial transactions related to all kinds of trades,
some methods should be offered to assure the parties of a trade in order
to manage the process of confirmations and disagreements between the
parties.

Counos Escrow service has been created with this aim. Using this
service, you can invite your trade counterpart to the system, create a
contract, and make the payment securely in the form of methods that
Blockchain has provided for you. In Counos escrow service there is a
structure that by using forecasted facilities in Blockchain technology,
provides adequate security for the parties of a transaction.

Buyer, seller, and Escrow service provider create a new shared wallet
with their own private key. This new wallet, which is created using
multisig capability, will only allow the withdrawal of its balance when at
least two out of three of its creators confirm the outgoing transaction.

In fact, in the shared wallet, three signatures are created, and the entire
trade fee will be deposited to this wallet. If the buyer and the seller come
to terms about transferring the balance, the cost will be transferred to the
seller’s account without the need for the Escrow system.

Introduction

Substratum is creating an open-source foundation for a decentralized web which will
provide unrestricted access to content and sharing of information for users across the
globe. Our mission is to bring forth the free and fair internet of the future by combining
proven technological building blocks with emergent technologies in an innovative and

holistic way to help solve many of the problems that plague the modern internet.

Substratum will gain mass adoption by revolutionizing the hosting industry with per-
request billing via micro-transactions and incentivizing users to run nodes to create the
network by paying node hosts in Substrate. This is all being managed by blockchain

technology and machine learning.

THE DECENTRALIZED WEB

Current Internet and Issues at Play

The current version of the web, how we currently experience the internet has become
increasingly centralized, censored and faced many controls. Data must travel through
designated hardware access points (usually servers and hubs). This causes access
points to become hacking targets to anyone seeking user’s personal data. Aside from
cybersecurity issues, there is also the issue of net neutrality. Net neutrality is the idea
that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) should not be allowed to slow service to specific

sites, or be able to block content and applications that flow through that network.
“Just afew large platforms drive most traffic to online news sources in the U.S., and
thus have enormous influence over what sources of information the public consumes
ona daily basis. The existence of these consolidated points of control is troubling for
many reasons. Asmall number of stakeholders end up having outsized influence over
the content the public can create and consume. This leads to problems ranging from
censorship at the behest of national governments to more subtle, perhaps even
unintentional, bias in the curation of content users see based on opaque, unaudited
curation algorithms. The platforms that host our networked public sphere and inform
us about the world are unelected, unaccountable, and often impossible to audit or

oversee.”

The Decentralized Web

The decentralized web (or Web 3.0) isa web controlled by independent and privately
owned computers that allow for a web experience that is both secure and open. This
means that everyone can access all information and services on the internet without
informational gatekeepers, ISP interference as well as being resistant to corporate or

governmental surveillance and restrictions.

A decentralized web will create a free and open web for everyone in the world by
making sure that anyone in the world can access content with no interference from
corporations or governmental agencies. When net neutrality, data breaches and
cybersecurity are growing concerns to the general public, the call fora community-

oriented web experience is now stronger than ever.

THE SUBSTRATUM NETWORK

The Substratum Network combines innovative technologies from the cryptocurrency,
and community hosting realms to not only usher ina free, peer-to-peer internet, but to
revolutionize the hosting industry. The Substratum Network is made up of nodes—
networks of peer-to-peer computers—who then can deliver secure content anywhere
using industry-leading cryptography, effectively ending the need for VPNs and Tor. It
changes web hosting by incentivizing network users with its own cryptocurrency token
to essentially rent out their unused computing resources as a hosting platform for
websites. Hosting costs are billed through per-request micro-transactions, inhibiting

the payment of unutilized resources.

One of the biggest frustrations of the decentralized web and its users is that it isn’t
always easy for those who aren't technically inclined. Part of the beauty of the
Substratum Network is that you don’t need any additional software or a special
browser to run it. The network integrates into existing internet frameworks, meaning

the end user won’t have to change the ways in which they interact with the web.

Substratum provides a method for serving decentralized content through a Mac,
Windows, and Linux application service that is easy to install and run (requires no
technical expertise) and serves up decentralized content using the toolkit that we have

developed.

By allowing millions of Substratum Network users to serve content the biggest concern
becomes privacy and security. Substratum solves these issues through advanced

cryptography algorithms rooted in Artificial Intelligence that ensures all data remains
secure. Following the lead of BitCoin, this is the strength of cryptocurrency and the

crypto movement.

Substratum will become a fully open-sourced project upon launching version 2 in the
beginning of 2018. This means that the source code will be available to anyone for
redistribution or modification. The reason we are waiting, is to ensure our compression

and cryptographic algorithms are solid before we take the project open-source.

The Substratum Network will provide an API and SDK for developing tools and
applications directly on the Substratum Platform. Adding this feature allows fora
strong developer presence and an extensive support network while simultaneously

accelerating the growth of the decentralized web on the Substratum Network.
Section 3

SUBSTRATUM HOST

The SubstratumHost component of the networkSubstratum will completely change
the ways that we approach web hosting. Currently, web hosting consists of payinga
company to store a website’s files on aserver connected to the internet. Pricing is
typically structured around first buying a domain name (for example: http://
www.substratum.net is a domain name). Then, a monthly price is set based on how
much bandwidth and computing resources you need to run the site. For small, personal
websites shared hosting—sharing space ona server with other sites— will usually
suffice. For businesses and larger enterprises with a complex site and alot of traffic
must use either VPS (Virtual Private Servers) or cloud hosting. VPS hosting involves
paying a hosting company for dedicated use to their servers whereas cloud hosting
such as AWS (Amazon Web Services) involves only renting the space you needona

|?

“virtual” server instead of a paying to use physical one.

The primary issue with web hosting in its current form is that is incredibly expensive! It
can cost upwards thousands of dollars per month solely to host the site files—this
doesn’t include any maintenance costs or additional security. This makes it incredibly
difficult for small or medium sized businesses to have astrong web presence without

incurring significant costs.

Other less prevalent issues include alack of transparency regarding uptime (the time a
hosting company can guarantee a site to be online), the need for additional software,
lack of reliable security, slow load times based on server location as wellas privacy and
resource limitations (CPU, RAM, etc.).

Substratum aims to resolve these common issues in the following ways:
1. Drastically reducing hosting costs through peer-to-peer hosting that is billed per request through

micro-transactions. This means that you will only be billed when people go to your site as opposed

to per minute or hour like AWS and other cloud hosting platforms.

¢ Aseach request comes through the amount of CPU power, Network Bandwidth and the

amount of dataare calculated

and once athreshold of 1 ATOM is reached a micro-

transaction will take place between the HOST and the NODE and Substrate will be

transferred. The result of allo

abases and applications, the Substratum Network uses

advanced compression algorithms, geolocation and machine learning to direct the right

combination of Substratum Network nodes to serve content to the intended user based on

location. This will ensure the fastest

load times with the lowest amount of latency/strain onthe

Substratum Network, the serving machine and the receiving machine.

3. Due to Substratum’s peer-to-peer network, websites will never experience downtime.

4. Weserve Substratum Requests directly to the default browser (Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Internet

Explorer) without any special software installed on the average consuming users computer.

5. Substratum uses cryptography, compression algorithms and the peer-to-peer network itself to

send data in small, encrypted pieces

7. Substratum hosts sites that can bea

8. SubstratumHost will have an easy to use Control Panel similar to CPanel or PHPMyAdmin that will

allow you to manage your content as a web host.

Upon launch, Substratum will support the following languages and libraries:
* HTML/CSS
* JavaScript (jQuery, Bootstrap)
¢ PHP/MySQL (Wordpress, Magento, Joomla)
« ASP.NET
« Python (Django)

More will be added in future versions such as Ruby/Ruby on Rails.

Section 4

SUBSTRATUM NODE

SubstratumNode is the actual network of computers that link all of Substratum’s
interactions. It will allow anyone to become aweb host and earn Substratum’s own
cryptocurrency while the user is hosting. Users do not need any Substrate Tokens to
runaSubstratumNode. They only need avalid Substrate Wallet Address (supported

through Ethereum) to send your Substrate at your designated payout periods.

Through an easy-to-use, Ul interface the user can easily control how much CPU, GPU
and RAM they want to let Substratum use. The user can control what times and days of
the week they want to allow hosting. This allows your node makes the most money
possible for you when you aren’t working but doesn’t disturb you when you are

working.

Network Members that run our broadcast software will receive SUB coins by serving

requests. This increases global participation and will bring value to Substrate.

In order to run SubstratumNode on your computer, users only need to have ports 80

(HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) open to run anode. These ports will automatically be opened
inthe setup process. The Substratum host will be simple to setup and run.
SubstratumDNS

DNS (Domain Name System): DNS or the Domain Name System is the naming system
that currently tells your browser where to go when you type ina domain name. For
instance when someone types http://www.substratum.net into the address bar,a DNS
lookup is performed to check where to send the request. Then the DNS system returns
aunique IP address where the request can be routed. The first version of
SubstratumDNS will be a complex, Al enabled DNS server that will receive DNS
requests along with the geolocation of the requestor and find the closest available

SubstratumNode able to fulfill the request.

SubstratumDNS runs on both the distributed and decentralized web through asystem
bridge. It uses the existing DNS framework of the internet to deliver content to default
browsers and allows the user to keep their domain name; however, that is where the
similarities with a traditional DNS server end. The most substantial difference lies in its
process of receiving requests from the user and returning the requested page back to

the user.

1. SubstratumDNS prioritizes the user’s geolocation to identify the closest nodes. This allows for the

user to receive the fastest request response possible.

2. Within that bank of nodes, the system locates the node(s) with the most accurate
information that needs to be returned. This isa complex process involving machine

learning and advanced algorithms.

Note: Not al/ nodes hold the same information. In fact, the nodes themselves rotate content and

information to guarantee and maintain their anonymity.

3. Once the system locates the best primary node it sends the request to the node to return to the

user.
4. lf the node requires additional content from another node, the two nodes will work in

tandem to return the required content.

This will ensure that we can reach the entire world with the Substratum network
without the average everyday user having to install any special software.

SUBSTRATUM COINS AND CRYPTO PAY

Substrate Token

“Cryptocurrency” and “blockchains” are terms that have been tossed around the past

few years without a lot of information on what they actually are and how they work.

Put simply, cryptocurrencies are e-monies that are not backed by any centralized
financial institute or financial server. Instead it is backed and produced from within the
cryptocurrency community itself. This means that every single peerina
cryptocurrency’s network has alist of all transactions made by all other peers. This
database of the networks data and transactions is called the blockchain. In order to
complete atransaction, the entire network has to collectively agree that the
transaction is valid and that there are available funds to move. A transaction is simply a
file that tells the network what you want to do, signed with your personal, encrypted
key. This file is broadcasted to the entire network through nodes (a network of peer-to-
peer computers). Once the transaction is confirmed as legitimate, the record of the
transaction is added as anew block to the blockchain. This record cannot be changed,

reversed or altered in any way.

Blockchain technology is being used for more than digital money. Due to its genuine
peer-to-peer network, it can be used for identity confirmation, smart contracts,
auditing, dataand record management. The applications that are using blockchain

technology are growing and changing every day.
Substratum Network will be running a combination of blockchains, developed
specifically for the decentralized web. Substrate, the coin that is the fuel that runs the

Substratum Network is aERC20 compliant token based on the Ethereum Blockchain.

Substratum runs on Substrate and Atoms, a rough linguistic equivalent to dollars and
cents. The fiat currency model uses numbers rounded to the second decimal place, and
so does SUB. The numbers before the decimal point are Substrate and the numbers

after are the Atoms. So for example, 354.98 SUB equals 354 Substrate and 98 Atoms.

In order to incentivize users to run the Substratum Network client on their machine,
Substrate will be used as payment for serving the network. The coin is issued to the
serving machine through a micro-transaction from the hosting site to the serving
computer. By breaking fees down to a micro-transactional level it greatly reduces the
overall cost to companies and entities that want to host sites and applications on the

internet as they pay only for what is being used.

Creating and Maintaining Substrate’s Value in the Global Market

Substrate acts as the fuel that powers the Substratum Network*. The process works

something like this:

1. Whenabusiness or entity wants to host their site(s) on the decentralized web, they will purchase

Substrate using other cryptocurrencies or fiat.

2. WhenaSubstratum Network member runs their node and renders requests they are paid using

Substrate from the host.

3. Whenashopper checks out using CryptoPay, the payment method they use is converted to the

payment method the vendor desires by using Substrate as the conversion currency.
* Should the market ever reach 90% saturation, the network will create 10% additional tokens and
separate them into an account that is only used to fuel the network. These will not hit the exchanges

and will only be available for transactions within the network.

* To ensure the development fund is not subject to big market fluctuations, we’re hedging it four
ways. By doing this we ensure we have the capital needed to finish each phase of the project
budgeted for in the Initial Coin Offering (ICO).

CryptoPay

CryptoPay is an online wallet that allows storage, transfer and spending capabilities for
GBP, USD, EUR, BTC. We will be bringing in CryptoPay to support Substrate (SUB). This
will allowall sites and applications that run on the Substratum Network to process

cryptocurrency transactions using any publicly traded coin.

web users

Development Tools for the Decentralized Web: the Substratum Network will provide
an API and SDK for developing tools on the Substratum Platform. This will bring in
strong developer support and will accelerate the growth of the decentralized web on

the Substratum Network.

With the Substratum Network ALL web-sites and applications will have EQUAL ability
to be broadcast in an equal and fair manner. International Digital Barriers: currently
countries like China have strict regulations on what their 1.379 billion citizens are able to
interact with on the internet. Substratum will break down these barriers through a
network of decentralized computers running the Substratum Network Software.
Where other solutions that are currently used by residents in these countries require
special software to be installed, like TOR, Substratum will take a reverse approach and

require no special software for the average user.

The benefits of the decentralized web are clear and the proponents are of the highest
caliber in the technological community but not without its issues. Substratum aims to
solve global issues of censorship, international content barriers, full net neutralityanda

user-governed ethics system.

On the Substratum Network, ALL websites and applications will have equal ability to
broadcast content, but with the added self-governing element means that users will
have asystem of self-governance so illegal content like child pornography and
terrorism sites can eventually be removed from the network while keeping the integrity

and openness of the network free and fair for all.

ICO Goals

Substratum solves a global problem that all experts agree is the next step in the
evolution of the internet. In version 2, we integrate all Cryptocurrencies that are
publicly traded into a Payment Gateway that brings all cryptocurrencies to the web and
uses Substratum Coin as an exchange currency which brings tremendous value. In
order to achieve these goals we need to raise working capital for further development
to take us through version 2 and marketing capital to raise awareness about our
product. Substratum builds upon principles of the crypto community and takes
decentralization to the next logical step in the progression that BitCoin started.
Because Substratum is inthe same sphere of influence cryptocurrency investors
should find this project appealing and the overall reach of this project goes even
beyond that of BitCoin and Cryptocurrencies in general. In 10 years Substratum should

touch every computer on the planet.

ICO Budget Allocation

Product Awareness: 30% of Total Budget

Regardless of how great the project is no one will use it if they don’t know aboutit.
Because of that we will be spending a considerable amount of resources on raising
awareness of the product. This will involve traditional methods of advertising as well as
taking part in cryptocurrency/blockchain-based conferences worldwide as speakers

and booth vendors.

Product Development: 60% of Total Budget
The core of the budget is the development of the product, so naturally the majority of
the budget is allocated to development. Through the use of our core team and by

bringing in additional resources we will achieve the product timeline set in place.

Network Infrastructure: 10% of Total Budget
To kick-start the network we will need to establish data centers around the world to

provide the core supernodes.
Section &

US PARTICIPATION

The Securities and Exchange Commission recently made a filing that most coins need
to be registered as acommodity to runan ICO for US citizens. The exception to that
rule is if the token/coin has a purpose as part of a platform or system. If itis used as the
FUEL that runs the system. Since Substrate is the fuel that runs the Substratum

Network, we are cleared to run for US Citizens.

THE FUTURE OF SUBSTRATUM

Beta

A public beta will be released during December of 2017.

Version1

SubstratumNode — Mac, Windows, Linux Software for Substratum Network Users to
run their Web, Database, and App Broadcast Nodes and receive Substratum Coin ona

per request basis.

Developer Toolkit — for Developers to write applications to run onthe Substratum
Network which includes our fully encrypted SubstratumDB (Database Management
System), SubstratumWeb (Web Application Server), and SubstratumApp (App

Development System and Broadcast Server).
SubstratumStore — Decentralized app store for developers to submit their

applications to that will serve as the application store for the decentralized web.

SubstratumDNS — This isa DNS (Domain Name Management) system bridge that will
allow standard browsers on any system (Mac, Windows, Linux) to use their default
browser (Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer) to serve up sites from the
Substratum Network. This will ensure that we can reach the entire world with the
Substratum network without the average everyday user having to install any special

software.

Version 2 (Early to Mid 2018)

Payment Gateway (SubstratumPay) to the Substratum Network. This will enable not
only Credit Card transactions but CryptoCurrency transactions for all websites and

applications on the Substratum Network.

SubstratumBridge will provide the crux of the SubstratumPay network by using
SubstratumCoin as a bridge coin for all transactions that happen on our Payment
Gateway network. For example if a user wants to pay with LiteCoin we will execute a
micro-transaction that will convert BitCoin into SubstratumCoin which will then pay
the vendor in Fiat. This conversion will happen seamlessly in the background and will

further provide value to the SubstratumCoin.

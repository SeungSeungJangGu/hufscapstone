MWC Team's Mission

What does good digital money look like? Good money in the Information Age is scarce,
censorship resistant, extensible, durable, indestructible, salable, portable, fungible, private
and divisible. Good money.

The mission of the MWC developer team is to match and exceed every other good in the
market with regard to these ten monetary characteristics in order to produce a good that is
the superior qualitative money.

In order to most effectively harness the power of human action, all aspects of the MWC
monetary product from creation to distribution and development will hold as the primary
purpose or aim to establish greater monetary sovereignty for the buyers and holders in the
least costly and most profitable way.

Summary

Bitcoin set the standard of what digital money could be, but, unfortunately lacks a few of
the key characteristics of good money. Released seven years after Bitcoin, MimbleWimble
technology was created to solve these privacy and fungibility deficiencies while also
providing greater network scalability.

All MWC transactions on the base layer use Greg Maxwell's CoinJoin with his Confidential
Transactions and signature aggregation. Therefore, all transactions keep all data about the
sender, receiver and amount private and each MWC is fungible because it does not have a
unique transaction history recorded on a public ledger like legacy blockchain technology
does.
In the 2018 paper titled Aggregate Cash System: A Cryptographic Investigation of
Mimblewimble, Fuchsbauer, et. al. concluded, "In this paper, we provide a provable-
security analysis for Mimblewimble. We give a precise syntax and formal security
definitions for an abstraction of Mimblewimble that we call an aggregate cash system. We
then formally prove the security of Mimblewimble in this definitional framework. Our results
imply in particular that two natural instantiations (with Pedersen commitments and Schnorr
or BLS signatures) are provably secure against inflation and coin theft under standard
assumptions.”

The MWC development team seeks to innovate both technologically and economically in
order to bring out all of the MimbleWimble protocol benefits. The MWC team has already
created a fully functional GUI wallet, developed a method for secure offline cold storage of
MWC, completed a MWC/BTC atomic swap on testnet and is investigating the
development of a mobile node.

There are many potential places development resources can be allocated. They will be
chosen based on market needs. Highest priority will be given to requests that primarily
benefit and come from the buyers and holders of last resort.

While the MWC Team will carefully consider all opinions; they realize the most important
arbiter of success for this monetary product will be the aggregated decisions of the market
as found in the orderbook.

The MWC network was launched in November 2019 and has functioned flawlessly with
100% uptime.

MimbleWimble: Disruptive Innovation

On July 19th, 2016 the pseudonymous “Tom Elvis Jedusor” rocked the Bitcoin developer
community by releasing the “MimbleWimble” white paper which proposed a blockchain
architecture with several significant advantages over Bitcoin.

Andrew Poelstra's 2016 San Fran BitDevs presentation on Mimblewimble sent
shockwaves through the Bitcoin developer community. Mimblewimble provides an
approximate 3x scalability improvement over legacy blockchain technology plus other
benefits.

Unfortunately, incorporating Mimblewimble into Bitcoin would be a difficult and invasive
task as it may require a hard fork. Alternatively, it may be incorporated into Bitcoin as a
sidechain or extension blocks.

Three main properties of MWC transactions increase their privacy. All transactions on the
base layer are CoinJoined with Confidential Transactions and signature aggregation.
Consequently, there are no addresses, transaction amounts or intermediary inputs and
outputs in blocks and all transactions are indistinguishable from one another. Unless you
are a transaction participant then all inputs and outputs look like random pieces of data on
the blockchain.

In 2016 Bitcoin Core developer Peter Wuille said,

Introducing Mimblewimble into Bitcoin in a backwards-compatible way would be a difficult
exercise. It may not be impossible, but it would be hard. | think the way if people were
experimenting with this, | would expect it to be an experimental separate chain or
sidechain. In a sidechain we would not introduce a new cryptocurrency but it would be a
separate chain. There are some downsides to Mimblewimble. In particular, it does not
have a scripting language...a scripting language is very neat to play with, but it has a
privacy downside. Mimblewimble takes this to the other side where you have very good
privacy but at the expense of no other features any more.

Fortunately, there has been significant research done since then and with Mimblewimble
these types of smart contracts and applications are possible: Multi-Signature transactions,
time locks, atomic swaps, and hashed time-locked contracts which are the building block
of payment channels and Lightning Network.

MWC: Alpha Stage

The MWC project was announced in February 2019 with an airdrop to Bitcoin holders.
Registration took place between April 20, 2019 and July 19, 2019. More than 148,000 BTC
registered in thousands of addresses with a value greater than $1.2B. The MWC airdrop
was one of the most anticipated and largest airdrops ever.

MWC mainnet launched in November 2019. In the genesis block, 10,000,000 MWC were
created to establish the initial stock.

In December 2019 MWC, about 5,400,000 of 6,000,000 MWC were claimed and
distributed to BTC airdrop recipients. This method was chosen to result in having a highly
sophisticated self-selected user base with significant financial resources.

Affirmative action was required to claim and there was a deadline strictly imposed.

Consequently, a large base of highly sophisticated, economically incentivized and
financially powerful holders could be quickly amassed without large inflationary costs
incurred by buyers like with Bitcoin, and, unlike Bitcoin Cash and other forks there would
be no significant supply overhang from initially uninterested or hostile parties. The airdrop
recipients freely received a hedge against Mimblewimble technology.

The creation of the initial stock did not necessarily create any material value. Like with
gold, Bitcoin and every other financially substantive asset, the market capitalization would
need to be attained through the market process of buyers and sellers. The airdrop
distribution began on December 2, 2019 with a total value of less than $1.35m at about
$0.00-0.25 per MWC. There was anticipation that some airdrop recipients would sell their
freely received MWC. Trading data from Hotbit, the sole exchange listing MWC, from
December to February showed millions of MWC of volume with wildly fluctuating prices.

MWC: Beta Stage

In early April 2020, MWC went through a phase transition with the successful deployment
of a hard fork. This resulted in two major changes: (1) a proof of work change so that
around November 2020 MWC would solely use the C31 algorithm and (2) an emission rate
change.

The MWC HODL Program is a financial innovation designed as a security feature and to
further lessen the economic costs of buyers and holders. On October 26, 2020 ALL
remaining funds have been distributed and the initial stock has been fully distributed to
MWC hodlers.

The primary purpose of the HODL Program was to act as a very important check and
balance on the possibility of a hidden inflation bug being abused. This would manifest itself
as more MWC being registered than are supposed to exist under the consensus rules.

For example, if someone were able to find and abuse a hidden inflation bug and then

attempt to financially profit by selling on an exchange then it is likely that, eventually, a
buyer would withdraw the coins and register them in the HODL Program. Because the
GRIN supply is created solely through mining, therefore, it is not possible to check for
hidden inflation using this type of economic incentive.
MWC: Present & Future Stages

As the MWC network continues performing flawlessly according to the consensus rules the
market may generate more trust and confidence in MWC’s ability to help them solve
problems they face. As the Initial stock have been fully distributed, MWC development is
now funded only by donations from the community. The development and implementation
of non-interactive transaction scheme (NIT) will set apart MWC from other MimbleWimble
coins by greatly improving usability and privacy. For continued updates as to the future
goals of development please refer to our roadmap.

TrueChain

—ybr id Consensus Public Chain

with High Performance
Abstract

It is the demand of the times and the dream of TrueChain to create a public chain that
will carry the future commercial decentralized applications. Based on the hybrid
consensus mechanism, TrueChain aims to provide high-speed point-to-point
communication, value transfer and the infrastructures of smart contract for the society.

The ultimate goal of decentralization is to create a free and mutual trust society.
Thanks to the efforts of public chain projects like Etherum, public chain has developed
significantly, and the commercialization of digital currency and smart contracts has
become possible. Prior to this, some private chain and alliance chain have been
successfully applied to make people have greater expectations for public chain
developers. It is hoped that the arrival of the commercial public chain can solve the
practical problems of high cost, such as digital payment, smart contract and so on.
However, the core reason why the public chain is different from the private chain and
the alliance chain is that the design of the consensus mechanism needs to ensure that
the unfamiliar and scale extending nodes can build trust between each other through
technical means, accomplish tasks together and ensure the stable and efficient
operation of the public chain. Most of the existing consensus mechanism design is
difficult to achieve a good balance between security and performance, as the dilemma
between decentralized decision-making and administrative efficiency, has plagued the
public chain developers.

TrueChain hopes to keep the essence of decentralization while improving efficiency as
much as possible simultaneously. The emergence of the hybrid consensus mechanism
which combined POW with PBFT brings a ray of dawn to the solution of the problem.
Il. Strength

Support entry of infinite nodes

For large-scale commercial applications such as Internet e-commerce, instant
messaging software, and bilateral trading platforms, supporting large-scale and
increasing number of users is a necessary condition for the public chain to carry them.
The communication complexity of PBFT determines that nodes participating in
decision making can only be kept in a very limited range. The combination of the
characteristics of POW that can accept unlimited nodes can make up for this
disadvantage.

Safety

Because there is no guarantee in PBFT mechanism that all nodes participate in
decision-making, there are relatively strong moral hazard and security risks. A small
number of nodes' inaction or downtime may result in data tampering of other nodes
or full chain paralysis. On the basis of POW, a hybrid consensus mechanism for the
election of PBFT backbone nodes is designed to ensure timely re-election of the PBFT
backbone nodes and monitor the backbone nodes in real time.

High performance

The timely recording of user transactions is a guarantee for the availability and security
of the public chain. The communication efficiency of PBFT backbone nodes is sufficient
to support 10000-100000 TPS (transactions per second). It is possible to ensure that
the whole chain communication is not blocked while multiple smart contracts or
commercial applications deal with transactions at the same time, and the ledger
accurately records the transactions in chronological order.

Free use

Whether it is the initial test network or the future main network Stellar, TrueChain will
remain open to all users free of charge. TrueChain always considers that the public
chain is an infrastructure for all users, not a profit making tool. It is not only for
TrueChain to find an appropriate source of profit in the future, but also for the
development of public chain, or even the whole block chain industry.
Technical architecture

The technical framework of TrueChain is divided into three layers from bottom to top:
hybrid consensus mechanism, smart contract and contract abstraction. For the specific
design, please refer to the yellow book or GitHub open source code:

https://github.com/truechain.

Hybrid consensus mechanism

The design of consensus mechanism is the core difference between the public chain
and the private chain and the alliance chain. It needs to be decentralized enough to
achieve security, and high speed to ensure performance. The industry has basically
formed the understanding that it is difficult to balance the essence of decentralization
and efficiency only by single consensus mechanism. In order to make up for the
shortcomings of the previous two generations of block chain: Bitcoin and Etherum, of
which TPS are too low and prevent them from realistic commercial application
development, TrueChain selected a hybrid consensus mechanism combining the
efficiency of PBFT with the decentralization of POW. On the basis of guaranteeing the
essence of decentralization, a public chain with high performance and high reliability
can be realized to carry out the target of large-scale commercial Dapp operation.

The solution of distributed protocol is roughly divided into two parts. One kind of POW
solution, represented by bitcoin, has been proved to be difficult to go further in the
transaction processing speed; one is a PBFT solution represented by a large number of
private chains and alliance chains, which can efficiently deal with a large number of
transactions. However, the PBFT solution requires that many nodes participating in the
bookkeeping trust each other, so the nodes had better know each other before the
agreement comes into effect. There is no doubt that when applying backbone nodes
which records all transactions to the public chain architecture, a huge moral hazard
exists. Establishing a consensus mechanism of efficient mutual trust in the public chain
has become a worldwide difficulty.

The solution of TrueChain is taken by the director of the two. Keeping the mechanism
of PBFT remained, the selection of backbone nodes is open to the public chain, and
the POW protocol is used as the dynamic selection and agreement of the quasi-system
to support the backbone nodes. The establishment of the backbone nodes community
is converted from the nature of the private chain and the alliance chain to the public
chain nature.

Smart contract
Smart contract layer is a key step in the application of consensus mechanism. The
operation of smart contracts must rely on the completion of virtual machines to ensure
that unified smart contracts can compute the same results in different environments.
TrueChain inherited the design idea of EVM, and launched TVM on PBFT. TVM will be
implanted into each backbone node, enabling them to invoke requests based on
individual requirements.

Contract abstraction

The contract abstraction layer will abstract the basic business logic in the abstract
smart contract, and simplify the process of developing complex smart contracts by
developers.
Applications

Insurance

Insurance is also a field that can be put into force for TrueChain. The integration of
block chain and insurance industry can really promote the development of insurance
to automatic claims. The intelligent contracts under the block chain can automatically
make claims when the triggering conditions happen, avoid cumbersome claims steps
and get rid of possible moral hazard. Agricultural insurance has always been a difficult
area for insurance to be involved in, because the grain output is affected by many
natural and human factors. It is difficult to retain the evidence, so it is difficult for
farmers to understand and accept agricultural risks. If the sensor is used to measure
the weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed and so on, the
automatic claim is triggered when the condition is reached, and the low cost, rapid
and standardized claim will be realized by the characteristics of automatic completion
and non-tampering of the smart contract. The same can be applied to aircraft delay
risk. By calling the airline or the airport public interface, the smart contract
automatically determines whether the flight is delayed and the cause of the delay is
determined, thereby automatically triggering the claim. When the flight is delayed,
passengers may calm down when seeing their account balance increasing. Large scale
of siege around the boarding gate will not break up.

In addition, the traditional insurance industry may be subverted by the new mutual
insurance model. Mutual insurance and decentralization trading mechanism are
completely interconnected. All users are completely equal, instead of in a weak
position compared to the insurance companies. Since the intermediary is no longer
required to act as an organizer to establish a pool of funds, users can fully utilize the
design of the block chain consensus mechanism and establish insurance on the form
of point to point mutual assistance. Each premium payment can be traceable, open,
transparent, timely and efficient. Combined with the hybrid consensus mechanism of
TrueChain, mutual insurance can also be supervised to ensure the emergence of moral
hazard.

Block chain technology enables the insurance industry to return to the main business
of matching supply and demand and calculating risks, rather than focusing on asset

management capabilities as much as today. This should not be the intention of
insurance.

Medical care

In the medical field, the anonymity and decentralization of the block chain can be used
to protect the patient's privacy. Electronic health cases (EHR), DNA purse, and drug
anti-counterfeiting are all possible applications of block chain technology.

IBM published a report on health care and block chain in 2017, which specifically
explained the potential value of block chain technology in clinical laboratory records,
regulatory compliance, and medical / health monitoring records, as well as health
management, medical equipment data records, drug treatment, billing and claims,
safety of adverse events, medical assets management, medical contract management
and other special advantages.

In terms of EHR, an individual's complete health history record contains all the vital
signs, high and accurate records of the medicine, the doctor's diagnosis, the patient's
disease, and all the information related to the operation. The whole historical data
related to the medical staff, the location and the events are valuable for precision
treatment and disease prevention. The block chain happens to be the right one. The
data of individual and institutional groups are stored and shared in real time.

In the system of TrueChain, every transaction has timestamp, and becomes a part of
the permanent record which cannot be tampered with afterwards. All nodes can view
all records in a public chain without permission. In a permission-restricted public chain
environment, each node can establish a consensus mechanism to determine the
node's access to the transaction, thus maintaining privacy and concealment of the real
identity of each node when needed. In this way, the block chain realizes the complete
record of the asset lifecycle. When assets flow through the entire supply chain, no
matter patient health records or a bottle of pills, all records are clearly visible.

IBM investigates the value of medical executives to the block chain, and executives
generally believe that block chains can most effectively eliminate medical information
friction, including incomplete information, information risk and inability to access
information. For example, computer records can ensure the accuracy of information
input, and the property of the block chain, such as the selection of the fastest and best
information into the database and the high security, will break through the past
medical information barriers and maximize its own strength.

The standardization of smart contracts is a key link in the application of block chains,
which is of great value in the supervision of medical behavior. When non-compliance
events occur, smart contracts will automatically track compliance and send
notifications to relevant parties in real time, effectively remove inspection links,
simplify the implementation process, and reduce supervision costs.

On the basis of data confidentiality and reliable quality, organizations, institutions and
enterprises can join the system and cooperate with data. Using personal health data,
medical equipment data, data collected by medical and nursing staff, developing new
medical applications or providing services, implementing health management and
creating new data sources, can form a larger block chain ecology and a virtuous cycle.

In terms of billing and claims, block chains can also effectively prevent improper
behavior such as fraud, and reduce the waste of medical resources. Enterprise
PokitDok, Capital One, and Gem proposed a platform supported by block chains to
help patients before receiving treatment, determine the amount of self-payment in
advance, provide pre-payment services, avoid the unexpected costs of the patients,
and to reduce the amount of unpaid payments by medical institutions.

The traceability of block chain also includes the tracing of medical malpractice and the
backtracking and supervision of drugs. For example, the establishment of a consistent
drug distribution and management system will be a fatal blow to counterfeit drugs.
Because the data of the block chain is updated and widely shared, pharmacies,
manufacturers, buyers, regulators and other parties can observe the flow of data in
real time, including drug manufacturing and distribution information, so as to
strengthen drug regulation and prevent counterfeit drugs from entering the market. It
is reported that the UK company, Blockverify, is one of the organizations to carry out
drug source pilot projects to help medical staff verify authenticity through scanning
drugs.

Block chain can eliminate adverse safety incidents, such as solving the safety problems
of medical devices, especially the health devices connected to the network. In 2016,
Johnson warned patients that their "OneTouch Ping" insulin pump was easily attacked
by hackers, and FDA had reported a network security leak in St. Judah's medical heart
equipment. Therefore, the normal operation of medical devices connected to the
network is very important. Maintaining network security is also an important
application of block chain in medical scenes.

Game

The combination of the block chain and the game refers to the creation of virtual assets
for collection on the block chain, which is not like Etherum cat or Etherum Three
Kingdoms, in which the players can obtain the false "block chain" game through the
contribution of new players and the circulation of the virtual assets, but the use of
cross chain technology in the game production which can upgrade the industry.

As far as current development is concerned, the focus of block chain can be applied to
the game of virtual asset circulation and gaming platform. For most games, the users
are not sticky enough and may lose quickly after playing Company A's game, because
its gain in Company A's game can't be transformed into a drive to play other games of
Company A. Through applying the block chain technology, the traceability, convenient
circulation and low cost of the virtual assets can be ensured, and the loyalty of the old
players can be greatly improved, the ecology between different games of A company
and the life cycle of the users can be extended. Small game companies can even unite
to trade virtual assets in the same chain, in order to reduce user diversion costs and
enhance user dependency.

Large games often hold many friendly matches and league matches. Using block chain
smart contract can solve problems such as timely delivery and transparency. When the
interface invocation gets the result of the game, the code automatically runs to
complete the gambling delivery.

Public welfare

Public welfare is one of the main themes of today's time. By the end of July 2017,
among the 70 million poor people in our country, nearly 30 million of the poor were
poor. How to make public welfare more efficient, more fair and more transparent is
the wish of every public welfare person.

Donors, out of social responsibility or personal love, donate money to charitable
organizations to help the trapped groups or improve social problems. Where are these
money used in the end? It may be a question mark in the hearts of every donor. The
charity department will often be challenged. How can we prove that the money has
been sent to the disaster area? How can we prove that hospitals really donate money
to patients? The two sides often produce a lot of contradictions, like suspension of the
source of denoted money, embezzlement, corruption and so on. It not only reduces
the donated money, but also hurts the feelings of the donor.

The application of block chain technology to public charity will change the traditional
mode of public charity donation information transmission. As a distributed ledger
technology, the information on block chain has the characteristics of non-tampered,
transparent and traceable. It can solve the pain point of public welfare charitable cause
perfectly. When the user's good money enters the block chain system, it will be
automatically recorded on the ledger of block chain and stamped with a timestamp.
This record cannot be tampered and every donation and support will be tracked as
"express".

Many blocks chain and charity projects have been tried to land.

In July 2016, the Ant charity block chain was officially launched. "Let the deaf children
get the new sound" became the small scale test project of the Ant Financial and the
Chinese Social Assistance Foundation. The new edition was launched in December
2016, adding the first block chain of the Chinese Red Cross Foundation "Say Goodbye
to the Hearing Barrier" and the "Children Illuminating the Stars", realizing the real time
account publicity and helping to solve the "pain point" of public financial transparency.
Until March 16, 2017, all the donation project on Alipay has been accessed to the ant
block chain platform. Statistics show that, by January 30, 2018, there were 37 public
welfare institutions, more than 300 public welfare projects, access to the Ant Block
Chain Platform. More than 9.37 million donations have collected a total amount of
over 48 million yuan donations.

In December 2016, the network mutual support platform held a "Heart Chain"
conference in Shanghai. "Heart Chain" is a product which relies on block chain
technology, specially designed for the public welfare industry. Relying on the block
chain technology, all donations will be recorded on the "heart chain". Data including
the amount of donations, capital flow is open and transparent. It is impossible for the
public funds to be misappropriated illegally. This also makes personal kindhearted
behaviors an objective "digital asset". As of October 2017, the times of platform
donation has exceeded 100 million, and nearly 2 billion of the assets had been issued.

Numerous examples show the future trend of the integration of block chain and charity.

Asset Securitization

The extension of the digital currency lies in the token. Assets can be converted into
tokens, and token can be turned into a proof of the assets usage rights. The
transformation of assets into currency is a kind of securitization. If a book can be set
up between the nodes and all the assets in the asset securitization pool are moved to
this book, all the characteristics of the basic assets are marked, the block updates
according to the transaction time which means non-tampered, and regular following
up is conducted, the effective combination of asset securitization and block chain can
be realized.

Digital advertising industry

The digital advertising industry monopolized by Facebook, Alibaba, Google, Baidu and
other Internet giants has many industry pain points. Small and medium-sized
advertising media, constrained by the size of Internet giants, are forced to form a "flow
alliance" with weak bargaining power. For advertisers, the users who can modify the
data and the group that is difficult to measure makes the digital advertisers face
serious information asymmetry. Advertisers often pay high advertising costs for
distorted users' clicks and coverage, but fail to achieve the desired results.

The existence of many advertising trading platforms has provided an alternative
solution to advertisers to some extent, but the trust problem between the two sides
has not been eliminated. On one hand, some advertising platforms rely on the
development of robots to increase the amount of advertising clicks and cheat for
advertising fees; on the other hand, some advertisers refuse to pay advertising costs
before the advertising media is released. Therefore, in fact, compared with the
Internet advertising platform, the small and medium-sized advertising platform has
lower efficiency and less mutual trust.

In the final analysis, the crux of the digital advertising industry lies in the trust
mechanism. In the face of the high cost of trusting the Internet giants and the less
expensive but fraudulent situations, advertisers are most hopeful of the emergence of
a low-cost mutual trust trading platform. The commercial application of block chain
technology makes this hope a reality.

Because of the characteristics of de-centralization, anonymity, openness, autonomy
and irreversibility of transaction records, block chain technology provides a
transparent and mutual trust trading platform for its advertisers. Followings can be
mainly realized:

(1) data can be transmitted to the audience and can be counted.

(2) advertisers and advertising media are safe in funding.

(3) translucent transactions of all parties.

By using smart contracts, both parties can establish a safe and reliable trading
mechanism, and make the advertising result measurable and reduce transaction costs.
Users involved in advertising transactions have also entered the economic ecosystem
of TrueChain, which can acquire or create higher added value in TrueChain’s ecology.

Micropayments

In many situations, people occupy too much public resources or cause negative
externalities but fail to pay the corresponding remuneration. If the rear vehicle
exceeds the front vehicle from the left, it actually takes up the road traffic resources
of the fast lane. A front car with the right of way has to slow down and yield the rear
vehicle. If the times of autopilot is coming, when the rear car has the need to surpass
the front car, it can send out a request for transcending from the left side and pays a
small fee, and the front car will automatically yield to it after receiving the request. It
can not only guarantee the completion of Overtaking Behavior, but also make the front
car gain from giving up the right of way, which is safe and fair.

For another example, solve the problem of spam emails and spam messages. Assume
every mail and text message is required to pay the counterpart a small fee before
sending. For the normal communication, the cost of communication is not significantly
improved because they send messages in both directions, but for people who send a
large number of spammers or spam messages, they will face a huge cost which reduces
the possibility of sending garbage information in one way greatly.

The realization of small payment must be done by block chain without charge.
TrueChain that provides high performance and stable trading environment is just
suitable for these scenes.

Value transmission

Although there is a long way for block chaining technology to go, it can be seen that
its application in the financial field is inevitable. It is not only currency creation, but
the real changes that the block chain can bring to the financial industry lie in the value
transmission and the public account. Many institutions both at home and abroad have
made active exploration in the aspects of payment and settlement, asset registration
and asset transfer. Because the block chain is a public, traceable, and non-tampered
distributed general ledger system, it can effectively reduce the error rate of payment,
liquidation, settlement steps, and monitor the inflow and outflow of each step of funds
simultaneously, promoting the establishment of a faithful society and be conducive to
financial supervision. With the development of block chain technology, the
authenticity of assets will be further guaranteed.

Digital copyright

DECENT, a block chain company in Switzerland, hopes to use block chain technology
to improve digital rights management. Through the digital video fingerprint
identification, the unique "fingerprint" is abstracted from the motion change, color
and key frame of the video. This fingerprint is used to track the video content on the
protection network. Because of the uniqueness and irreversibility of the hash coding
used widely in block chain data storage, the encoding of each file is not the same.
Digital fingerprinting technology can systematically use the detailed characteristics of
documents to distinguish genuine and pirated content, and trace the source of piracy.

Other application scenarios

Using the extensibility of its nodes and the efficiency and security of the consensus
mechanism, TrueChain can be more applied to the fields of financial formats like
mobile digital bill of exchange, securities trading, and supply chain management,
property right tracking, digital certificate, etc.

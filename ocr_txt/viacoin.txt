Abstract

Viacoin is an open source crypto-currency created in 2014, derived from the [IZ]Bitcoin protocol
that supports embedded consensus with an extended OP_RETURN of 120 byte. Viacoin features
Scrypt Merged mining, also called Auxiliary proof of work or AuxPoW, and 25x faster transactions
than Bitcoin. Viacoin mining reward halving takes place every 6 months and has a total supply of
23,176,392.41459 coins. The inflation rate of Viacoin is low due to minimal mining reward. As the
block reward of Viacoin is low, miners are given incentive to mine Viacoin through Merged mining
(AuxPoW). Viacoin is currently mined by one of the biggest mining pools (F2Pool) with a very high
hashrate.

Other features include a mining difficulty adjustment algorithm to address flaws in Kimotos
Gravity Well (DarkGravityWave), Versionbits to allow for 29 simultaneous Soft Fork changes to be
implemented at a time, Segwit and the Lightning Network

Note: The whitepaper, documentation, designs are in research and development phase and subject to change.
1 Scrypt

In cryptography, [8]Scrypt is a password based key derivation function created by Colin Percival. The al-
gorithm was designed to make it costly to perform large-scale custom hardware attacks by requiring large
amounts of memory. In 2012, the algorithm was published by the IETF as an internet draft intended to
become an informational RFC, but a version of Scrypt is now used as a proof of work scheme by cryptocur-
rencies like Viacoin.

Scrypt is a memory hard key derivation function, it requires a reasonably large amount of Random Ac-
cess Memory to be evaluated. This makes implementation in special purpose custom hardware (ASICs)
require more VLSI area, which would make it unprofitable to build for the purpose of mining Viacoins. The
requirement of Scrypt algorithm is a large array of pseudo random bits to be held in memory and a key that
is derived from this. The algorithm is based on TMTO (Time-Memory Tradeoff). ASIC advantage in Viacoin
is reduced by a factor of 10 compared to Bitcoin.

Scrypt uses the following parameters to generate a derived key:
e Passphrase: String of characters to hash

e Salt: Random string provided to Scrypt functions

N: Memory/CPU cost parameter

P: Parallelization parameter

R: Blocksize parameter
e dkLen: Intended length of the key derived key in bytes
kd = scrypt(P, S, N, P, R,dkLen)

Viacoin parameters where N=1024, R=1, P=1 and S= random 80 bytes producing a 256-bit output

2 Merged Mining AuxPoW

Viacoin [2]Merged mining aims to reuse the mining power of any other [8]Scrypt coin to add security to the
Viacoin blockchain, allowing a miner to mine for more than one blockchain at the same time. For example, a
miner could mine Viacoin and Litecoin or any other Scrypt coin together with Viacoin with little to no impact
on the hashrate of either one.

Every hash the miner contributes is for the total hashrate of both cryptocurrencies and results in a more
secure blockchain. An AuxPoW block is a type of block similar to a standard Bitcoin block with two dif-
ferences. The hash of the block header does not meet the difficulty level of the blockchain. Secondly, it has
additional data elements that shows that the miner who created a block did mining on the parent blockchain
and that works meet the difficulty level of the aux blockchain.

Miners have an incentive to mine Viacoin even if the reward is low as they are able to mine any other
Scrypt coin simultaneously Viacoin for free. As Viacoin mining isn’t driven by large block rewards, this al-
lows Viacoin to have a lower rate of inflation compared to other cryptocurrencies that do not support merged
mining.
3 Anti Gravity Wave

Anti Gravity Wave (AGW) is an open source difficulty algorithm. It comes from the Dark Gravity Wave
(DGW) [4] algorithm that had been authored by Evan Duffield, the developer and creator of X11/Darkcoin/Dash.
The algorithm had been designed to address flaws like the Time warp attack in Kimoto Gravity Wave algo-
rithm. Both DGW and AGW readjust block difficulty by using blockchain statistics on recently found blocks.

Anti Gravity Wave is a Via modification of the DGW. As a DGW, AGW makes use of simple and expo-
nential moving averages of block actual timespans in the blockchain in order to smoothen the readjustment
mechanism. In Anti Gravity Wave difficulty readjustes every block by the following rule:

ait Dy astBlock—i
=e amt 1
Gar i+] ( )
Where Dy, is the difficulty of the block m. Given the following sequence (I), the 72nd term a7 is found.
Then two timespans are determined, Tactyqi AN Ttarget- Tactual is the actual time of the last 72 blocks had been
calculated by the network, whereas Target is the nominal target value.

Tactual = TLastBlock ~ TLastBlock—72
Trarget = (72 — 1) * 24

Anti Gravity Wave algorithm can also readjust the target if it is too big or too small for the network. Final
block difficulty is determined by as following:

472 * Tactual

Target =
8 Trarget

Anti Gravity Wave allows improved difficulty retargeting compared to the well known Kimo Gravity Well
algorithm.

4 Segwit

Viacoin has [I3]Segwit (BIP 141) activated. Segregated Witness helps to shrink the size of a transaction and
cope with the UTXO growth. Segregated Witness is a transaction format where witness data is segregated
from the transaction. It also aims to increase the per-block transaction throughput by a factor of 2 or 3, while
simultaneously making block syncing faster for new nodes.

The main purpose of Segwit implementation in Viacoin is not to increase capacity however, it is to fix
malleability and make scripting easier to upgrade. Fixing malleability allows for the addition of features
in Viacoin like [[atomic swaps, bidirectional payment channels and Lightning networks that could increase
Viacoin interoperability with Bitcoin.

Segwit includes versioning for scripts so that additional opcodes (that would normally require a hard-fork in
non-segwit transactions) can be used instead. Easier changes to script opcodes will make advancing Viacoin
easier. This makes the addition of Schnorr signatures, sidechains, MAST and other features possible.

5 The Lightning Network

[B]The Lightning Network is a transfer network operating at a layer above the Viacoin blockchain using smart
contract functionality in the blockchain to enable instant payments across a network of participants. This
enables improvements of several orders of magnitude in transaction throughput by moving the majority of
transactions outside the consensus ledgers into Payment channels. This allows millions to billions of transac-
tions per second across the network. A capacity that blows away legacy payment rails. This is made possible
by supporting on-chain scripts in which parties enter into bilateral stateful contracts, in which the state can
be updated by sharing a digital signature and can be closed by publishing evidence onto the blockchain.

The Lightning Network allows for exceptionally low fees. For a low-value transaction, the Lightning Net-
work is the silver bullet. It allows for new kinds of commerce. By opening a payment channel with many
parties, participants in the LN can become a focal point for routing the payment of others leading into a
fully connected payment channel. The payments are enforced using a script which enforces the atomicity via
decrementing time-locks.

Another benefit is the possibility of atomic cross-chain transactions, enabling users to trade viacoin, bitcoin,
litecoin and other Segwit coins instantaneously, allowing for extremely efficient, decentralized exchanges or
a decentralized form of ’Shapeshift.io’. Viacoin already supports atomic swaps, which had been tested [3]
with litecoin, decred and bitcoin blockchains.
6 Schnorr signature

Schnorr signature aggregation is part of upcoming developments as well. This functionality has also been
proposed in Bitcoin as the successor of ECDSA as it is a more efficient algorithm. Until recently, in Viacoin
and in many other cryptocoins, it was not possible to implement Schnorr signatures without a hardfork.
Now with the malleability of Segwit, it is possible. All signature data is moved to the witness. Viacoin
currently utilized Elliptic Curve Digital Signatures (ECDSA) as a zk proof of ownership in order to authorize
the transfer from one output to another. In 2015, Daniel J. Bernstein proposed to use a Schnorr like signature
on top of an Elliptic Curve.

Some Advantages:
e Provably secure under standard assumptions
e Immunity to malleability
e Resistance to hash-function collisions
e Batch validation for a 2-3x speedup
e Native k-of-k Multisignatures ...

Schnorr signature supports batch validation, which means that if you have a group of public key message
signature pairs rather than just a single one, you can verify the authenticity of the group as a whole at a higher
speed than each of them individually. This method is ideal since blocks are just big batches of signatures to
validate.
Native k-of-k multi signatures, the idea of Schnorr is that you can take multiple keys together and have
a single signature that proves that all of them are signed. A group can create a signature valid for the
sum of keys. U1, U2 and U3 are the users. Theres a 2 round interaction scheme where they all come
up with a nonce k1, k2, k3 and they all compute a corresponding public point R1, R2, R3. They com-
municate those to each other and add them up with an overall R value. This overall R value signs this
nonce with their own key resulting in an S1, 2, S3 and then you combine all the S values into one final
S. A signature that will be valid for the sum of their keys. This has the advantage of the k-of-k multisig.

Uy > ky, Ri U; > (R, 51)
Uz — ko, Ro R Un + (R, 82) (R, s)
Us — ks, Rg Us — (R, 53)

Even if there is not a k-of-k situation, any other policy of what combination of keys can be signed. All one
needs is a merkle tree plus the ability for Schnorr to add up and build a tree where every node leaf of the
tree is a combination of keys that can be signed. These then need to be hashed together and the root is the
address. OP_CHECKSIG & OP_CHECKMULTISIG will be modified so that they can stack pubkeys, delin-
earize and associate validated inputs and produce a combined signature for the transaction resulting into a
20% reduction in block size.

It is possible to do aggregation over all signatures in a single transaction. The idea behind it, is to enable
system validators like Viacoin nodes to compute a single key for every input of all transactions.
7 Non-atomic flushing

In order to make the system robust, the state on the disk has to be persistent with a block. With an unexpected
shutdown of the wallet, we can startup and rollback or roll forward inside of it and be able to get a consistent
tip on the disk. Normally whenever the cache would fill up, a flush would be forced. If it is present at startup
it means we crashed during flush, and we rollback/roll forward blocks inside of it to get a consistent tip on
disk before proceeding.

8 Colored coins

Viacoin scripting language allows to store small amounts of metadata on the blockchain which can represent
asset manipulation instructions. A Viacoin transaction can be encoded that x units of a new asset were issued
and are credited to a Viacoin address. The term is derived from the idea of coloring a nominal amount of
coins. By coloring a Viacoin, it turns into a token that can represent anything a user wants to trade like com-
pany stocks or physical goods. This seems very similar to ‘Counterparty’ but there are some key differences.
It uses the Viacoin blockchain (e.g NXT).

It does not issue an auxiliary coin (e.g Counterparty and Mastercoin). The metadata gives meaning to a
[10]colored coin transaction which is usually stored in one of the OP_LRETURN opcodes. The output contain-
ing the OP_RETURN is called a marker output. This marker output can have a zero or non-zero value, and it
starts with the OP_LRETURN opcode and can be followed by any sequence of opcodes which must contain a
PUSHDATA opcode containing a parsable open Asset market Payload. The asset quantity list field is used to
determine the quantity of each output of the asset and each integer is using LEB128 encoding. If this exceeds
9 bytes, the market output is deemed invalid. The maximum asset quantity for an output is 263 — 1 units.
The colored coins [5JOpen Asset Protocol sits on top of the Viacoin protocol. It does not require any changes
to the Viacoin protocol itself.

9 MAST (Merkelized Abstract Syntax Trees)

[MIMAST allows Viacoin transaction validation scripts to be stored in partially-hashed form and allows nodes
to interact with Merkle Trees. When spending, users may provide only the branches they are executing, and
hashes that connect the branches to the fixed size Merkle root. This reduces the size of the redemption stack
from O(n) to O(log) (n as the number of branches). This enables complicated redemption conditions that
is currently not possible due to the script size and opcode limit, improves privacy by hiding unexecuted
branches, and allows inclusion of non-consensus enforced data with very low or no additional cost.

It is important because MAST allows smart contracts to be created without clogging up the blockchain.
Usually all smart contracts would be visible on the blockchain and take up space. With MAST it is possible
to only reveal the smart contracts that have been completed, saving space as nodes only have to read the
top layer of the Merkle Tree. This may seem familiar to Ethereum’s smart contract system but there is a
difference.Ethereum accesses a VM directly whereas VIA will obtain access to a VM though RootStock (RSK).
RSK aims to be what Ethereum should have been: a decentralized, Turing-complete smart contract platform.

10 Viacoin RSK smart contracts

[G]RootStock is a smart contract platform which has a two-way peg. The idea is to enable it to work with
smart contracts. Rootstock runs a turing complete Virtual machine called Rootstock Virtual Machine (which
is also compatible with Ethereum virtual machine!) and allows solidity compiled smart contracts to run. It
could work by merge mining with Viacoin, which allows the RSK blockchain to have the same security level
as Viacoin. It should allow for approximately 2000 transactions per second on-chain and 20000 transactions
per second off-chain.

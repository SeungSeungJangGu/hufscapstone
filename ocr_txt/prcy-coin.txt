1. Purpose

1.1 Who we are

PRCY Team feels very strongly about the community. PRCY is there for and with the community.
Our goals are to deliver the project within the expectation of those who support the project.
Privacy is what we are aiming on individual level, but also on Business level. PRCY has superior
technology with the most advanced privacy features.

PRCY is a fully anonymous staking coin and a payment system with a trustless governance
structure. This is all based on the latest state of the art privacy technology (RingCT, Ring
Signatures, Stealth Addresses, Bulletproof and more). Although the PRCY chain is 100% private,
it allows a wide variety of passive income, staking, masternodes and Proof of Audit (PoA).

yn A
reas telnodgs

PRCY does not offer partial anonymity like some other privacy coins, PRCY offers 100% absolute
privacy without doubt, by means of offering the best of best privacy protocols which are
successfully tested. PRCY offers PoA as the solution of trust which many other blockchain do
not contain. PRCY does not rely on nodes or a group of administrators. The PRCY blockchain is a
hybrid Proof of Stake (PoS) and PoA blocks. The PoS are minted every minute by staking nodes
to verify the transactions in the blockchain. The PoA block are mined by PRCY miners (investors)
with one task to audit the system if it is functioning according to the predetermined conditions.
The PoA block will audit at least 59 PoS blocks for its correctness, each PoA auditor (miner) will
be rewarded by auditing the blockchain system.

1.2 Challenges

With the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the EU framework
more and more people being aware with protection of private data. One of the main pain
points we acknowledge with Bitcoin and Ethereum is everyone who knows your wallet address
is able to see your holdings.

In recent times, governments and regulators around the world have highlighted the utility value
of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to criminals. For example, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin
recently said he wants to make sure that cryptocurrencies do not fall into the hands of “bad

guys.”

Their attention is expected to make cryptocurrencies transparent so that consumers and
businesses are comfortable with using them.

1.3 Privacy Coins Are Unstoppable

PRCY team and developers has started to use their knowledge to provide a Savings and
Payment blockchain as Private as anyone can think of nowadays. Reached by using
functionalities, which are able to block outsiders following, and sharing any information
according to processes taking place on the PRCY blockchain.

PRCY believes attempting to ban private cryptocurrencies would be nearly impossible for regulators due
to the tokens’ privacy-preserving, decentralized nature. So that is why PRCY will state: privacy coins are
unstoppable.

Privacy coins work differently to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum—payments are
untraceable, helping users to maintain privacy. Where every Bitcoin transaction can easily be
linked to a user’s address, PRCY uses an obfuscated public ledger to hide the details of each
transaction.

Highlighting the difficulties regulators are likely to face in halting privacy coins. CEO PRCY
believes and shares a widely spread view and his idea.

“if decentralized privacy cryptocurrencies become (more) popular in the near
future, to the point they can be easily and routinely exchanged without investors
having to convert to other currencies and systems, there is no obvious way for
regulators to impose post-hoc regulation.”

PRCY believes that authorities would benefit from adapting and preparing for the possibility of
being unable to prevent the spread of privacy coins in the future. “What many regulators do
not realize is those who control the code will control the rules. If you cannot share, you cannot
multiply,” the CEO PRCY said. “So far, they have not accepted this and are in denial.”

5|Page
PRCY© — Whitepaper V 1.0
To hear the philosophy of the CEO PRCY and his thoughts on how privacy coins will play a role in
the future of the cryptocurrency landscape are the following:

“PRCY believes it is possible that a lot of governments will try to outright ban any
crypto that attempts to provide a level of privacy features above the current
“status quo”. PRCY believes it will ensure that privacy-preserving currencies
become the route for protest against the incumbent financial system. PRCY has a
strong belief because privacy infractions and violations have become the
mainstay of the financial system. The evolution or birth of crypto is the most
simple answer to this.

The CEO PRCY also pondered an alternative outcome in which governments are more accepting
of private cryptocurrencies. He believes that relaxed regulations and a deeper understanding of
the dangers of transparent coins like Bitcoin could lead to wider adoption of privacy coins,
“much like how users are starting to realize the nefariousness of Big Tech companies like
Facebook and Google.”

In the past, much discussion has fallen on the role cryptocurrencies sometimes play in criminal
activities such as money laundering and drug dealing, thanks in no small part to Bitcoin’s
prominence on darknet marketplaces such as the Silk Road.

While Bitcoin has in many ways been embraced as an asset class since Silk Road’s widely
documented shutdown, private cryptocurrencies still represent a largely unknown area of the
ecosystem. CEO PRCY “Regulators and compliance professions should soon realize that PRCY is
not the only project that offers useful privacy features. Other ‘privacy coins’ offer intrinsic or
opt-in privacy enhancements that they need to be prepared for. Even Bitcoin and Ethereum,
which are widely-supported, are adopting new privacy enhancements. These technologies can
no longer be ignored.”

1.4 The Use Cases For PRCY

At first glance, the protocols and examples provided above might make it seem that criminal
activities and actors are the primary use cases and users for privacy-focused coins. But when
one considers current regulations for commercial transactions, utility of privacy features
dramatically expands.

A new class of coins, which bridge the gap between the anonymous world of cryptocurrencies
and the real world of business applications and commercial transactions, has emerged to take
advantage of this space. For example, XRP have included functionality that enables disclosing of
transaction data and identity metrics to comply with regulatory agencies.

6|Page
PRCY© — Whitepaper V 1.0
At some other privacy coins the PrivateSend feature is optional. This means it can be utilized for
transactions that users of the cryptocurrency would like to keep hidden from the public
blockchain. As an example, rent payments and salary information can be hidden from other
users.

CEO PRCY “Privacy is important for many practical reasons including user safety. “It is also a
safety issue for users that could be targeted by criminals that become aware of a user’s
holdings by tracing their transactions.”

PRCY angel investor “Around the world, people will want money that is not accessible to
others,” A well-known privacy coin is being tested by multiple US banks for this purpose.

Another example Venezuela and Zimbabwe have reportedly witnessed a surge in the use of
cryptocurrencies as their economies deteriorate. In fact, users in these countries are willing to
pay a premium to own Bitcoin.

Competitive pressures and market demand will likely push most cryptocurrency projects to
adopt strong privacy primitives, adding that high-encryption techniques that enable masking of
user and transaction identity will “likely be pervasive across future money.

2. Market and Industry

2.1 Short Term

Short-term focus for PRCY will be on the development and functionality of the PRCY
infrastructure. Starting to work on the accessibility to PRCY coin. In other words, make it
possible to investors to provide the opportunity to own PRCY coins and to store PRCY coins in
their own PRCY QT wallet. The functionality of storage of PRCY coins will be extended to a multi
coin mobile wallet and a PRCY mobile wallet.

PRCY will focus to expand the community and with a growing community the PRCY blockchain
will be a secure blockchain by Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of Audit
(PoA).

The PRCY blockchain is built for and on privacy and trust. Nowadays with open internet, social
media, but also in cryptocurrency users are being exposed to cyber criminality more often.

PRCY started this project as we believe that steps need to be taken to provide users being
exposed to any type of criminality regarding their finance, whether this is their savings,
payments or other transactions.

To provide this trust, we have created a privacy network every user could rely on that it will
bring back the control of their finance as they expect.

2.2 Long Term

Long-Term focus for PRCY will be on Business-to-Customer (B2C) and after that Business-to-
Business (B2B).

The PRCY team foresees a big future for industrial acceptance of cryptocurrency in the near
future. Many people have gone digital, the trend accelerates during the global pandemic.
People are looking for solutions for their funds and hear, see and learn more about
cryptocurrencies and become more aware of their privacy rights. Slowly but surely more and
more people will invest in cryptocurrencies and will make use of privacy coins like PRCY.

This will thrive PRCY to relevant partnerships and utilize the privacy settings of PRCY, and
including the many passive income opportunities.

PRCY© — Whitepaper V 1.0
Just imagine large companies with billions of USD in savings and transactions. We can provide
them a safe and private market. Being prepared for any unwanted observers and unwanted
exposure to crime.

2.3 Wrap PRCY/New Developments

Although the focus is to strengthen the PRCY blockchain and to expand in community. New
developments in industry will be followed and are often great occasions to launch new
products and stay ahead.

Many popular crypto-exchanges are more and more focused to increase the accessibility to
private blockchains by means of a new product in the form of Wrapped coins, a PRCY-backed
token on Ethereum.

PRCY examines the possibility to create a PRCY based token on Ethereum and being backed 1:1
by PRCY and secured by the exchange. Wrapped PRCY will be similar to other synthetic tokens
like Wrapped Bitcoin [WBTC] or Wrapped Ethereum [WETH].

CEO PRCY “Wrapped PRCY brings greater liquidity to the Ethereum and DeFi
ecosystem. It gives holders of PRCY more flexibility to utilize their tokens
without having to sell it for Ethereum or stable coins, in order to access the
many exciting opportunities in the DeFi space.”

The crypto-based synthetic asset aims to provide users exposure to a variety of different assets
without needing to hold the underlying asset. PRCY anticipates on market tendency and see
many exchanges like Bittrex and Abra had delisted large other privacy coins, due to regulatory
concerns.

With WPRCY, users will be able to provide the necessary transparency. Wrapped PRCY will have
the same transparency as other ERC-20 tokens in the Ethereum blockchain, thus ensuring
necessary regulatory clearance concerning the transparency part of privacy coins.

As part of PRCY philosophy of accessibility PRCY will make use of the present Defi solutions who
will adopt ERC-20 tokens in the Ethereum blockchain and will make PRCY available via multi
Decentralized Exchanges.

Although Ethereum transparency instead of privacy, the investor have the ability to select the
technology he prefers and accompanied the transparency of his wish.

4. PRCY TEAM

4.1 Founders

Community members of former Privacy projects initiated the project in December 2020.
Together with a group of developers, they started the PRCY project to have a decentralized
environment from day 0. The founders are a group of people with different backgrounds with
an excellent mix of skills. We have got blockchain technology developers, Entrepreneurs,
knowing how to start and to run multiple enterprises, Business Developers focused on the
architecture of financial solutions and angel investors bringing in wisdom of life.

The project is funded by the owners and angel investors. PRCY believes in long term smart
efficient investing, meaning each USD will be invested in the project for development or
marketing purposes for the benefit of the community. The expansion of PRCY is key. PRCY will
sell the minimum of PRCY coins to raise funding for this sole purpose, each quarter the PRCY
team reports about the expenses and the number of coins sold. Trust is key, our actions are
transparent and verifiable.

4.2 Team anonymity

The PRCY Project is a community driven initiative with a varied source of contributors. It draws
inspiration from Monero and other privacy projects that elected to go (partly) anonymous in
line with the world’s most known token Bitcoin.

This is done to protect the project and the team and its users to assist in ensuring it can be
more decentralized from its outset. The focus should be on the project, its code and the
community that drives it, these are transparent and verifiable.

4.3 Central versus Decentral

For the workspace is chosen to start decentral. Meaning there is no top-to-bottom authority
model like with a central workspace. Also, the community will take part in the workspace by
being rewarded for engagements. PRCY will work on multiple sustainable plans for community
engagement, the retention plan was the kick off the engagement initiative.

5. PRCY Blockchain Features

5.1 What Are PRCY Coins?

PRCY coins are cryptocurrencies that specialize in keeping you and your transactions hidden.

Although the media portrays crypto as an anonymous, dark web currency, it’s actually quite
transparent. Most blockchain networks broadcast every transaction and wallet
balances publicly, so tracing someone’s financial activity isn’t all that difficult.

PRCY focus on keeping transactions anonymous and untraceable. Anonymity disassociates your
identity from your wallet and specific transactions while untrace ability prevents outside parties
from piecing together your blockchain activity.

Chain analysis isn’t simple, but several companies specialize in it, and they’re paid to do so.
Often, it’s a continuous game of cat-and-mouse between privacy coins and the software trying
to monitor them.

5.2 How do PRCY Work?

PRCY has technology tactics to keep your identity shielded. PRCY uses a mix of different
strategies. Let’s examine some of the most relevant ones.

Stealth Addresses

Stealth addresses are arguably the simplest way to improve your transaction privacy. At their
most basic, stealth addresses involve creating a new address each time you receive
cryptocurrency. Doing so ensures that outside parties can’t link any future payments to your
wallet address.

Although PRCY uses are more advanced complex tactics. PRCY uses a dual-key stealth address
protocol (DKSAP). The protocol gives all wallet owners a private view key, private spend key,
and a recipient address.

Stealth Addresses

INPUTS OUTPUTS

Commitment public key

Back to Sender

eySf8neS8nhSnogsefwjw —

You send crypto using the spend key and display incoming transactions with the view key.
Although your recipient address is public, the funds you receive from each sender go toa
separate, unique blockchain address. Only the sender and receiver in each transaction know
the fund’s final destination.

PRCY Ring Signatures
In a blockchain transaction, you sign a digital signature to verify that you’re the sender. You’re
the only person doing this signing, so it’s not tough for someone to trace it back to you.

PRCY Ring signatures combine you with other signers in a ring to hide you as the sender. The
higher the number of additional parties in the ring, the harder it is for someone to connect you
with the transaction.

PRCY© — Whitepaper V 1.0
PRCY RingCT

PRCY make use of Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCTs) build off the foundation of ring
signatures. In addition to masking your identity, PRCY RingCTs encrypt the output of your
transaction, concealing the amount.

PRCY Bulletproof

PRCY Bulletproofs are short non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs that require no trusted
setup. A PRCY bulletproof can be used to convince a verifier that an encrypted
plaintext/transaction is well formed. For example, prove that an encrypted number is in a given
range, without revealing anything else about the number. Compared to Zk-SNARKs, PRCY
Bulletproofs require no trusted setup. However, verifying a bulletproof is more time consuming
than verifying a SNARK proof.

Bulletproofs are designed to enable efficient confidential transactions in Bitcoin and other
cryptocurrencies. Confidential transactions hide the amount that is transferred in the
transaction. Every confidential transaction contains a cryptographic proof that the transaction
is valid. Bulletproofs shrink the size of the cryptographic proof from over 10kB to less than 1kB.
Moreover, bulletproofs support proof aggregation, so that proving that m transaction values
are valid adds only O(log(m)) additional elements to the size of a single proof. If all Bitcoin
transactions were confidential and used Bulletproofs, then the total size of the UTXO set would
be only 17 GB, compared to 160 GB with the currently used proofs.

The Importance of Privacy

You may not think that you need to keep your crypto activity private. If you’ve got nothing to
hide, then why worry about it, right? Well, there are quite a few reasons why you should be in
favor of a privacy-focused future.

To best explain the importance of privacy coins, let’s tie it to a more familiar example,
traditional banks. A blockchain without privacy mechanisms is like a bank that posts all of its
customers’ transactions online. Just search an account number, and you’ve got access to
someone’s complete financial history as well as the amount of money they possess.

Even though you probably don’t know anyone’s account number, it wouldn’t be a challenge to
figure one out if you wanted to. You can see the issue with that transparency. Blockchains are
no different.

Fungibility is Sound Money

Perhaps more important than individual privacy, though, is the necessity of fungibility in a
monetary system. Fungibility is a property in which you can interchange one currency unit

for any other unit. For instance, every gram of gold is identical, so you can always exchange one
gram of gold for another.

You can’t say the same for Bitcoin. A Bitcoin may become tainted through money laundering or
other illegal activity. Because you can track Bitcoin to its source, some vendors may not accept
the tainted Bitcoin, placing a lower value on it than an untainted one.

15|Page
PRCY© — Whitepaper V 1.0
Fungibility brings reliability to a currency, and without a certain level of it, the currency won’t
survive. Why would you keep a currency if you’re not confident that it’ll be accepted when you

spend it?
A privacy coin has no transaction history, so it can never become tainted. Privacy coins maintain

your anonymity, but even better, they guarantee the fungibility that a currency needs to stand
the test of time.

BF TOKEN
(BFT)

BNK TO THE FUTURE’S FUTURE VISION

BnK To The Future’s next goal is to give our investors the opportunity to trade their equity by launching a compli-

ance-driven, Blockchain based trading market for buying and selling the most valuable companies in the Bitcoin,

Blockchain and FinTech sector. It is also launching the BF Token (BFT), a membership and rewards token to

create a fairer, more transparent and efficient marketplace on BnKToTheFuture.com. The team aims to support

the growth of companies and technologies involved in the future of finance in a more decentralized, yet compli-

ance-driven way.

THE MARKET OPPORTUNITY

01. Fintech and blockchain companies have experienced explosive growth in recent years. Examining and vet-

ting each company that wants to be listed on the BnKToTheFuture.com platform has become difficult to achieve

in a timely, efficient and thorough manner through our current fully centralized approach.

O02. Under the current infrastructure, it is difficult to provide efficient, real-time company updates to investors

who want to stay informed of the latest news on their investments.

03. The industry is facing both increased scrutiny and regulatory challenges. Any blockchain solution must

maintain compliance with securities laws under various jurisdictions. We are a registered securities business with

ownership stakes in other licensed companies including a U.S. broker-dealer and an SEC registered Alternative

Trading System (ATS) amongst others.

WHAT ARE
BF TOKENS (BFT)?

BFT is a due diligence-driven membership and
rewards token. It effectively addresses the key
challenges to create a transparent and

efficient scalable marketplace.

WHY THE BF TOKEN?

By incentivizing the crypto community to
engage in due diligence, BFT provides a
scalable system for identifying, listing and
trading top companies in the industry. It also
enables fast and efficient facilitation of a live
secondary market environment with

information updated in real-time.

HOW DOES BFT WORK?

01. BFT facilitates a more decentralized
process for listing investment opportunities

on the BnkToTheFuture.com platform.

02. BFT creates a community-enhanced due
diligence process for deals listed on the
BnkToTheFuture.com platform

whereby token holders identify, select and
research the best deals in the industry for a

more streamlined process.

03. BFT incentivizes token holders (both
community and companies on the platform)
to provide frequent and real-time investor

updates for greater transparency.

BFT BENEFITS FOR
TOKEN HOLDERS

Token holders cannot invest in companies
through the platform without qualifying as
investors; however, the BF tokens provide VIP
access to certain portions of the platform
previously open only to investors to earn
tokens by providing due diligence support,
deal-flow selection and investor updates.

Play. Create. Own. Govern. Earn.

Welcome to the Metaverse

The Sandbox team is building a unique virtual world where players can build, own, and monetize
their gaming experiences using SAND, the main utility token of the platform.

SAND holders will be also able to participate in governance of the platform via a Decentralized
Autonomous Organization (DAO), where they can exercise voting rights on key decisions of The
Sandbox ecosystem. As a player, you can create digital assets (Non-Fungible Tokens, aka NFTs),
upload them to the marketplace, and drag-and-drop them to create game experiences with The
Sandbox Game Maker. The Sandbox has secured over 50 partnerships including Atari, Crypto Kitties,
and Shaun the Sheep to build a fun, creative “play-to-earn” Gaming platform, owned and made by
players. The Sandbox aims to bring blockchain into mainstream gaming, attracting both crypto and
non-crypto game enthusiasts by offering the advantages of true-ownership, digital scarcity,
monetization capabilities, and interoperability

1. Executive Summary

SANDBOX:

~~

The Sandbox is a virtual world where players can build, own, and monetize their gaming experiences
in the Ethereum blockchain using SAND, the platform’s utility token.

Our vision is to offer a deeply immersive metaverse in which players will create virtual worlds and
games collaboratively and without central authority. We are aiming to disrupt the existing game
makers like Minecraft and Roblox by providing creators true ownership of their creations as
non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and rewarding their participation with our utility token — SAND.

In the current game market, the centralized ownership and control of user-generated content limits
creator rights and ownership. Central control over the trading of virtual goods created by players
restricts them from generating fair value for their creations. Compounding this, it can be difficult to
prove creative ownership of works, especially as content is copied, altered, and built upon.

With The Sandbox, we aim to overcome these limitations while accelerating blockchain adoption to
grow the blockchain gaming market. We will do this by building a voxel gaming platform where
creators are able to craft, play, share, collect, and trade without central control, enjoying secure
copyright ownership with the ability to earn cryptocurrency (SAND). This copyright ownership will be
established and guaranteed through the use of NFTs, where every in-game item will have a unique
and immutable blockchain identifier.
WHITEPAPER SANDBOR:

1.1. A User-Generated Content Ecosystem

The Sandbox gaming ecosystem consists of three integrated products that together provide a
comprehensive experience for user-generated content (UGC) content production.

VOXEL EDITOR MARKETPLACE GAME MAKER
www.voxedit.io www.sandbox.game/shop www.sandbox.game/play
A. VOXEDIT: This simple to use yet powerful free 3D voxel modelling package allows users to

create and animate 3D objects such as people, animals, foliage, and tools, and export them
into The Sandbox marketplace to become game ASSETS.

B. MARKETPLACE: The Sandbox’s web-based marketplace allows users to upload, publish, and
sell their creations (ASSETS) made in VoxEdit, as Tokens (Both ERC-721 and ERC-1155
tokens).

C. GAME MAKER: Anyone who owns ASSETS, either by making them in VoxEdit or purchasing

them, can utilize them with the third and most important ecosystem product, the Game
Maker and the Game itself. This product, when launched in Game Maker mode, enables
users to place and use their ASSETS within a piece of LAND (an ERC-721 token) that they can
own in the virtual world. Users can decorate their LAND with ASSETS, and more importantly,
implement interesting and nuanced gameplay mechanics by assigning predefined behaviors
to the ASSETS through visual scripting nodes, turning a LAND from a decoration experience
into a potential full game experience.

WHITEPAPER SANDBOH:

1.2. Blockchain Gaming with NFTs

The Sandbox virtual world uses blockchain technology and NFTs to empower the players and
creators. NFTs are an emerging segment in the global game market: virtual tokens for digital scarcity,
security and authenticity. Each NFT is distinct or unique, it is indivisible and it is not interchangeable
for another.

Fungible Non-fungible

E.g., John Lennon Limited

Eg One UsiPollar Edition Postage Stamps

Interchangeable Not interchangeable
Uniform (all are the same) Distinct or unique
Divisible Indivisible

Comparison of Fungible versus Non-fungible Tokens

Through the use of NFTs, The Sandbox users will be able to benefit from:

A. TRUE DIGITAL OWNERSHIP: Gamers are the true and perpetual owners of their digital items,
even if the game was shut down or abandoned. With blockchain, every game item can be
tokenized, allowing gamers to decide how they want to trade, sell, or gift their items.

D. SECURITY AND IMMUTABILITY: Digital game items can be easily tokenized and traded in
primary and secondary markets that are managed and facilitated by blockchain technology.
Items based on scarcity and demand usually invite fraud and theft, but these risks are
minimised on blockchain because it is a distributed ledger.

E. TRADING: Blockchain-based gaming platforms can provide users with ultimate control over
their digital assets. They can buy and sell items freely without concern that they will be
ripped off or that a platform will close and cancel all the value of their in-game items.

F. CROSS-APPLICATION INTEROPERABILITY: Blockchain provides capacity for games to utilize
shared assets. ASSETS, avatars, LANDS and any other game elements can be used in other
games that allow it. These game items are no longer confined by a narrow digital ecosystem.

The Sandbox metaverse uses several tokens to create a circular economy between all the profiles of
users who will interact with its platform namely the players, creators, curators and LAND owners.
These are the LANDS, ASSETS and SAND, a token based on the ERC20 protocol which will act as the
official currency in the ecosystem when purchasing goods and services within the game marketplace
(amongst other rights).

THE
WHITEPAPER SANDBOR:-

1.3. What is SAND and what is it used for?

SAND is an essential part of The Sandbox platform and The Sandbox are working on establishing key
mechanics that makes it intrinsically tied to The Sandbox platform and its value. SAND is an ERC-20
utility token built on the Ethereum blockchain that serves as the basis for transactions within The
Sandbox, and has the following uses:

e Access The Sandbox platform: Players spend SAND in order to play games, buy equipment,
or customize their Avatar character—and can potentially collect SAND through gameplay.
Creators spend SAND to acquire ASSETS, LANDS, and through Staking. LAND Sales drive
demand for SAND to purchase LANDS. Artists spend SAND to upload ASSETS to the
Marketplace and buy Gems for defining Rarity and Scarcity.

e@ Governance: SAND is a governance token that allows holders to participate in Governance
decisions of the platform, using a DAO structure. They can exercise voting rights on key
elements such as Foundation grant attributions to content and game creators and feature
prioritisation on the platform Roadmap. SAND owners can vote themselves or delegate
voting rights to other players of their choice.

e Staking: SAND allows for staking, which allows for passive revenues on LANDS: you get more
SAND by staking it. This is also the only way to get valuable Gems and Catalysts, needed for
ASSET creation.

e Fee Capture model = 5% of all transaction volume carried out in SAND tokens (Transaction
Fees) shall be allocated with 50% to the Staking Pool as rewards for token holders that Stake
SAND tokens and 50% to the "Foundation."

e@ Foundation: The role of the Foundation is to support the ecosystem of The Sandbox,
offering grants to incentivize high quality content & game production on the platform. To
date, the Foundation has funded over 15 game projects and granted 100 artists to produce
NFTs ahead of the public Launch in December 2020. The overall valuation of the metaverse
grows through the valuation of all games funded by the Foundation, creating a virtuous
circle to enable funding bigger games.

1.4. What do we plan next?

We have a strong product roadmap ahead and a top team to execute a strong vision to build a
unique virtual world gaming platform where players can build, own, and monetize their gaming
experiences and spread the power of blockchain as the lead technology in the gaming industry. All
these together with what we have achieved so far resulted in TSB being awarded a recognition as
the most expected blockchain game in 2020.

www.sandbox.game
THE
WHITEPAPER SANDBOR:-

https://www. blockchaingamer.biz/news/12585/blockchain-game-sentiment-positive-the-sandbox-m
ost-anticipated/

In the short term, we are launching the fourth LAND presale and Game Maker. This will be
complemented with the SAND public launch. As such, we expect to have SAND available for
individuals and corporations in order to increase liquidity and availability of it with the main purpose
to collaborate with the community growth and ecosystem flow.

In relation to the proposed SAND offering, the community of creators and players will need to get
access to SAND. We plan to make it accessible to the community through multiple ways with
controllable supply mechanisms, such as purchasing SAND from multiple exchanges.

As the community increases in terms of the number of creators, players and ASSETS exchanged in
the marketplace, there might be an increased need for SAND within the ecosystem. Therefore, while
the total supply of SAND is fixed, the initial amount of SAND offered will provide a scarcity effect
reducing the SAND available per capita and therefore fostering demand.

1.5. Associated challenges and risks

It is the responsibility of any purchaser of SAND to inform themselves of, and to observe and comply
with, all applicable laws and regulations of any relevant jurisdiction. Prospective purchasers for any
SAND shall be expected to consider the risk factors identified in this section. If any of the indicated
risks were to materialize, then they could have a negative impact on the Issuer’s finances and
operational performance which can hinder the ability of the Issuer to fulfil its obligations under this
whitepaper.

The challenges and risks are identified by the board of administration of the Issuer as at the date of
registration of this whitepaper. This does not exclude the possibility of there being other risk threats
and the purchaser must be aware that the impact on the Issuer may be heightened due to a
combination of several risks materializing simultaneously.

One of the main challenges in the project is the rate of adoption of the community of artists and
creators to start exchanging assets, which will be a key point behind the demand generation of
SAND. As such, we are focused in developing a strong, multi-platform product that can spread
massively by offering a tool to create voxel art that is focused on solving problems and community
needs. We are therefore developing strong communities in different areas of the world with a strong
focus in Asia, where we believe the rate of adoption and learning curve will be steeper. The project
success rate will be dependent upon the priority and preference of consumers and its ability to
swiftly anticipate, identify and capitalise upon these priorities and preferences.

The Issuer operates in an emerging and disruptive industry that is under rapid and dynamic
development. This includes, but is not limited to, the developments relating to the business itself,
the underlying technology, and the regulatory and legal implications thereof. Specifically, in relation
to public knowledge and understanding of emerging technologies, such distributed ledger
technologies, smart contracts and other innovative technology arrangements, are still limited as at
the date of registration of this whitepaper. The risks arising out of such may not be fully
comprehended as of yet and new additional risks may arise in the future.

As the Issuer’s undertaking is reliant on the continuous and proper functioning of its technology
infrastructure, the Issuer is subject to a variety of risks relating to the proper maintenance thereof.

www.sandbox.game
WHITEPAPER SANDBOR:
gf

These risks include, but are not limited to, cyber-attacks, data theft or other unauthorised use of
data, and other malicious interferences. Certain parts of the infrastructure may be outsourced to
third parties. In such cases, the Issuer is reliant upon technology arrangements developed by such
third parties for the running of its undertaking, and it is exposed to the risk of failures in such
technology arrangements.

The Issuer is subject to various laws, including regulations and rules issued thereunder, and is at risk
in relation to changes in the laws and the timing and effects of changes in the respective legislation.
This includes changes in the interpretation thereof which cannot be predicted by the Issuer.

The growth of the Issuer and its undertaking is partially attributable to the efforts and abilities of the
members of its management team and other key personnel, particularly its board of administration.
If one or more of the members of this team were unable or unwilling to continue in their present
position, the Issuer might not be able to replace them within a short time, which could in turn have a
material adverse effect on the Issuer’s business.

The Sandbox combines the large, active and enthusiastic franchise audience with a richer
gaming environment based on a new 3D voxel” engine, and the revolutionary ability of
blockchain integration with NFTs. to offer players creative and financial control of the
content they make.

3. The Sandbox Platform

3.1. Mission

The Sandbox team’s mission is to build a system where creators will be able to craft, play,
share, and trade without central control, enjoying secure copyright ownership with the
ability to earn SAND.

The Sandbox team believes these innovations are important, for while the current market for
voxel-based creation games already has 500,000,000 Creators and 160,000,000 MAUs, it
suffers from four key problems that could hinder future growth if not addressed:

e The centralization of user-generated content in dominant titles such as Minecraft
and Roblox limits creator rights and ownership;

e Central control over the trading of virtual goods created by players restricts players
from generating fair value for their creations, limiting what they can or cannot sell
and/or taking a significant portion of the sales revenue;

e@ Given the nature of voxel art, it can be difficult to prove creative ownership of works,
especially as content is copied, altered and built upon; and

e Existing game marketplaces are based on fiat currencies, which do not support true
microtransactions and are vulnerable to credit card fraud that can unbalance in-game
economies.

1 Voxels, or volume pixels, are analogous to 3D pixels, with each voxel representing a value on a defined grid in three-dimensional

space

2 Non-fungible items are unique and cannot be replaced by another equal part or quantity, as explained in this article:

3.2. Game Overview

At its core, The Sandbox is an ecosystem for Players and Creators, consisting of three main
components: a Voxel Editor (named “VoxEdit”), a Marketplace, and the Game itself.

The Sandbox offers a unique way to create, assemble, and share 3D voxel models. We empower
Creators with intuitive, powerful content creation tools. You can make your own 3D voxel objects,
animate them, and publish/sell them in our worldwide marketplace. VoxEdit is our 3D tool that
allows anyone to create or import their own voxel objects, work on them, and effortlessly export
them to the marketplace where users can turn them into limited ERC-1155 tokens called ASSETS.
ASSETS are virtual tokens for digital scarcity, security and authenticity. They are unique/limited as
well as distinct and indivisible.

Blockchain allows creators to have true ownership and thanks to this technology we, in our capacity
as developers, can finally reward players for their time and the hard work they put into content
creation, allowing them to monetize and freely trade their ASSETS.

Our ASSET smart contract allows content to become the new platform, creating a new paradigm.
This is because they offer multiple uses and are not confined to a single game. This "second-layer
programmability" gives any developer the power to bring a lasting and ever-growing value to the
ASSETS, which can be shared cross-games, cross-platforms and cross-chains.

The Marketplace is the trading environment for ASSETS, where they can be given away for free or
sold to other PLAYERS.

The Game is the overall game system where playable experiences can be enjoyed and shared. In the
Game, not only can creators profit from their creations, players can play-to-earn by collecting
resources, rewards, and tokens.

3.3. LAND and the LANDS Map

LANDS are blockchain-backed virtual tokens (using the ERC-721 standard for NFTs) representing
physical parcels of The Sandbox Metaverse. They allow players to own a portion of the Metaverse
and thus be able to host content (ASSETS and GAMES).

The Sandbox Metaverse is based on a map of 166,464 LANDS (408*408). LANDS are physical spaces
in the Metaverse owned by players to create and monetize Games. LANDS are used to publish your
game and can be rented to game creators. Every LAND comes with a set of prebuilt terrains, but it
can be terraformed and modified by the USER who owns it (or other PLAYERS they invite to work on
it).

In the future, players will be able to combine LANDS together to form ESTATES In the future,
ESTATES will have the potential to be owned by multiple players to form DISTRICTS.

3.4. Avatar

An AVATAR is an in-game voxel representation of a player, which may be modified piece by piece by
the owner. An avatar has certain specifications and format and comes with a default set of
animations such as walking, running, jumping and fighting. Specifically, this avatar will be modifiable
piece by piece (helmet, arms, torso, legs, etc.) by equipping it with different compatible ASSET
tokens.

3.5. SAND

SAND is an essential part of The Sandbox platform and we are working on establishing key
mechanics that makes it intrinsically tied to The Sandbox platform and its value. SAND is an ERC-20
utility token built on the Ethereum blockchain that serves as the basis for transactions within The

Sandbox, and has the following uses:

e Access The Sandbox platform: Players spend SAND in order to play games, buy
equipment, or customize their Avatar character. Creators spend SAND to acquire ASSETS,
LANDS, and through Staking. LAND Sales drive demand for SAND to purchase LANDS.
Artists spend SAND to upload ASSETS to the Marketplace and buy Gems for defining Rarity
and Scarcity.

e@ Governance: SAND is a governance token that allows holders to participate in Governance
decisions of the platform, using a DAO structure. They can exercise voting rights on key
elements such as Foundation grant attributions to content and game creators and feature
prioritisation on the platform Roadmap. SAND owners can vote themselves or delegate
voting rights to other players of their choice.

e Staking: SAND allows for staking, which allows for passive revenues on LANDS: you get
more SAND by staking it. This is also the only way to get valuable Gems and Catalysts,
needed for ASSET creation

e Fee Capture model = 5% of all transaction volume carried out in SAND tokens (Transaction
Fees) shall be allocated with 50% to the Staking Pool as rewards for token holders that
Stake SAND tokens and 50% to the "Foundation."

e@ Foundation: The role of the Foundation is to support the ecosystem of The Sandbox,
offering grants to incentivize high quality content & game production on the platform. To
date, the Foundation has funded over 15 game projects and granted 100 artists to
produce NFTs ahead of the public Launch in December 2020. The overall valuation of the
metaverse grows through the valuation of all games funded by the Foundation, creating a
virtuous circle to enable funding bigger games.

3.6. SAND Stakeholders

We have developed a 4 Stakeholders approach to ensure that that the success of TSB accrues value
towards the token. Therefore, we will set through smart contracts, that revenues generated through
The Sandbox will be distributed across 4 stakeholders to provide support to the ecosystems of
creators and players as well as to provide the resources needed to grow the market and develop
high quality gaming experiences.

These 4 stakeholders are:

1. Foundation Pool: Is designed to ensure that revenue generated through the game accrues
value to the token. The token allocation of this Foundation pool will be progressively
decentralised as we implement a DAO/Community driven solution towards a decentralized
model for the benefit of the token ecosystem.

2. Staking Pool: Is designed to provide a yield and value to token holders. Its governance will
migrate from a centralized decision on year 1 towards a DAO mechanism in the coming
years. Token holders that are also active players will generate an extra yield rewarding their
activity.

3. | Company Treasury: This represents the SAND that is owned by the company that comes
from the proceeds of sales of company owned assets with a 12 months lock-up. The SAND
generated through this Treasury will be sold back to the market to pay operational
expenses.

4. Company Reserve: This is the initial company reserve of 600mm SAND (20% of total Token

Supply). This reserve will be fed with the proceeds of sales of company owned assets with a
6 month lock-up.

4. Market Overview

The current gaming market presents favorable conditions that offer The Sandbox a unique
opportunity to exploit on both PC/Mac and mobile platforms, as the opportunity to shift power and
earning potential into the hands of players in the growing UGC gaming market will add significant
value to their gameplay experience.

The global gaming market is expected to reach: USD 171.96 billion’ by 2025;

The mobile segment, which is one of The Sandbox’s target platforms, is projected to
gain momentum and exhibit a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.3% over
the coming years, owing to increasing smartphone penetration across the globe ;

e The online segment is estimated to witness substantial growth over the next eight
years, expanding at a CAGR of 8.6% from 2020 to 2025. This can be attributed to
increasing broadband penetration and growing online betting, gambling, and social
network gaming and

e The Asia Pacific market is expected to gain traction, attaining a market size of USD
86.84 billion by 2025. Emerging countries such as China, India and South Korea are
offering lucrative growth opportunities for market augmentation, which can be
partly attributed to growing smartphone and Internet penetration in these countries.

4.1. Gaming Creator Market

The Sandbox team’s mission is to build a system where creators will be able to craft, play,
share, and trade without central control, enjoying secure copyright ownership with the
ability to earn SAND.

The genre of creator games with voxel graphics is dominated by two key industry players,
Minecraft and Roblox. Minecraft, the leader in the category, saw player numbers grow over
30% year on year for the last five years, while Roblox placed sixth in the list of top grossing
iPhone mobile gaming apps in the United States as of January 2018, ranked by daily revenue.
Roblox is estimated to take in over USD 750,000 per day in revenue. Some creators have
reportedly earned over USD 30,000,000° in 2017 from the 70%’ revenue share they receive
from sales inside their own creations.

4.2. Creator Market

A primary challenge facing voxel art creators in the current gaming environment is they have
limited or no legal rights to the intellectual property they create. This can result in artists or
creators spending days or even months creating their in-game worlds while receiving little or
no financial benefit.

Another hurdle facing players is establishing creative ownership of their works, especially if
another player or entity copies the original work, modifies it or builds on it. Without a system
for identifying and tracking the ownership of an item from first creation, it’s almost
impossible to tell if work is original or copied.

Lastly, the common reliance on fiat currencies and credit card transactions means the
element of credit card fraud is never far away. Currently, the ratio of illegitimate transactions
in games can be as high as one out of every 7.5 items sold as the result of credit card fraud,
potentially disrupting the entire in-game economy.

By registering every ASSET created as an NFT, The Sandbox allows creators true ownership of
everything they create. Creators retain copyright and ownership of everything they create
and can sell and trade items while receiving all the benefits for their work. As transactions
are made via blockchain in Ethereum, credit card fraud is eliminated. Aside from addressing
all of these issues, The Sandbox aims to bring even more value to the crafted items of
CREATORS. For the first time ever, CREATORS will be able to see how their uploaded ASSETS
come to life when they see them used in a LAND as part of great experiences.

4.3. Player Market

Issues such as ownership or compensation are of less concern to players who primarily come
to games to play and buy items rather than create and sell them. However, another issue
directly affects these players is that they spend real-world money to buy items in-game, but
they have no way to recover this money.

For instance, if they stop playing a game, all the items they bought in it immediately become
worthless. If the game is shut down for any reason, such as a decline in popularity that
makes it less profitable, all the player’s in-game purchases vanish into nothing. This is
especially true in free-to-play (F2P) games. Purchases are a one-way street. Players spend
money to buy things in the game, but have no way to recover their value if they no longer
use an item, and have no way to sell it to another player legally so they receive no
compensation if the game is taken off the market.

4.4. Market Solution

The game’s player-centric innovations and improvements over current titles in the market
make it probable that The Sandbox can expand its audience beyond the 40,000,000 players
who have downloaded previous versions of The Sandbox and the game’s current 1,200,000
MAUs.

The first stage of this process is the creation of a semi-decentralized gaming community with
some elements under the central control of The Sandbox and other elements decentralized
to the creators and players themselves.

Gameplay Experience

The gaming experience on the new The Sandbox platform will be launched through several
intermediary phases, with increasingly more complex features in each. When the alpha version is
launched, players will be able to make transactions and store their digital voxel ASSETS while also
playing and interacting with other voxel asset creators and players in different user generated

www.sandbox.game Page 25
WHITEPAPER SANDBOX:

worlds. The gaming experience will make The Sandbox a strong blockchain-based alternative to
existing platforms such as Minecraft and Roblox.

Even for players who do not create discrete items to sell on the UGC store, the combination of
creativity and security can pay off for players who create LANDS with compelling attractions. This is
because a LAND might have different revenue streams implemented on it, like microtransactions.
Additionally, players can play-to-earn by collecting rewards through gameplay.

We expect a wide variety of audiences to enjoy gaming experiences in The Sandbox marketplace. We
have identified some of the types of games creators will be able to craft for them:

e Social Experiences: The ASSET marketplace will allow creators to fully decorate their
spaces with beautiful sceneries and structures such as a fairy wonderland, a
medieval town, or even a futuristic space station.

These types of experiences can attract communities of in-game friends that hang out
for activities that combine social and gameplay elements.

e Build & Craft: Our voxel map is ideal for creators to make Building & Crafting
experiences. Creators will be able to facilitate players with interesting experiences
like building competitions, creating their own play spaces.

All these tools and mechanics will be able to interact with the terrain to modify it,
build over it or even completely destroy it.

e Exploration & Adventure: Solve the mystery of the cursed swamp, slay the

mercenary king of the endless desert, help the rebellion of the exiled prince of the
elder LANDS or even discover all the hidden secrets of the ancient temple!

www.sandbox.game Page 26
THE
WHITEPAPER SANDBOR:-
Rd

Creators will be able to bring narrative, exploration and adventure gameplay to their
LAND. Each new LAND will be different, offering new potential to discover new
LANDS, meet new people and discover never before seen secrets!

6.2. Map - LANDS

The persistent map determines a player’s specific LAND coordinate. In most blockchain games where
player domains are sold like real estate, the specific location of a domain is of paramount importance
as it will determine who and what you are next to. Similarly, in The Sandbox there is a finite amount
of LANDS, and their location is determined initially in the map, and cannot be moved from one
coordinate of the world map to the other.

There are several advantages to this structure:

e Players have the agency to combine LANDS to create a bigger gaming space with and
near their friends; and

e Friends can cooperate in the creation of these larger experiences by building
experiences together within the combined LAND and thus sharing the rewards
(whether financial or purely social or artistic).

There is also an economic incentive for players to work together via a combined LAND. For instance,
if several players band together they can create a ‘theme park’ experience, with each member
focusing on a key attraction, or members can focus on distinct neighborhoods that together create a
‘city’ experience. In each case, the team effort allows players to cooperatively create a stronger
incentive for players to visit and enjoy their creations—and more visits results in more revenue to be
shared.

It’s true that a single player with one LAND can keep all the revenue from that LAND, but a larger,
more diverse collection of LANDS combined can boost financial rewards to be shared by charging, for
example, for a SUPER PASS that allows a player to visit all the gaming experiences in a combined
LAND, with the revenue from the SUPER PASS shared between all the owners of said LAND.

There will be limits on joining LANDS together to keep certain conglomerations from having too
much control and power against solo players.

Recent information has been released on The Sandbox Transportation System.

6.3. ASSETS Marketplace

The marketplace will use smart contracts to control item auctions and transactions. This open
marketplace for creators and developers will allow for the free trade of in-game assets between the
platform users. Additional benefits of this marketplace are that economic principles of supply and
demand become automatically integrated into the system, allowing the community to determine the

www.sandbox.game

fair price of user-generated ASSETS. The true strength of this marketplace, however, is that creators
of such ASSETS can finally generate true tangible real-world value from the voxel content they create.

SHOP

a1 500)

The ASSET tokens in our marketplace will require several pieces of information in order to properly
be displayed as a sellable good. These pieces of info are:

Name & Genre: In order to better identify the ASSET being sold, and to help
potential buyers in finding it in the marketplace, the ASSET will require a name anda
genre;

Description: The description will help creators add specifications like size, model,
potential uses or even attach a short piece of fictional lore to the ASSET;

Thumbnail: The marketplace will show what the ASSET itself looks like via several
thumbnails of the ASSET. We will include a feature in our voxel editor that will
automatically generate these thumbnails for the creators;

Price: The creator will have total control over the price the ASSET will have on the
marketplace. This price will be set in SAND.

Value: Creators will define Rarity, Scarcity and Attributes thanks to the Gems &
Catalysts system.

Once all these requirements are met, the ASSET will be successfully displayed on the marketplace
and be available for purchase.

www.sandbox.game Page 28
THE
WHITEPAPER SANDBOR:-

6.4. VoxEdit

Under the philosophy of “CREATE, ANIMATE, PLAY” VoxEdit is the voxel modeling software that
allows the artist to rig models and animate them using a user-friendly keyframe interpolation
timeline.

e@ Modeling: Having other software that also lets you model your own voxel art — what
makes the modeling in VoxEdit different is that it is aimed at artists. That commodity
is thanks to a user-friendly interface, powerful tools to let the artists model anything
they want, but also stay connected with them all the time to hear their feedback,
what would be nice to have, and especially what would make their life using VoxEdit
much easier.

e Animation: Here is where VoxEdit stands out. VoxEdit uses a skeletal system with
hierarchies, like the ones used in professional 3D software like Maya, 3D Max,
Cinema 4D, etc, allowing the Artist to rig anything they want and be ready for
animation. It is the only voxel modeling software that allows to model AND animate
your ASSETS.

Once the skeleton is made, the artist can create any type of animation moving the
different parts of their model with an easy-to-use timeline. The timeline works like a
video editing software timeline, using layers to represent what part of the model you
are moving and creating key-frames to set the position, rotation and scale. The
magic happens thanks to the interpolation of these key-frames that the timeline
does in the background.

e Exporting:
VoxEdit allows the artist to export their creation in .VXM and .VXR, formats that our
Marketplace and games use to create a super smooth communication between the
three parts. Besides that, it also lets export in the standard formats such as .OBJ and
also .DAE and .GLTF for the models with animations on it.

7. Economy

We are excited by the opportunity to build new kinds of business models with this player-powered
economy, both in terms of revenue model and token model.

SAND will provide immediate liquidity to players and investors. The valuation of the SAND token is
calculated on what players will be able to build/play/trade/win inside our metaverse. We are aiming
at replicating real-world economy systems, with players able to buy, rent, hire, vote, stake, etc.

The main flows of income will be the following:

www.sandbox.game
THE
WHITEPAPER SANDBOR:-
Rd

e Company ASSETs token: Sales of ASSETS created and developed by the company
(LANDS, ASSETS, Attributes, others);

e Transaction Fees: TSB to charges 5% of all transaction volume carried out in SAND
tokens (Transaction Fees) to be allocated 50% to the Staking Pool as rewards for
token holders that Stake SAND tokens and 50% to the "Foundation."

e Player Subscription Fees: Revenues that we will generate via various subscription
models to gain access to exclusive in-game features, Premium ASSETS etc.

7.1. Tokenomics

SAND is the utility token used throughout The Sandbox ecosystem as the basis of transactions and
interactions. It is an ERC-20 utility token built on the Ethereum blockchain. It will be used across the
ecosystem by gamers, developers, and publishers, allowing Creators and Players to exchange ASSETS
and Games and build a user-based platform of rewards while developing an ecosystem where
Creators and Players will share various truly unique gaming experiences.

User generated digital ASSETS are represented as ERC-1155 tokens. To ensure the everlasting scarcity
and verifiable scarcity of non-fungible items, we use the ERC-1155 token standard. This standard
allows a smart contract to track token-ownership at the individual token level: each item has a
unique identifier and, optionally, unique properties stored as metadata.

SAND can be used and acquired by Artists, Creators, Players and LAND Owners through
multiple ways as described below:

e Players:

Playing: Players will be able to earn SAND tokens while playing the different games
uploaded to The Sandbox ecosystem. They might win SAND by slaying a legendary
monster, opening a chest, or even completing a quest; nearly endless possibilities
can be created in games;

Skill-Based Challenge: Players will be able to pay an entry fee to enter a challenge
such as a race, a card game, a battle royale, or any other type of competitive contest.
The winner takes all of the prize pool. The experience creator might take a % of the
total pool for creating and hosting the experience; and

Tips System: A player who also happens to be a streamer, might be tipped with small
amounts of SAND based on his performance either for entertaining his audience or
by being good at whichever game he or she is playing.

e Creators:

ASSET Sales Revenue: Creators will be able to sell their assets in the marketplace,
receiving 100% of the SAND price of the ASSET;

In-Game Purchases: Experience creators will be able to set up many different
monetization systems that will let them charge players SAND for exclusive content.
These monetization techniques range from item purchases to stat boosters,
subscriptions, or even entry fees to the game itself;

Creators Fund: At the first stages of the ecosystem, we will have a rewards program

to incentivize creators to fill the marketplace with amazing voxel creations and in
return be rewarded with a generous sum of SAND tokens;

www.sandbox.game
WHITEPAPER SANDBOX:
CA

Art Challenges: We intend to keep a community-centered focus towards the
marketplace, and with that in mind we decided that we will hold art challenges in
which creators will be able to upload one of their ASSETS for the possibility to win a
prize pool of SAND tokens if their ASSET received the most votes from the
community; and

Crowdfunded Requests: We shall enable a section of the marketplace that allows

individuals and groups of users to request a certain type of ASSET in exchange for a
payment of SAND, contributed by all the requesters.

The flow of SAND within the ecosystem could be represented as follows:

TSB has also generated its first LAND presales successfully during December 2019 and July 2020. All
LAND assigned for sale have been sold for over 6,000 ETH.

7.3. Initial Exchange Offering

TSB is aiming to raise around USD 3,000,000 during the public sale, through the allocation of 12% of
the total supply of SAND. There shall not be a soft cap and therefore there will be no refunds made
of funds contributed towards the project and allocated as detailed below:

Grow the development team and infrastructure for the game platform 45%
Marketing — Creators acquisition and IP licences for NFT developments 45%
Security, Legal and Compliance Expenses 7%
General and Administrative Expenses 3%

Investors for SAND include, but are not limited to:

Traditional Venture Capital;
Cryptocurrency Investors;
Gaming Companies;
Gamers;

Game Developers

7.4. Other Dynamics

As the community increases in terms of the number of creators, players and ASSETS in the
marketplace, there will be an increase in the need for a utility token to reward the growing number
of stakeholders participating in the platform.

e@ Growth Model and KPIs

The key success factors for building the ecosystem consist of ensuring an organic
community growth of Creators and Players invested in the value proposition offered
by The Sandbox while ensuring customer satisfaction. In order to ensure a
progressive growth of the community and its model, we have identified key variables
that will be measured and incentivized through marketing, promotional, and
communication tactics to ensure the growth of the ecosystem:

Creators growth rate;

Players growth rate;

New Assets created and uploaded per Creator;

New Assets created and uploaded by TSB;

Assets sold per month created by Creators;

Assets sold per month created by TSB;

Inflation rate of Assets in the marketplace;

Average price per Asset developed by Creators (in SAND);
Average price per Asset developed by TSB (in SAND);
Asset price growth;

Initial supply of SAND;

Initial supply of SAND in the hands of Creators and Players;
Price of SAND (in USD or ETH);

oooo0o00000000

o % Commission at the marketplace.

Therefore, while the total supply of SAND is fixed, the initial amount of SAND offered to
the ecosystem through creators and players will be limited to add a scarcity effect due
to the following key factors:

o Agrowing number of Creators and Players which eventually
will reduce the SAND available per capita; and
o Staking effect, increasing the time holding SAND.

8. Technology

Blockchain technology is used to record ownership of tokens and allow owners to transfer/sell/use
them without restriction. IPFS is used to store the actual digital asset and ensure the asset cannot be
changed without owner permission.

Three different blockchain protocols will be integrated into The Sandbox gaming stack:

e@ ERC-20 for SAND; and
e ERC-1155 and ERC-721 for the Digital Assets storage and trading.

8.1. Future Technology Integrations

Why are we using Ethereum? We found many benefits to do so as detailed below:

e Ease of use: Ethereum has been built with flexibility in mind, which perfectly fits our
use case with Asset tokens. Ethereum also has the largest number of developers,
which allows for well-established standards, best practices and support;

e Robustness: It is, as of today, among the most robust blockchain protocols: its wide
adoption makes the network validated by many and thus more secure; and

e Interoperability: Ethereum is a protocol, a base layer on top of which all applications
can build and interact with each other.

The main issue faced by Ethereum today is often said to be its scaling issue. Blockchains are based on
three pillars: Security, Decentralization and Scalability (throughput). Historically, Ethereum always
put security and decentralization first, at the cost of scalability and some _ technological
improvements need to be made at the base layer to support traffic at scale. On most public
blockchains like Ethereum, this is one of the main current concerns, and lots of efforts are in progress
to solve those scaling issues, without sacrificing the blockchain trilemma.

Ethereum is a blockchain that has been proven by thousands of dApps and developers for its
robustness and offering a large ecosystem, resources and support from developers. With the current

www.sandbox.game
THE
WHITEPAPER SANDBOR:-
Rd

system we are building, escrow less auctions, meta transaction, subscriptions (&cie) we can offer a
great experience on Ethereum for non-crypto users

The Sandbox team is looking at layer-2 solutions (that use the main ethereum chain as an anchor for
security) — at the moment they are not yet ready for implementation or have not reached a
production stage so that we could reliably integrate them. We will closely follow technical progresses
on this topic and decide to integrate the solution that combines the best advantages for our product,
use-case and users.

8.2. Multiple Class Fungible Token (MCFT)

At The Sandbox, we spend a lot of time looking at how to preserve security and integrity for ASSETS
on the blockchain while still allowing the speed and flexibility that players and creators demand. As
with many aspects of game design, you can’t get everything you want easily, so it’s a matter of
balancing elements to implement the best solution

The ERC-1155 standard that we co-created with other game companies in the blockchain space, was
designed to support the management of millions of tokens. On top of that our ASSET contract is also
ERC-721 compliant and allows multiple unique items to be created by a single smart contract with
the benefit of keeping the ERC-721 interface to allow interoperability with other Marketplaces and
games

In The Sandbox, users will have full control over their ASSETS, by being able to create them, but also
having the possibility to buy, sell, and trade those same ASSETS in The Sandbox Marketplace using
our SAND token currency.

8.2.1. Interoperability

As we use Ethereum as the substrate of our ERC-1155/ERC721 implementation, any platform
/ wallet that supports ERC-1155/ERC-721 will be able to inspect and use our ASSET. This
means independent developers could rely on the plethora of ASSETS our players will be

creating.

The Sandbox gaming environment will be divided into 5 types of tokens:

SAND (our game currency used across the system)

LANDS (Worlds in which players play that are created by the community)
ASSETS (Voxel models created by players and traded in the marketplace)
GEMS burnt to give attributes to ASSETS. They are ERC20 tokens

CATALYSTS burnt to mint ASSETS. Depending on their power, they allow users to associate
a certain number of GEMS to an ASSET. They are ERC20 tokens

Figure: The Sandbox Tokens

Token contracts are responsible for:

Keeping track of creator (the address that minted the token)
ownership

transfers

Emitting events when the state changes

8.2.2. Meta Transactions

The Sandbox is aiming to bring non-crypto users to the blockchain world. In order to achieve that we
believe that the system should be transparent to the user as much as possible.
Meta Transactions allow users that own SAND to interact with our platform without the need to own

or know what ETH is or for that matter any of the tokens that will be used.

8.3. Technology Solution Breakdown

The Sandbox platform architecture is composed of several components. In terms of
blockchain integration, we have a traditionally backend running on the cloud (currently using
AWS) to support our web frontend. An S3 bucket is used to store the asset of the artist
before they get minted. While we currently guarantee the privacy of the artist work (to
protect their work from being copied prior to minting), we envision later a system that

would prevent even us to peek at the artist work pre-minting.

Once an UGC asset is minted, our backend releases the ASSET on IPFS so that it becomes
public. Our smart contract records the hash of an ASSET so that the owner of the ASSET will
always be able to prove ownership of not only the number recorded on the blockchain
(which many projects in the blockchain gaming space stop there) but also the voxel model

itself as well as the various render.

The backend is being developed with Node.js, which manages the creation of an asset on
$3, generating a Hash ID for that ASSET, which is sent back to the frontend so it can begin
the transaction with the smart contract.

e Finally, once the transaction is confirmed we released the asset on the ipds network.

8.4. Program Agents

The Sandbox platform architecture includes a server on our AWS infrastructure that is monitoring
the blockchain and registering change of state.

Changes are then propagated by our API into our backend, and our centralized database is updating
its records, so that the frontend can pull the recent changes and display them accordingly to the
players and users of The Sandbox platforms.

These changes of states include transfer of ownerships from the tokens (LANDS, ASSETS, or SAND).

Additionally, the following are the various situations that will trigger external data inputs to our
smart contracts. The data received in inputs is always sanitized and several security layers are
implemented to make sure these are protected. Our smart contracts have been duly audited.

e LAND Sale Setup: we submit the LAND configuration to each new sale contract at the
time of deployment.

e LAND Sale: the buyer submits their LAND of choice inclusive of the payment,
following which the contract mints the LAND in exchange. We provide a 2D map to
allow the buyer to easily choose their LAND;

e LAND Sale Stable Price Oracle: We do not have any oracle system that sends
information to our smart contract. Instead we utilise MakerDAO medianizer which
receives updates from the Oracle and makes a median estimation of the price of the
dollar: https://developer.makerdao.com/feeds/

e Asset Sale setup:

othe creator submits a 3D voxel model to our backend, we hash the result and
submit that on the smart contract, that in turn mints a token to represent it;

othe creator submits a signature specifying the selling price and our backend
shall store it;

e Asset Sale: the buyer submits a payment for a particular token to the smart contract
along with the seller signature. It receives the token in exchange.

8.5. Game Engine

We have developed a custom Voxel Engine on top of Unity engine.

Our engine leverages the power of the new Unity Data Oriented Tech Stack (a.k.a. DOTS) by
making extensive use of the Entity Component System (ECS) and the Jobs system.

By using Unity's new Universal Render Pipeline (URP) we are able to support Mobile

platforms in the future, without sacrificing the render quality of our game for Desktop
platforms.

www.sandbox.game
THE
WHITEPAPER SANDBOR:-
Rd

Our engine also implements support for our custom Voxel Models, Rigging and Animation
formats (VXM, VXR, VXA) from our in-house Voxel Editor (VoxEdit).

8.6. Wallets

We minimize the security risk on our backend by reducing the responsibility of hot wallets that are
only used for referral and whitelisting.

The other wallets are cold storage wallets that hold responsibility for updating the platform with new
contracts and new parameters. These could later be part of a governance mechanism.

For these cold wallets, we use a 2 out of 3. multi-signature wallet
(https://github.com/gnosis/MultiSigWallet) and all of the owners of those multi-signatures are three
hardware wallets.

This wallet has the possibility to upgrade our SAND token, as well as the ability to extend
functionality via super operators.

In relation to the methods of payment, if the user wishes to pay with:

e@ an ERC-20 based token (ETH or DAI), it will then be processed by a smart contract on-chain
and the user shall receive the SAND directly into his wallet; and/or

e BTC, credit card or fiat payment, it will then be processed by a third party service merchant
solution, whereby upon confirmation by the latter, the SAND shall be released.

8.7. Security

The Sandbox marketplace is relying on the security of Ethereum for the functioning of its smart
contracts. The only wallet that can affect the logic of our smart contract is our multi-signature wallet
which uses the gnosis MultiSig wallet backed with three hardware wallets.

On our backend side, we manage a database that cache the smart contract events to keep track of
ownership. Our backend also stores temporary assets. On that side, its responsibility is thus minimal.

As for fiat payment hot wallet, we are designing a daily auto-refill to ensure that only a minimum
amount of token is present, minimizing the consequence of a breach.

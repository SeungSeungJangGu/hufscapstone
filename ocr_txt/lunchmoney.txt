Introduction

In the US, customers often complain about poor customer service at
restaurants. Restaurants on the other hand find it hard to retain loyal
customers, scale their business and increase their revenue. According
to restaurant and food marketing research, loyal repeat customers of a
restaurant account for at least 33 percent of the total revenue. While
they may only account for as low as 15 percent of the total customer
base.

With so many emerging and existing restaurant options in the market,
customers have developed very little tolerance for the compromised
service quality at restaurants. Their most common and _ crucial
complaints include poor food quality, poor customer service, finite
menus, lack of healthy options, lack of hygiene, inconsistency in quality,
lack of loyalty incentives and negative feedback from other restaurant
visitors.

To rival these issues, what can be the possible solution for a win-win
situation for customers and restaurant owners?

Enter Restaurant Pl. a blockchain loyalty rewards service for
restaurants and eateries. Customers can submit feedback via the
platform and earn cryptocurrencies. Restaurant owners can post
exclusive deals and discounts on the Restaurant Pl. platform and earn
crypto when their customers accept and redeem their offers.

The Restaurant Pl. platform has been designed for restaurant and
eatery owners who are looking for boosted exposure and increased
customer recognition. According to a Harvard study, by just increasing
the repeat customer rate by as low as 5 percent, the restaurant can
increase their potential profits by 25-125 percent. Hence, Restaurant
Pl’s concept aims at improving the value delivery from food serving
businesses to the customer. Owners can boost their businesses by
improving customer service per the feedback, gain positive
recognition and retain loyal customers.

Problem & the Solution

Problems and customer challenges in the existing restaurant market

Since the success of a restaurant business in the US depends upon the
customer satisfaction level, understanding the problems that the
customers face regularly will help the businesses improve gradually.
Following are some crucial problems and challenges that the
restaurants need to improve upon

* Poor food quality: Customers demand quality in every item that a
restaurant serves. The items should be prepared in hygienic
conditions, must be sumptuous and freshly served. If the order is
poorly prepared, takes too long to be served or arrives cold, the
restaurant is already losing the customer.

* Poor customer service: This is one leading reason as to why
customers never return again to a particular restaurant. The
pointers include long waiting time for a customer, negative
behavior by the staff, not fulfilling specific demands, and lack of
welcoming treatment by the staff.

* Limited menu: Customers are growing more and more health
conscious and want more options on the menu. For example,
gluten-free and organic dishes are high on demand and
restaurants need to adapt healthy options accordingly.

* Lack of cleanliness: This is another crucial insight that many
restaurant owners might overlook. Hygiene and cleanliness should

be the top-most priority for any food vending business. From
cutlery to washrooms, cleanliness must be maintained at all costs.

* Lack of consistency: Loyal customer-base is formed with
consistency in everything a restaurant has to offer For example, if a
customer loves a restaurant's service and food quality, lack of
quality in any of the two aspects will be compromise with his/her
loyalty.

Have you ever asked whether the reviews you're reading are authentic,
or whether they are fake reviews? Sadly, It's not uncommon. for
“oranksters” or consumers that indirectly have a relationship with a
restaurant to post a fake review. These reviews could be negative, or
positive.

In fact, anyone can go on either Google or Yelp, create a free account in
seconds and post any review they wish! Sure, both companies seek to
eliminate issues like this, but there are no defenses in place to stop one
from diminishing a company’s reputation. A negative review by someone
wishing to simply “prank” local businesses and write bad reviews about a
restaurant they've never even been to. Or perhaps a business seeks to
pay people to leave positive reviews, whether they are actually buying
customers or not.

Both cases negatively impact the intrinsic value a business actually
provides. A lawsuit in California illustrates this issue with a local tax
preparer suing a customer who he accuses of leaving a false review. With
Restaurant Pl. this is no longer a problem, and we'll explain how and why.

Another problem with review platforms like Google and Yelp, is that there
isn't a motivating factor for customers to leave a review. Some businesses
falsely try to pay customers to leave reviews, which eventually leads to
review platforms penalizing the business, but not everyone gets caught.
Yelp seeks to provide a platform that only provides reviews from
customers who choose to leave reviews, and penalizes business for even
asking for a customer to leave a review.

The problem with this is that in most cases, only the angry customers
have a good reason to leave a review, and that is to get back at the
business who gave them a bad experience (and of course it will most
likely be a negative review). As you can see, this also falsely portrays the
real reputation of a business, with only the angry customers having the
motivation to leave a bad review. But what about all the happy
customers?

The problem is, the “What's in it for me?” factor comes into play, giving
satisfied customers no real reason or motivation to leave a review after
shopping or eating at a local restaurant. With Restaurant Pl. this is no
longer an issue.

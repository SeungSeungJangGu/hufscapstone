A call option contract gives the buyer (holder) the right to buy the underlying asset at a specified
price for a certain, fixed period. A put option contract gives the buyer (holder) the right to sell
the underlying asset at a specified price for a certain, fixed period. The trader who sells an option
contract (call or cut) to earn premium is a writer.

This paper describes the Hegic protocol and introduces the concept of a hedge contract: a system
of Ethereum contracts that accumulate and hold liquidity in a non-custodial way, write (sell) hedge
contracts to the holders, accumulate and distribute premiums between the liquidity providers
(writers) and conduct on-chain settlement of the contracts. In the traditional financial markets,
The Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) [2], the world's largest equity derivatives clearing
organization, plays an important role in the options markets. In Hegic protocol, there is no need for
a centralized clearing organization. Hedge contracts are created, maintained and settled
in a decentralized way. Exercising of hedge contracts is guaranteed by the liquidity allocated and
locked on them, timestamps and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that executes the code.

Holders can potentially benefit from using hedge contracts for protecting their assets’ value from
the downside during a certain period. A hedge contract is similar to insurance in a way that it
protects the owner from the potential price downside of an asset. There is no risk distribution in
the options trading on the traditional financial markets; this is why options sellers’ (writers’) losses
are theoretically unlimited [3]. Writers can potentially benefit from the fact that in hedge contracts
the risk is transferred from one particular person to the whole group of liquidity providers. Besides,
the returns on selling (writing) hedge contracts can potentially beat the on-chain lending returns
because the premiums paid by holders should be higher to cover the risk of losses for writers. Both
buyers (holders) and sellers (writers) of hedge contracts benefit from the transparency of contract
pricing and on-chain settlement. Therefore, hedge contracts on Hegic can be considered as
a non-custodial, trustless and censorship-resistant alternative to options contracts.

1. Introduction

Hegic is a protocol for trustless creating, maintaining and settling of hedge contracts.
Hedge contract is an options*-like on-chain contract that gives the holder (buyer) a right
to buy or to sell an asset at a certain price (strike) as well as imposes the obligation
on the writer (seller) to buy or to sell an asset during a certain period. It can be useful for the market
participants who want to protect their assets from the price downside and for the liquidity
providers who might find the returns on writing hedge contracts attractive enough to allocate some
of their capital on the liquidity pool contract. On the traditional (CBOE, CME, etc.) or crypto-assets
(Deribit, FTX, etc.) options exchanges holders and writers are individual agents (retail or
institutional). It means that while trading options, their capital is exposed to independent risks and
returns, and their trading results have nothing do to with the other market participants’ profits or
losses. On the sellers (writers) side, Hegic liquidity pool contracts accumulate liquidity from many
market participants simultaneously. This approach reduces the risks of losing capital (potential
downside) while providing liquidity providers with the returns.

Example: a writer sells an option contract and a hedge contract to compare the risks and returns
between these two instruments. They sell one put option contract on the options trading platform
and one put hedge contract on Hegic. The strike (execution) price is the same in both cases: $200. In
other words, the writer now has an obligation to buy an asset for $200 at any given moment until the
expiration date of an option contract and a hedge contract. At this stage, the goal is to compare the
downside of these two instruments, not the returns. That is why in this example the premium for
writing both an option contract and a hedge contract is zero.

After writing a put option contract and a put hedge contract, the price of a hypothetical asset
dropped from $200 to $150 before the expiration date. Because the writer has an obligation to buy
the asset for $200 and the current price is $150, they will suffer losses. However, in the case of
selling a hedge contract, the writer was one of the twenty independent liquidity providers and the
risks were distributed among all of them. The hypothetical results can now be compared:

Writing (Selling) a Put Option Contract vs. Writing (Selling) a Put Hedge Contract

Option Hedge Contract
Writer Individual Independent liquidity providers
Number of agents 1 20
Action Selling a put option contract Selling a put hedge contract
with a strike price: $200 with a strike price: $200
Current Price $150 $150
Losses -$50 -$2.5 per liquidity provider
Table 1: Comparison of writing a put option contract with writing a put hedge contract.

*Options are financial instruments that are derivatives based on the value of underlying securities such as
stocks. An options contract offers the buyer the opportunity to buy or sell—depending on the type of contract
they hold—the underlying asset. Unlike futures, the holder is not required to buy or sell the asset if they
choose not to. Source: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp

Three more parameters can be added to the example.

Expiration date: the day on which an option contract or a hedge contract becomes void. Hegic uses
timestamps for setting the period for a hedge contract.

Rate: predefined cost of opening a hedge contract that influences the premium (the price of a hedge
contract). More information on the pricing can be found in the Pricing Model section of this paper.

Premium: the price of an option contract, which the buyer of the option pays to the option writer
for the rights conveyed by the option contract. On Hegic, the function of the premium is the same:
a financial reward for the hedge contract writers (sellers) for taking the risks.

The hypothetical results of a situation in which the price of an asset goes in a direction that leads to
losses for the writer were compared above. Now the potential returns for an option writer and
a hedge contract writer with the new parameters included can be compared. The example below is
similar to the previous one: a writer sells both a put option contract and a put hedge contract
to compare the risks and returns. They sell one put option contract on the options trading platform
and one put hedge contract on Hegic. The strike price is the same in both cases: $200. However,
in this example, the price of an asset rises to $250. The writer will not suffer losses and will earn
the premium that was paid by the holder of an option contract and a hedge contract.

Option Hedge Contract
Writer Individual Independent liquidity providers
Number of agents 1 20
Action Selling a put option contract Selling a put hedge contract

Current Price $250 $250
Expiration Date 1 week 1 week
Rate 2% 2%
Premium $4 $4
Net Premium $4 $0.2 per liquidity provider
Table 2: Comparison of writing a put option contract with writing a put hedge contract.

In the case of Hegic, the premium is distributed between all the liquidity providers. This leads to
a situation in which their net premium is lower if to compare it to an individual option writer’s
premium. An important thing to mention is that in contrast to an individual options trader, liquidity
providers’ funds can be allocated on many hedge contracts simultaneously. It diversifies
the liquidity allocation and makes capital work in an efficient way. The assumption is that in
the long-run, liquidity providers’ returns could beat the returns of a solo options writer.

4. Opening (Buying) a Put Hedge Contract

In this section, a process of opening a hedge contract is described from a holder’s (buyer’s)
perspective. ETH used as an asset that the holder wishes to hold a hedge contract for. The holder
intends to protect their ETH from the price downside for the next two weeks. To have such
protection, they could buy a put hedge contract on Hegic. Buying a put hedge contract provides
a holder with a right to swap ETH to DAI [7] stablecoin at a certain price (strike) at any given
moment until the expiration. If the price of ETH falls, the holder will be able to swap ETH to DAI ata
strike price (higher) even though the market price of ETH can be lower.

Note that only a put hedge contract’s logic is described in this section. Initial implementations of
Hegic will allow the opening of put hedge contracts only. Call hedge contracts will be added as well.

To open a hedge contract the holder chooses the desired parameters. In this example, the amount
of ETH that they want to buy a hedge contract for is 1 ETH. The desired hedge period is 2 weeks.
The current market price of ETH is $200. Chainlink [6] oracles are used to track ETH/USD pair and
use it as a price feed data for evaluating the price of ETH in real-time. Note that this is the only part
of the Hegic system that uses oracles to work with the external price feeds. Maintenance and
execution of hedge contracts do not depend on the external price feeds. Such an approach is used for
guaranteeing the security of active hedge contracts and for preventing attacks and exploits
of oracles from price attacks. Thus, active hedge contracts are safe from the oracles’ manipulations.

For a hedge contract of 1 ETH with a period of 2 weeks, the holder chooses the $200 strike price
(an at-the-money hedge contract; the market price of ETH is $200). The price of such a hedge
contract is $10. $8 is a 4% rate of the 2-weeks ETH put hedge contract and $2 is a1% settlement fee
of the at-the-money put hedge contract. To activate it, the holder should pay $10 for the hedge
contract. The payment is considered as a processed, once miners confirm the transaction.

The holder sends the equivalent of $10 (the price of a hedge contract with the parameters chosen by
the holder) in ETH, as the possible payment method in the initial implementations of Hegic.

In the example, the holder chooses to pay $10 in ETH and sends 0.05 ETH to activate a hedge
contract. After the payment is received, the contract checks the amount. If the price was paid right
($10), the hedge contract will be activated. If the holder sent a lower amount (<$10),
the transaction will be rejected by the hedge contract and the amount will be returned to the
holder’s ETH-address. If the amount that was sent is more than it should be (>$10), then the hedge
contract will be activated and the odd money will be returned to the holder’s ETH-address.

During the hedge contract activation, an “end timestamp” will be created. In the example, the hedge
contract has a period of 2 weeks. It means that the “end timestamp” will be created for 2 weeks
after receiving the payment. Now the holder has a right to swap ETH to 200 DAI before the hedge
contract expiration. To do that they need to use the “release” function of the hedge contract: send
ETH to the hedge contract and automatically receive 200 DAI. It can be done at any given moment
during the hedge period. A hedge contract cannot be executed partly. To execute it the holder needs
to send 1 ETH and they will receive 200 DAI. Note that the ETH-address for executing a hedge
contract (swapping ETH to DAI) should be the same that was used for paying to activate it.
5. Writing (Selling) a Put Hedge Contract

In this section, a process of writing a hedge contract is described from a writer’s (seller’s)
perspective. Put hedge contracts writers (sellers) are liquidity providers who allocate DAI,
USDC [8], USDT [9] or other stablecoins on the liquidity pool contracts.

Liquidity pools on Hegic are non-custodial. No one has access to writers’ funds, but the holders for
whom they can be locked by the hedge contract for a certain period. The incentive for the writers to
provide liquidity is earning premiums that the holders (buyers) are paying to protect their crypto-
assets from the price downside. In the initial implementations of Hegic, the rate for holding a hedge
contract varies from 0.5% up to 2.0% per week. Theoretical yearly returns for hedge contracts
writers (sellers) are in between from +27% up to +108% APR on DAI, USDC or USDT. Rates depend
on the hedge contracts period and strike price that each holder chooses individually.

Example: after providing DAI stablecoins to the liquidity pool contract, the writer receives writeDAI
tokens (ERC20) that are automatically minted and give the writer a share in the liquidity pool
premiums that are distributed between all the liquidity providers. When the writer wishes
to receive their DAI back, they can send writeDAI tokens to the liquidity pool contract and use the
“purn” function. DAI will be automatically sent to the writer’s ETH-address.

The example from the previous section can be used to describe the hedge contract writing process.
For a put hedge contract of 1 ETH with a period of 2 weeks, the holder chooses the $200 strike price
(at-the-money; market price of ETH is $200). The price of such a put hedge contract is $10. In this
example, the holder chooses to pay $10 in ETH and sends 0.05 ETH to activate the hedge contract.
0.05 ETH (premium) will be automatically swapped to DAI stablecoin using the Uniswap [10]
decentralized exchange. The returns for writers are denominated in DAI. The premium in DAI will be
added to the liquidity pool after the successful swap. Liquidity providers receive the premium in
advance so that they can withdraw it at any given moment. They should not wait for a hedge
contract to expire to be able to withdraw the premium in DAI. After the premium is received, the
liquidity in DAI will be locked for a period of a hedge contract that the holder has paid for. Some
portion of the liquidity should always be unlocked to let the liquidity providers claim their DAI that
they have provided to the liquidity pool before. Initial implementations of Hegic will allow 80%
of the total amount of DAI in the pool to be locked in active hedge contracts. The other 20% are
always unlocked and can be used by those who would like to withdraw the liquidity from the pool.

If the amount of unlocked DAI in the liquidity pool is not enough for the writer to swap their
writeDAI to DAI, they will have to wait for the active hedge contracts’ expiration. If the writer
wishes to withdraw the liquidity from the pool, but the amount of unlocked DAI is not enough, they
send a request to swap their writeDAI to DAI as soon as the liquidity will be unlocked. Their
requests are aggregated in queues. Premiums in DAI will be distributed between the liquidity
providers in the proportions of DAI that they have allocated in the liquidity pool.

If four independent liquidity providers have provided 200000 DAI to the pool:

Provider 1: 100000 DAI; Provider 2: 50000 DAI; Provider 3: 25000 DAI; Provider 4: 25000 DAI; then
all the premiums will be distributed in such a way: Provider 1: 50%; Provider 2: 25%; Provider 3:
12.5%; Provider 4: 12.5%. The same distribution will be for the losses that may occur
if the hedge contracts holders swap their ETH to DAI after the price drop. ETH that the holders send
to the liquidity pool while executing a hedge contract will be automatically swapped to DAI using the
Uniswap decentralized exchange. The potential losses for writers are also denominated in DAI.

6. The Pricing Model for Put Hedge Contracts

In this section, the pricing model for put hedge contracts on Hegic will be described. The holder
can choose a hedge contract with one of the strike prices that are predefined on Hegic. The strike is
the exercise price of a hedge contract. If the holder (buyer) chooses a hedge contract with a $200
strike price, then during the hedge period they will be able to sell the asset for that price, no matter
what is the market price of an asset. The strike prices on Hegic are always differing in a range
of 5% (multiplier) from the current (market) price of an asset:

Put Hedge Contract Strike Price
Out-of-the-money Market Price * Multiplier 0.9 $180
Out-of-the-money Market Price * Multiplier 0.95 $190
At-the-money Market Price $200
In-the-money Market Price * Multiplier 1.05 $210
In-the-money Market Price * Multiplier 1.1 $220
Table 3: Strike prices and multipliers of put hedge contracts on Hegic.

Similar to a put option contract logic, a put hedge contract is at-the-money if the strike price of the
contract is equal to the market price of the underlying asset; in-the-money if the asset’s value is
above the strike price; and out-of-the-money if the strike price is less than the market price of the
underlying asset. Each put hedge contract has a rate that depends on the strike and period:

Put Hedge Contract Hedge Contract Periods and Rates
Strike Price 1 week 2 weeks 3 weeks 1 month 2 months
Out-of-the-money $180 0.5% 1% 1.5% 2% 4%
Out-of-the-money $190 1% 2% 3% 4% 8%
At-the-money $200 2% 4% 6% 8% 16%
In-the-money $210 1% 2% 3% 4% 8%
In-the-money $220 0.5% 1% 1.5% 2% 4%

Table 4: Rates of put hedge contracts with different strike prices and periods on Hegic.

For the sake of simplicity, the pricing model for hedge contracts differs from the traditional
financial markets options pricing models such as a Black-Sholes mathematical model [4] for the
dynamics of a financial market containing derivative investment instruments. The rate on Hegic is
a predefined percent of the asset’s value that depends on the period of a hedge contract. The cost of
holding a put hedge contract for a certain period is called the premium.

Put Hedge Contract Hedge Contract Periods and Premiums
Strike Price 1 week 2 weeks 3 weeks 4 weeks 8 weeks

Out-of-the-money $180 $0.9 $1.8 $2.7 $3.6 $7.2
Out-of-the-money $190 $1.9 $3.8 $5.7 $7.6 $15.2
At-the-money $200 $4 $8 $12 $16 $32
In-the-money $210 $12.1 $14.2 $16.3 $18.4 $26.8
In-the-money $220 $21.1 $22.2 $23.3 $24.4 $28.8

Table 5: Calculated premiums for hedge contracts with different strike prices and periods on Hegic.

The formula for calculating the rate of an at-the-money (ATM) put hedge contract is:
S*R=ATMR,

where S - Strike Price; R - Predefined Rate (%); ATMR - ATM Rate (put contract).

For example, the rate for holding a put hedge contract with a strike price of $200 and a period of
2 weeks is 4%. Using the formula above, we can calculate the rate:

$200 * 4% = $8

The formula for calculating the rate of an in-the-money (ITM) put hedge contract is:
S*R+(S—M) =ITMR,

where S - Strike Price; R - Predefined Rate (%); M - Market Price; ITMR - ITM Rate (put contract).

For example, the rate for holding a put hedge contract with a strike price of $220 (in-the-money)
and a period of 1 month is 2%. It is lower than in the previous case. However, the rate of an in-the-
money hedge contract includes the difference between the strike and market prices. Using the
formula above, we can calculate the value of the premium for an ITM hedge contract:

$220 * 2% + ($220 - $200) = $24.4

The formula for calculating the rate of an out-of-the-money (OTM) put hedge contract is:
S*R = OTMR,

where S - Strike Price; R - Predefined Rate (%); OTMR - OTM Rate (put contract).

The value of a put hedge contract consists of both intrinsic value and time value. The greater the
amount of time until a put hedge contract expires, the more time value it has. As you have might
notice, out-of-the-money and at-the-money rates formulas are the same. However, the in-the-
money rate is calculated differently, because OTM and ATM hedge contracts have only a time-value,
but ITM hedge contracts also have an intrinsic value. The holder could exercise its right under
the put hedge contract and sell the underlying asset for more than its current value. It means the
ITM put hedge contract has intrinsic value. There is also a settlement fee that is should be paid by
the holders to activate a hedge contract. The settlement fee can be calculated using these formulas:

Ax* P «0.5% = OTMSF,
where A - Amount; P - Price; Predefined Rate (0.5%); OTMSF - OTM Settlement Fee (put contract).
A*P*1%= ATMSF,
where A - Amount; P - Price; Predefined Rate (1%); ATMSF - ATM Settlement Fee (put contract).
A*P*0.5% = ITMSF,

where A - Amount; P - Price; Predefined Rate (0.5%); ITMSF - ITM Settlement Fee (put contract).

10
For example, if the amount of an asset that the holder wishes to buy an ATM hedge contract for is 1
and the market price is $200, then the settlement fee will be $2 (1 * $200 * 1% = $2). For opening
a hedge contract, the holder should pay the premium (rate plus fee) forward. The formulas are:

OTMR + OTMSF = OTMP,
where OTMR - OTM Rate; OTMSF — OTM Settlement Fee; OTMP - OTM Premium.
ATMR + ATMSF = ATMP,
where ATMR - ATM Rate; ATMSF — ATM Settlement Fee; ATMP - ATM Premium.
ITMR + ITMSF = ITMP,

where ITMR - ITM Rate; ITMSF — ITM Settlement Fee; ITMP - ITM Premium.

7. Price Comparison: Hedge Contracts on Hegic vs. Options on Deribit

In this section, the prices of ETH put options contracts that are traded on the crypto exchange
Deribit [5] will be compared with the prices of ETH put hedge contracts on Hegic. This analysis
makes sense because the functionality of these two instruments is relatively similar, as well as the
value for the holders (buyers) from using them. Hedge contracts on Hegic can be considered as
a non-custodial, trustless and censorship-resistant alternative to options contracts.

Options contract prices are volatile. To make this comparison as representative as possible, four
different contracts with periods (expirations) of one, two, four and eight weeks will be compared.
The strike prices of the two compared contracts (a put option contract and a put hedge contract)
should the same, or at least as close as possible. Reference options contracts used for the price
comparison are ETH options contracts on Deribit options exchange.

The first of them is a put option contract on ETH with an expiration date of February 7, 2020. This
price analysis was conducted on January 31, 2020, with the expiration of the contract at the time
of comparison: 6 days 20 hours 52 minutes. At the snapshot minute of all the reference contract
prices, the market price of ETH was $180 ($180.05 - $180.30).

It is now possible to compare the option contract prices on Deribit with the put hedge contracts
prices on Hegic. In this example, the market price of ETH is $180. Note that the strikes on Hegic can
differ (be higher or lower) from the strikes on Deribit because on Hegic they differ in a range of 5%
(multiplier) from the current (market) price of an asset. The strike prices difference on Deribit
for ETH-7FEB20 contract is fixed: $10.

At-the-money (ATM) is a put option contract or a put hedge contract with a strike price of $180
(equal to the market price).

Put option contract’s (ETH7FEB-2020) strike price is $180 (at-the-money).
The ATM option contract for 1 ETH with 1-week expiration has a price of $5.96 on Deribit
ETH put hedge contract’s strike price is $180 (at-the-money).

The ATM hedge contract for 1 ETH with 1-week expiration has a price of $3.60 on Hegic.

In-the-money is a put option contract or a put hedge contract with a strike price greater than $180
(the asset’s value is above the strike price).

Put option contract’s (ETH7FEB-2020) strike price is $190 (in-the-money).

The ITM option contract for 1 ETH with 1-week expiration has a price of $12.20 on Deribit.
ETH put hedge contract’s strike price is $189 (in-the-money).

The ITM hedge contract for 1 ETH with 1-week expiration has a price of $10.89 on Hegic.
Put option contract’s (ETH7FEB-2020) strike price is $200 (in-the-money).

The ITM option contract for 1 ETH with 1-week expiration has a price of $20.52 on Deribit.
ETH put hedge contract’s strike price is $198 (in-the-money).

The ITM hedge contract for 1 ETH with 1-week expiration has a price of $18.99 on Hegic.

Out-of-the-money is a put option contract or a put hedge contract with a strike price lower than
$180 (the asset’s value is below the strike price).

Put options contract’s (ETH7FEB-2020) strike price is $170 (out-of-the-money).

The OTM option contract for 1 ETH with 1-week expiration has a price of $2.26 on Deribit

In most cases put hedge contracts prices on Hegic are lower than put options contracts prices
on Deribit. However, the goal of Hegic is not to offer the cheapest options-like instrument, but to
introduce a new kind of a non-custodial, trustless and censorship-resistant contract with on-chain
settlement. Hegic uses a dynamic strike price determination approach, which influences the rate
and the premium of hedge contracts. Because of that, market participants might find and use
arbitrage opportunities between hedge contracts on Hegic and options contracts on the options
exchanges (e.g. Deribit).

Note that only the premiums were compared in this section. Options fees and delivery (settlement
at expiration) on Deribit, as well as the settlement fee on Hegic, were excluded from the final price
comparison. Holders should be aware that a put hedge contract or a put option contract both have
a break-even price. It can be calculated in such a way:

S—P-—F=BE,

where S - Strike Price; P - Premium Paid; F - Fees Paid; BE - Break-even Price.

For example, if the holder bought a put hedge contract with a $200 strike that they have paid $8
in premium and $2 in settlement fee for, then the break-even price for such a hedge contract is:

$200 - $8 - $2 = $190

Break-even price is a level at which the holder can execute the hedge contract and earn profits that
cover the premium and settlement fee that have been paid for activating the hedge contract. In the
example above, if the strike price of a put hedge contract is $200 and the market price of an asset is
$190, then executing the hedge contract (selling an asset for $200 when its market price is $190)
will create $10 in profits that cover $8 premium and $2 settlement fee.

On Hegic, the holder has a right to execute a hedge contract at any time, even if it has not reached the
break-even price. However, it is important to understand the basic principles behind put options
contracts and put hedge contracts to use these instruments properly.

Initial implementations of Hegic will enable holders to buy hedge contracts without an ability to
resell it to other holders before the expiration. Community members and developers can create
secondary markets and decentralized exchanges for hedge contracts. It is planned to add
a decentralized exchange functionality and markets for trading hedge contracts on Hegic.

Early versions of hedge contracts and their pricing model consider the probability that the holders
will start using them as insurance from the assets’ price downside. With the time and additional
functionality, speculating on hedge contracts prices will become possible. Future versions of Hegic
will be close to the current implementations of cryptocurrency options exchanges such as Deribit,
FTX and others in terms of functionality. However, the development efforts will preserve the goal of
creating a trustless, decentralized and non-custodial system of hedge contracts.

To make the price comparison as representative as possible, the prices of two more put options
contracts with other expiration dates will be compared with the prices of put hedge contracts.

The first of them is an option contract on ETH with an expiration date of February 14, 2020. This
price analysis was conducted on February 7, 2020, with the expiration of the contract at the time of
comparison: 6 days 23 hours 54 minutes. At the snapshot minute of all the reference contract prices,
the market price of ETH was $219 ($218.78 - $219.05).

8. Liquidity Pools

After providing DAI, USDC, USDT or other stablecoins to the liquidity pool, writeASSET tokens
will be minted and sent to the provider’s ETH-address. The formula for minting writeDAI tokens is:

W * AP
AW = ,
P

where AW - the amount of writeDAI tokens that a liquidity provider will receive;
AP - the amount of DAI tokens that a liquidity provider provides to the pool;

W - the total amount of writeDAI tokens that were already distributed;

P - the total amount of DAI tokens that were provided to the pool.

After providing liquidity, the writers will start to receive premiums. After joining the pool, they will
start earning the writing returns starting from the next holder who will pay for activating
a hedge contract. The premiums or losses from writing hedge contracts that were activated before
a new liquidity provider joined a pool will not be distributed to this new liquidity provider. The
liquidity that is allocated on the pool contract is automatically converted into CHAI [11]. CHAI is
ERC20 token that earns interest on DAI without requiring it to be locked in the contract.

While allocating DAI token in the pool on Hegic, liquidity providers will be simultaneously earning
DSR (DAI Savings Rate) [12]. Allocating DAI in the liquidity pool provides writers with the returns on
DAI paid by MakerDAO’s DSR plus the premiums that are paid by hedge contracts holders.

On-chain lending protocols provide users with the returns that are paid in real-time. Hedge
contracts writing returns that liquidity providers are earning on Hegic cannot guarantee the same
stability and predictability, because they depend on the market volatility of the assets that the
hedge contracts are held for. However, the theoretical returns on writing hedge contracts can be
higher than the yields paid by on-chain lending protocols. Writing hedge contracts, as
an instrument, has different risk and return profile and cannot be compared with on-chain lending.
The differences between these two instruments in terms of expected returns can be plotted. One
should remember that it is not a comparison of two competitive instruments, because, as it was
described in this section, hedge contracts writers are also earning DSR and these on-chain lending
returns should be added to the expected returns of writing hedge contracts.

9. HEGIC Token [the first liquidity offering is planned for 05/05/2020]

HEGIC is an ERC20 token that is used for distribution of the settlement fees between the token
holders as well as in the protocol on-chain governance. Settlement fees that accrue on Hegic are
distributed between all the HEGIC token holders every quarter. Therefore, HEGIC token combines
the collective fractional ownership, utility and governance functions.

HEGIC token’s value proposition for holders is better rates for holding hedge contracts. To use the
discount, holders have to hold HEGIC tokens on their ETH-address that they use to activate hedge
contracts. The market value of HEGIC tokens on the holder’s ETH-address should be the same or
higher than the strike price of the hedge contract to have a lower rate. Initial implementations of
Hegic will give the HEGIC token holders a 30% discount for the rates (excluding a settlement fee).

Example: for a hedge contract of 1 ETH with a period of 2 weeks the holder chooses the $200 strike
price (at-the-money; market price of ETH is $200). The price of such a hedge contract is $10. $8 is
a 4% rate of the 2-weeks ETH hedge contract and $2 is a 1% settlement fee of the at-the-money
hedge contract. The holder also holds $250 in HEGIC tokens on their ETH-address. The value of
HEGIC tokens is higher than the strike price of a hedge contract. That gives the holder a right to use
a 30% discount on the rate. Instead of $8, the holder should only pay $5.6 as a rate for holding
a 2-weeks hedge contract plus a $2 settlement fee. To activate it, the holder should pay $7.6 in total
for holding the hedge contract instead of $10.

HEGIC token’s value proposition for writers is no delay, priority unlocks of their liquidity. To have
a priority for liquidity unlock, the writers have to hold HEGIC tokens on their ETH-address that they
use to provide the liquidity to the pool. The market value of HEGIC tokens on the writer’s ETH-
address should be the same or higher than the liquidity provided to the pool to have a no delay,
priority unlock.

Example: if the amount of unlocked DAI in the liquidity pool is not enough for the writer to swap
their writeDAI to DAI, they will have to wait for the active hedge contract’s expiration. If the writer
wishes to withdraw the liquidity from the pool, but the amount of unlocked DAI is not enough, they
send a request to swap their writeDAI to DAI as soon as the liquidity will be unlocked. Their
requests are aggregated in queues. However, if the writer holds HEGIC tokens and their market
value is the same or higher than the liquidity that they have provided to the pool, they can send
their writeDAI and instantly receive the amount of DAI. Liquidity from the Hegic Development Fund
(HDF) will be used to swap the writer’s writeDAI to DAI immediately.

HEGIC token is used in HIPs (Hegic Improvement Proposal) for governance purposes. HEGIC token
holders can vote for changing hedge contracts rates, settlement fee size, strike price multipliers,
assets supported by hedge contracts and more. The governance mechanism will be implemented as
soon as the Hegic protocol will have the traction and at least 100 monthly active holders and
writers. HEGIC has a fixed supply of 3012009 HEGIC tokens. Tokens will be unlocked with the time
after the particular goals are reached by the Hegic protocol.

In the First Epoch, 10% of the HEGIC total supply will be unlocked and offered on one of the
decentralized exchanges with the purpose of the first liquidity offering of HEGIC tokens. 301200,90
HEGIC tokens will be offered at a fixed price of $0.332. All the funds from the first liquidity offering
will be allocated in the Hegic Development Fund (HDF). The funds will be proceeded for conducting
the security audits of the Hegic contracts and for continuing the development of the protocol.

22
The transition to a new epoch will only be activated, if the market capitalization of HEGIC reaches
a new milestone. These milestones require a ten-time growth level of the market capitalization.
When a new milestone is reached, 15% of the total supply will be offered a fixed price as new
liquidity at on one of the decentralized exchanges. The funds attracted during the liquidity offerings
will be distributed between all the HEGIC token holders (90% - 95%) and the Hegic Development
Fund (HDF) (5% - 10%).

activated if the market capitalization of Hegic reaches $100B. 94% of the funds received from the
liquidity offering (~$15B) will be distributed between all the HEGIC token holders (only those who
held HEGIC tokens before the Sixth Epoch snapshot) and 6% of the funds received will be allocated
in the Hegic Development Fund.

In the Seventh Epoch, 100% of the unlocked HEGIC tokens (451801,35 HEGIC, 15% of total supply)
will be offered at a fixed price of $332000.00 / HEGIC. The transition to the Seventh Epoch will only
be activated if the market capitalization of Hegic reaches $1T. 95% of the funds received from the
liquidity offering (~$150B) will be distributed between all the HEGIC token holders (only those
who held HEGIC tokens before the Seventh Epoch snapshot) and 5% of the funds received will be
allocated in the Hegic Development Fund.

For a transition to a new epoch to be activated, the first requirement is that the historical trading
volume of HEGIC token on decentralized exchanges should not be less than 10% of the new
capitalization level that has been reached (to eliminate the HEGIC token price manipulations to
unlock new tokens). The second requirement is that the total amount of historical turnover of active
hedge contracts should not be less than 10% of the new capitalization level (to align the demand for
hedge contracts and the adoption pace of the protocol with future liquidity offerings).

Capitalization Required Volume Required Turnover

First Epoch $1M - -

Second Epoch $10M $1M+ $1M+

Third Epoch $100M $10M+ $10M+
Fourth Epoch $1B $100M+ $100M+
Fifth Epoch $10B $1B+ $1B+

Sixth Epoch $100B $10B+ $10B+
Seventh Epoch $1T $100B+ $100B+

10. Conclusion

In this paper, the Hegic protocol and the concept of a hedge contract were described. Hedge
contract is an options-like on-chain contract that gives the holder (buyer) a right to buy or to sell
an asset at a certain price (strike) as well as imposes the obligation on the writer (seller) to buy or
to sell an asset during a certain period. Hedge contracts can be considered as a non-custodial,
trustless and censorship-resistant alternative to options contracts. On Hegic, liquidity providers’
(writers’) funds can be distributed between many hedge contracts simultaneously. It diversifies
the liquidity allocation and makes capital work in an efficient way. The assumption is that in the
long-run, liquidity providers’ returns could beat the returns of a solo options writer.

The initial implementations of Hegic will enable holders to buy put hedge contracts that will give
them a right to swap ETH to DAI stablecoin at a certain price (strike) at any given moment until the
expiration. Hegic uses a dynamic strike price determination approach, which influences the rate
and the premium of hedge contracts. Maintenance and execution of hedge contracts do not depend
on the external price feeds.

Liquidity pools are non-custodial. In the initial implementations of Hegic, the rate for holding
a hedge contract varies from 0.5% up to 2.0% per week. Theoretical yearly returns for hedge
contracts writers (sellers) are in between from +27% up to +108% APR on DAI, USDC or USDT.
While allocating DAI token in the pool on Hegic, liquidity providers will be simultaneously earning
DSR (DAI Savings Rate). Allocating DAI in the liquidity pool provides writers with the returns
on DAI paid by MakerDAO’s DSR plus the premiums that are paid by hedge contracts holders.

HEGIC an ERC20 token that is used for distribution of 100% of the settlement fees between all the
token holders and in the protocol on-chain governance purposes. HEGIC token combines
the collective fractional ownership, utility and governance functions. HEGIC has a fixed supply of
3012009 HEGIC tokens, which will be unlocked with the time after the particular goals are reached
by the Hegic protocol.

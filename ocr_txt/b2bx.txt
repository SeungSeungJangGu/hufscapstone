Briefly about the project

B2BX is an aggregator of cryptocurrency liquidity for margin and exchange trading
and distribution of liquidity to brokerage companies. We plan to make the first
official B2B cryptocurrency exchange-aggregator or marketplace, in which we will
connect at least 5% of the market of Forex/DMA and stock brokers, and give them
the opportunity to provide their clients with the trading in cryptocurrencies.

While current decisions in the market are focused on retail, B2BX will focus
exclusively on institutional clients: crypto-exchange, Forex and DMA brokers,
cryptocurrency brokers and exchangers, hedge funds and other professional
market participants.

During we have connected 30 new customers. The launch of the aggregator of
crypto-liquidity gave us 12 clients in 2 months (July-August of 2017).

. Demand for trading in cryptocurrencies among traders forms the
demand for providing this service among brokers. With the further development of
the infrastructure for aggregation and distribution of cryptoliquity, we will be able
to connect:

— 200+ clients on MetaTrader (MT4/MT5) and other trading platforms. There
are 4000+ Forex brokers working on MT4/MTS5 platforms all over the world — more
than 50% of the Forex market.

(after integration with other major trading platforms, ECN-platforms and

aggregators, like Integral and PrimeXM) — 500+ customers.

— 700+ customers (5% of the brokerage services market).

Cryptocurrency market

Seven years ago, cryptocurrencies seemed like a kind of entertainment for geeks:
bitcoins were used for buying pizza, and in the world there was nothing more
reliable than the dollar. However, everything has changed quickly — the bitcoin
rate has grown by 405% in less than half a year, and new players join the market
every day: crypto-exchanges, brokers, individuals.

The Blockchain is an ideal solution for micropayments, banking transactions,
currency purchases and other services where there are risks of possible fraud or
data security. For several years, Blockchain has gone from a novelty in the
technological world to an instrument that is used by large banks, corporations and
states.

The market of cryptocurrency is growing, and people want to operate them as a
full-fledged tool — for example, to come to the bank and buy bitcoins. Now there is
no possibility for this action, because there is no regulation of this market. The last
six months, all states and corporations are talking about bitcoin but during this
time the regulatory base did not have time to form: the States did not manage to
adapt and prepare new laws.

To date, the capitalization of the cryptocurrency market according to
data is 143 billion dollars (an increase of 2 times in six months).

The current crypto-exchanges simultaneously perform the functions of the
exchange, broker and exchanger.

The table shows that the largest stock exchanges do not fall under the regulation.

And those that are regulated by the laws of Japan offer few pairs for trade. This

opens a new, yet free niche, which we propose to take on brokerage companies.

Now there are more than 8,000 Forex brokers in the world, of which more than

4,000 are using MT4/MTS5 terminals. To understand the scale of the Forex retail

market, it's enough to look at the volume of the largest brokers: it makes from $15

billion a day.

If we talk about the brokerage services market in general, now there are more than

12,000 brokerage companies in the industry. The absolute majority of these

brokerages are online brokers, which provides trading on all available instruments

from one account: currencies, stocks, futures, CFD contracts, goods. Now, contracts

for cryptocurrency will be added to this list. This market is much larger and wider

than the crypto-exchange market.

Exchanges with their services and limits on deposit and withdrawal do not satisfy

all demands for cryptocurrencies, which considerably exceeds the offer. We will

give an opportunity to all brokers in the world to provide their clients with trade in

cryptocurrencies and we will connect to our aggregator at least 5% of this market —

this will become a revolution in the crypto industry.

Cryptocurrency market

Problems of cryptocurrency market

There is no market regulation. Banks and licensed brokers cannot fully
1. | operate with the cryptocurrency, until it is legalized. There is no clear
regulatory framework, and therefore large financial institutions do not allow
private traders and investors to work through the usual mechanisms of the broker:
it is not possible to legitimately deposit and withdraw money. This situation is
almost everywhere. Of course, there are unregulated exchanges that are not
protected by law but this holds back many traders and investors.

Exchanges in strict jurisdictions often work without receiving fiat money —
exclusively in cryptocurrencies. There are exchanges, for example, Bitstamp
(Luxembourg), which work officially, but this is an exception. The main problem is
the lack of regulation in the world of crypto-exchanges and exchangers.

Solution. We will do exchange trade with physical delivery on the basis of
the Japanese company with a license JFSA, margin — on the basis of
CySec, ASIC, FCA. The number of our licenses will depend on the success
of the crowdfunding campaign.

a) In case of marginal trading with or without leverage, the cryptoactive
will change its estimated value depending on the current price, but will
always be nominated in the deposit currency, which depends on the
country, model and regulatory framework of the broker. For example, DMA
brokers allow to open accounts in the world's major currencies: §, €, ¥, ¥, X,
and other currencies, depending on the location of the broker.

In margin trading, the broker's client buys/sells the contract for the asset
price, and the balance changes in nominated currency. We assume that
brokers will begin to nominate balances of accounts in popular
cryptocurrencies soon: BTC and ETH, if their regulators allow them to do
so. Then the need for crypto-exchanges will decrease: customers will be
able to deposit funds in any customary way and directly in traders room
(the personal area on the website) to change the fiat money for
cryptocurrency. Traders can open a trading account nominated in BTC,

and buy/sell the crypto assets that the broker offers.

If the broker accepts deposit in the cryptocurrency or fiat money and
nominate trading account in cryptocurrency, then the trader who needs to
buy ETH for speculation does not need to actually exchange one asset for
another — it is enough to buy a contract for difference and, upon closing
this order, the balance will immediately be reflected in the cryptocurrency
in which account is nominated (example.e. BTC).

Cryptocurrency market

Problems of cryptocurrency market

Actually, traders and investors who make money on speculation do not
need an actual exchange and the number of such traders on the market is
much more than those who need real cryptoactivity.

Those traders need a reliable counterparty to fulfill its own obligations
when the price of the asset bought by them grows. And if the broker is
regulated, allows to get money in the usual way and provides leverage, it is
much easier and more reliable for the client to open a trading account
with such broker and start working with a cryptocurrency.

E.g. You have $10,000 in your account. Leverage 1:3. The price for 1 BTC =
$4,000. With the leverage of 1:3, you can buy 1 BTC not for $4,000, but for
$1,333. Those with the marginal trading of $10,000 can buy about 7.5 BTC.

This triples the profit with less investment for every point of growth in the
value of BTC. For this you will pay the broker SWAP or the percentage for
using the loan funds on your leverage. The leverage is optional, you cannot
take it.

b) Physical delivery exchange. We will do on the basis of a Japanese
company with a license JFSA, which allows you to exchange fiat for
cryptocurrency (so far only at BTC and ETH and back). The physical
delivery exchange will be available to customers who have passed strict
KYC (know your client) and met the AML standards. Any institutional
client will be able to open an account in B2BX and, on his own behalf,
exchange fiat for crypto and vice versa, performing orders of traders. For
example, hedge funds, investment funds and other participants will be
able to buy BTC and ETH and withdraw them to their verified BTC and ETH
addresses.

We will keep tracking all jurisdictions, and as other regulators will allow
other cryptocurrencies, they will be added to the range of available
products.

c) Exchange of the cryptocurrency for another cryptocurrency will be
available to institutional clients under the jurisdiction of Singapore.

For convenient on-boarding of the client, we plan to provide all types of
crypto-liquidity (marginal, fiat-crypto and crypto-crypto) under one company,
when the regulatory framework of the relevant jurisdiction will allow this.

Cryptocurrency market

Problems of cryptocurrency market

2..| Lack of liquidity. Liquidity is the permanent volume for the purchase or sale

of an asset at any time.

Time and technical resources are required to solve this problem. The
broker has to collect liquidity from many crypto-exchanges and other
counterparty. For each of them, contract and a deposit are required — this
is inconvenient and requires constant monitoring and monetary costs. All
major transactions have to be made at the OTC market (over-the-counter
buy and sell market) at negotiated prices.

Solution. Integration of B2BX with the largest trading platforms and
aggregators of liquidity and the consolidation of brokers, stock exchanges
and financial institutions on one place will provide a depth of the market
for cryptocurrencies.

E.g. If you want to buy bitcoins for $15 million (this is the usual amount for
an institutional client), you cannot do it through crypto-exchanges. Many
of them do not accept fiat money, and those that accept will not be able to
take $15 million at a go, as their bank will melt the payment and will
require justifying documents about the purpose of payment and the origin
of the funds.

All such transactions are now being made on the OTC market. These are
contractual transactions directly or through intermediaries.

If you want to buy BTC for $15 million, then most likely the crypto-broker
will not be able to hedge this position in the foreign market or another
counterparty.

However, by connecting to the B2BX aggregator, the broker will be able to
get enough volume and hedge an unlimited amount due to the fact that in
the aggregator the liquidity will come from top crypto-exchanges.
Moreover, an increase in the number of institutional clients will create

liquidity within the aggregator.

How it works. For example, 50 large brokers are connected to the
aggregator and aggregator itself is connected to 10 crypto-exchanges.
Several brokers in the moment buy BTC in the volume of 30 million
dollars. At this point in the aggregator comes the overall bid for the sale of
BTC from other brokers for the same price of $20 million.

Cryptocurrency market

Problems of cryptocurrency market

20 million to buy matches with 20 million for sale, and 10 million goes to
crypto-exchanges at Top of the Book prices and will be executed on those
exchanges where there is an affordable volume at the best prices.

The example is greatly simplified to explain in plain words the simplest
scenario of the aggregator operation. In practice, much depends on the
settings, filters, number of clients, counterparties, etc.

Integration with crypto-exchanges and other
counterparties entails technical difficulties, because each broker
or exchange has its own systems and API. Many of them have a WebSocket API
and REST API, while some have their own protocols.

Often, crypto-exchanges develop trading platforms by themselves. The industry is
new, and vendors of trading platforms and software/service providers do not have
time to adapt the current one or develop a new software, applicable to the
crypto-industry. As a result, there is a whole "alphabet" of trading platforms,
order-books and matching-systems. Many of them do not meet the standards and
norms: they do not withstand the load and do not pass security audits.

If we compare infrastructure of crypto-exchanges with the infrastructure of
brokerage companies, we can see a significant difference: first are inferior in
safety, reliability, convenience, quality of business processes of companies
themselves and trading processes through terminals provided by vendors of
trading platforms (MetaQuotes, ProTrader, DevExperts, SpotWare, etc.).

Of course, there are examples of quality execution. We assume that such
crypto-exchanges can continue to grow. The rest either stagnate, or switch to more
advanced software, similar to Forex/DMA and the stock market, where a dozen
vendors hold 80% of the market.

Brokerage companies need software that allows them to connect to different
providers, aggregate them and convert them into a single international

standardized protocol format — FIX API.

FIX API (Financial Information Exchange) — protocol of information
exchange, a universal standard of communication adopted by many
banks, prime brokers and hedge funds. In our case, it is the way of
communication between the broker and the liquidity providers.

Cryptocurrency market

Problems of cryptocurrency market

Solution. B2BX aggregates and converts protocols from different
exchanges and providers and gives them to the broker through a single
protocol of the FIX API standard.

We took SoftFX aggregator as a basic solution, it is already integrated with
the 5 largest crypto-exchanges and has the FIX API protocol for further
distribution of liquidity to other systems and aggregators.

The solution is already working: 5 crypto-exchanges and 12 professional
market participants have already connected to B2BX.

OUR PLAN

1. We will develop connectors, bridges and gateways to the B2BX
aggregator, which will allow 50% of all trading platforms to be connected,
and any engineer will be able to develop own connector to the B2BX FIX
API.

2. We will connect B2BX to aggregators and ECN-platforms on the
FOREX/DMA market, which do not yet provide their clients (brokers,
banks, funds) with access to the pool of crypto-liquidity. We are already
working on integration with Integral, PrimeXM and oneZero, the largest
aggregators of the industry with the developed infrastructure of

customers and liquidity providers.

3. We will distribute liquidity to brokers for their further distribution to
retail customers. We will continue to create native integration with all the
significant vendors of trading platforms that serve not less than a few
percent of the market.

A. | Long compliance process. Demand for cryptocurrency is much bigger than
supply: at all crypto-exchanges and other counterparties that provide
cryptocurrency trading, there is a lot of retail customers. If we talk about the top 10
crypto-exchanges, then because of the lack of clear rules, they are experiencing
regulatory difficulties in dealing with banks and regulators. Therefore, the process
of passing the verification of new users is very hard. To open accounts for 3-5
exchanges, institutional clients need to spend a few months on each exchange,
because compliance will be very long.

Solution. With us, a broker or any financial institution signs one contract
and receives a single marginal account and 3 types of liquidity:
Forex/Spot, DMA Stock market and crypto-liquidity.

Aggregator B2BX

B2BX will provide brokers and all institutional clients with cryptocurrency liquidi-
ty, provide a depth of the market for cryptocurrencies and unite brokers on one
marketplace.

Current status. The product is ready and it is in the first working version. This
means that basic functionality is done, there are connectors to 5 crypto-exchanges
and we already have 12 institutional clients for this product. You can request a
demo by sending us an email: sales@b2broker.net.

Plan. We plan to develop an aggregator in the marketplace for institutional clients,
where only accredited participants can work. Brokers, banks, funds — all partici-
pants will be controlled by the exchange and financial regulators. The Exchange
will provide a rating of brokers and will act as a guarantor of reliability for custom-
ers who will choose as a broker member of B2BX.

To develop infrastructure, connect all the aggregators of the industry, expand the
team of developers and technical support department, and obtain licenses which
allow working in this market legally require funds.

Aggregator B2BX

B2BX mechanism of work

B2BX aggregator will work in three directions:

1. | Physical delivery exchange. Trade will be carried out on the basis of the
company with the Japanese license JFSA. April 1, 2017 the law was passed
and now Japanese companies working with cryptocurrencies can use Bitcoin and
Ethereum for mutual settlements with each other. The activity of companies
working with cryptocurrencies is regulated by strict requirements:

+ Licenses are required to conduct operations with cryptocurrencies;

+ The company must have reserve funds (at least $100,000), regularly report
to financial regulators and undergo an external audit in the tax service;

+ The company must have an office/representation and two directors in
Japan.

Marginal trading. Right now, we are using a company with a Vanuatu

license (VFSC) for the aggregation and distribution of liquidity. To connect
in our aggregator large financial institutions in different jurisdictions, we plan to
obtain the following licenses: CySEC (Cyprus), FCA (UK) and ASIC (Australia).

Marginal cryptocurrency liquidity will be distributed through brokers with a
license. We explain more about what this means below.

Now the marginal liquidity is allowed — brokers have the permission of the main
regulators and they offer retail clients to trade with a cryptocurrency with a
leverage: trading in CFD contracts for cryptocurrency without a real exchange of
the asset. A CFD contract is a derivative that a broker quotes by itself or broadcasts
from a liquidity provider.

This means that if your account is nominated in §, € or P, then when buying bitcoin
you buy a CFD contract, for example. The price of bitcoin and your balance, nomi-
nated from a broker in §, € or P, varies from the price direction of bitcoin.

If a brokerage is licensed as a market maker, it can quote such derivative by itself.
If brokerage works under STP license, it takes this liquidity from a liquidity provid-
er and hedges all orders on an external counterparty.

Aggregator B2BX

B2BX mechanism of work

How the CFD hedges. The more customers B2BX has, the easier it is to
hedge. It works this way: there comes a $100,000 order to buy bitcoin. The
aggregator checks: if for 0.1 sec. there is a counter transaction (counter
volume), then the transaction is matched with a counter order. If the
volume is partial ($50,000), then $50,000 matches inside, and the rest goes
outside and is hedged by counterparties at common prices. Therefore, the
more customers, the larger the counter volume.

There are big regulated brokers (i.e. IG Markets, Halifax, JFD brokers, FX Pro) to
which it is possible to deposit money in any customary way: by bank card, by bank
transfer, PayPal, Skrill, etc. They act as a security guarantor. This means that if the
deposit is $1 million, the company at any time can withdraw them back. People
just work with them open an account, pass the verification, make money — all
systems are established and working, and the market is formed. For traders and
investors, who want to buy a cryptocurrency in order to earn on the exchange rate
difference, there is no sense to work on crypto-exchange. It is much easier to go to
an adjustable broker — open an account — deposit money via card or bank — and
buy a bitcoin contract. If there is no task to store bitcoin on your wallet, then there
is no difference — you just buy a contract and your regulated broker acts as your
counterpart. Further action is to close the position when BTC grows in price.

While there are not so much liquidity and so many counterparties on the market
as in Forex, brokers even offer leverage, for example, 1:3. This means that the client
needs three times less money than the cost of cryptoactive.

E.g. You had $10,000. Then you bought bitcoins for $4,000 and bitcoin grew to $6,000.
As a result, you've got a profit of $5,000 — and closed the position. And if you bought
with a 1:3 leverage, when bitcoin grew from $4,000 to $6,000, you've earned $6,000
instead of $2,000.

There are crypto-exchanges where there is no regulation, where they do not accept
cards for deposit and even fiat money. If you do not have a cryptocurrency, then
you can not work with them. In this case, working through the usual brokers is a

very convenient alternative.

Huge hype around cryptocurrencies is growing and brokers are offering to invest
legally in bitcoin under their licenses. For example, CFD for cryptocurrency was
launched by our partners: JFD Brokers, Alpari, EToro and a number of other broker-
age companies.

Aggregator B2BX

B2BX mechanism of work

B2Broker made it possible: provided the opportunity for brokers to connect their
trading platforms to crypto-liquidity and we will continue to develop this trend.

B2Broker already aggregates liquidity from the 5 largest exchanges. A month after
the ICO, 35 small brokers and 5 mastodons of the industry will offer trading in
cryptocurrencies. This will be a good start for the aggregation and distribution of
liquidity. Further, we plan to aggregate applications from brokers and companies,
develop the market, create the largest aggregator of crypto-liquidity and, by the
end of 2018, to connect at least 200 brokers.

Exchange of the cryptocurrency for another cryptocurrency. Exchanging

will be available to institutional clients under the jurisdiction of Singapore.

B2BX Marketing Strategy

. Unique and market-demanded product. B2BX is available in the first working version.
After few modifications, it will be the first official provider of cryptocurrency liquidity
for margin and exchange trading and distribution of liquidity to brokerage
companies.

. Integration of B2BX with all industry aggregators. By this action we will get a
significant part of the market. By integrating and developing unifying connectors to
connect to any trading systems and platforms, our transparency will increase and we
will be able to distribute the product at a higher speed. Partners will contribute to the
development of our company, as trading turnover and their income from the
commission will also grow. In fact, these are affiliate sales: they sell our products and
are interested in our success.

. Listing of tokens of other ICOs on the B2BX platform. We plan to develop rules for
including tokens of prospective ICO projects to the B2BX platform. We will provide
liquidity for them to all members of B2BX. Thus, the ICO project that have included its
tokens to the B2BX platform will receive a lot of potential traders who will trade its
token. We also consider the possibility of exchanging B2BX tokens to the tokens of
other prospective ICO projects.

. We attend all important fin-tech exhibitions: iFXEXPO Hong Kong, iFXEXPO Cyprus,
London Finance Magnates Summit, Shenzhen Forex Expo, Shanghai Forex Expo,
Crypto summits, Consensus 2018, etc. This is one of the main channels that gives us
large institutional clients and partners.

. We plan to obtain all significant licenses. This will increase the level of authority and
trust in the market and will become our competitive advantage. As we grow, our
customers will become huge licensed companies (in our current portfolio we already
have 4 leaders of the industry).

. Active digital campaign. The attendance of b2broker.net is growing: the number of
leads per day has increased from 6 to 15 requests. We plan to expand the sales
department and increase the number of targeted leads to 40-50 per day.

. In addition to direct sales of ready-made products, B2Broker uses an agency model.
Many service providers do not have enough resources to offer their customers
similar services, so they resell our products under their brand using the White Label
scheme, or act as an agent for which they receive agency fees. With the access to
new markets, we will expand the network of resellers.

. We plan to open offices in main jurisdictions: London, Hong Kong, Dubai, Australia.
This will increase the local presence in these markets, increase the conversion of
sales and open markets that are closed to unlicensed companies in these regions.

. ICO is part of a marketing strategy that works to promote the company and the
products. With the help of ICO, we plan not only to raise funds for the development of
the project, but also to prepare the market for a new product.

The project will earn on commissions. Full information can be found in the Business Model.

For the project development we need:

We plan to provide both types of liquidity: physical delivery and
marginal. We will do the physical delivery exchange on the basis of a
Japanese company with a license, the margin type is based on CySec, ASIC, FCA. The
number of licenses of the company will depend on the success of the crowdfunding
campaign.

License obtaining is a time-consuming and financially-expensive process. It includes
payment of mandatory state fees and guarantee deposits, as well as a complex for the
creation, preparation and support of the legal structure.

Financially-cost stages:

Consultations and services of high-level specialists in finance and legal in each
jurisdiction. This is necessary for the qualitative preparation of documentation for
filing for a license and for creating an effective business model;

Company registration for each license in a particular jurisdiction;

Providing the company with professional management that meets the strict
requirements of the regulator;

Opening a physical office in each jurisdiction and hiring staff;

Opening bank accounts for the company in each jurisdiction;

Financial services for each company;

AML-support for each of the companies, including professional AML-auditors;
Conducting mandatory audits and providing their results to Regulators;

Annual renewal of licenses and companies.

The costs of supporting and preparing the legal structure for one year can be evened or
even exceed the cost of obtaining the license itself (compulsory payments and state fees
when applying).

Obtaining licenses in several jurisdictions is necessary for the operation of the B2BX
project in large local markets in accordance with the requirements of local regulators.
We observe a steady trend towards further regulation of the cryptocurrency market by
financial regulators (SEC, MAS, JFSA) and consider obtaining licenses as a necessary
step for the stable and qualitative provision of services to institutional clients.

To start the project, we need to expand the team of
programmers and technical specialists. We plan to cooperate with the best
counterparties, exchanges and liquidity providers.

It will be necessary to maintain the fault tolerance of the
technical base: aggregator, trading platform, bridge. We need funds to develop
and strengthen our products in the market: a cryptocurrency exchange turnkey, a
cryptocurrency broker turnkey and exchanger, forex broker turnkey, DMA liquidity,
Traders Room, PAMM/MAM/Social Trading. This will directly affect the quantity and
quality of participants in the B2BX exchange: brokers will more likely join the listing of a
company with professional products.

unpredictable situations so we can protect the participants’ funds and
transfer them to a more secure smart contract.

the security and keeps the personal accounts of the participants.

will be possible if there are 2 or more signatures of team members. It will be
publicly available to view data balances of these wallets.

3.6. Cold storage of a part of the collected funds to finance the project will be
organized on the basis of hardware wallets (KeepKey/Ledger). It will be
created a backup copy on physical media (flash drives) for each hardware
wallet and their backup copies. Hardware wallets and their backup copies
will be stored separately: one part in the safe of one bank, the other part in
the banking cell of another bank in another country.

ICO

Why do we need ICO

B2Broker conducts the ICO and attracts funds through the crowdsale to provide
B2BX with resources. When we collect the capital, the project will be launched at a
qualitatively different level. With our current resources and without ICO, we will
need at least two years only for the implementation of the first stage.

The ICO will contribute to the development of the technical base of B2BX and will
significantly increase the scale of the work with the cryptocurrency, increase the
speed of developing our own software, enable to connect the maximum number of
exchanges to the aggregator of cryptocurrency liquidity, help to obtain a Japanese
license to provide cryptocurrency liquidity, increase the sales staff and create
representative offices in the world financial centers.

Targeted allocation of funds. All collected funds will be accumulated on a sepa-
rately created B2Broker account. The distribution of funds for each stage collected
during the ICO is described in detail in the Business Model:

ICO

Using B2BX Tokens. The Active Participants Club and conditions
for calculating bonuses. Forecast for the growth of the B2BX Token

During the ICO campaign, 80% of the tokens will be distributed among the
participants. The B2BX token — is the utility token that will be used in the work of
the first official supplier of crypto-currency liquidity B2BX (hereinafter - "B2BX
platform’), as well as in other ways described below:

Starting from January 2018 the payment of commissions by all participants
- members of the B2BX ecosystem will be accepted exclusively in B2BX
Tokens. We anticipate that an increase in the number of participants of the
B2BX platform will lead to an increase in trade volumes and, accordingly,
the total amount of commissions charged on them. Thus, participants of the
B2BX platform will need to buy B2BX tokens and pay the B2BX platform
commissions using them.

If amember of B2BX platform does not have the opportunity to buy B2BX
Tokens at the exchange or elsewhere, we will provide the opportunity for
buying the necessary quantity of B2BX Tokens at the internal exchange. Thus,
an increase in the number of participants, in our opinion, will lead to an
increase in demand for B2BX Tokens and, as a result, an increase in their value.

2. Possibility to pay with B2BX Tokens the commission fees of brokers and
exchanges that will be participants of the B2BX platform ecosystem

For the participants-members of B2BX ecosystem we fix the cost of services
in fiat currency. As we forecast the growth of the B2BX Token rate, therefore
the B2BX Token holder, who acquired them now during the ICO by fixed cost
of 0,63 eurocent, will be able to save by paying commissions of participants

of B2BX ecosystem with B2BX tokens.

3. The opportunity to purchase products of the B2Broker company with B2BX
Tokens

This option is attractive for those who are thinking about creating their own
business and are interested in B2Broker products, for example,
crypto-exchanger, crypto-exchange or crypto-broker (except crediting of the
deposit for liquidity). The cost of b2broker products will be fixed in fiat
currency, and the B2BX Token holder, who acquired them now during the
ICO by fixed cost of 0,63 eurocent, will be able to save by paying the cost of
B2Broker products with B2BX Tokens.

. Opportunity to become a member of the Active Participants Club of the
B2BX project and receive a reward for active participation in the project

Within the B2BX project, the Active Participants Club will be created. Any
holder of a certain number of B2BX Tokens, which passes the applicable
KYC (Know Your Customer”) registration procedure, will be able to become a
member of the Active Participant Club. Specially for the Active Participants
Club, we plans to create an incentive pool, which will be credited by B2BX
Tokens monthly at the rate of 20% of the total commissions amount paid by
all participants of the B2BX platform.

The diagram describes the growth of incentive pool for Active Participants Club.
The data for calculation based on business model of B2BX project.

At the end of reporting period (every quarter) these B2BX Tokens will be distributed among all
Active Participants as a bonus for performing Active Projects, in proportion to the number of
existing B2BX Tokens owned by such Active Participant. Accordingly, the greater the number of
B2BX Tokens owned by an Active Participant, the higher percentage of Bonus it will receive at
the end of the reporting period.

Admission of applications for membership in the Active Participants Club will begin in December
2017. In order to carry out the "KYC" verification procedure, we will request certain data.

The term "Active Projects" includes the fulfillment of individual tasks in favor of the B2BX
project, depending on the role chosen by the Active Participant. A list of such Active Projects
and Roles is given below, but this list is not exclusive and may be supplemented in the future.
The same one Active participant can be registered only in one of the Active projects
simultaneously. Unfortunately, due to the peculiarities of the legislation, citizens of the United
States and the Republic of Singapore will not be able to purchase B2BX Tokens and become
members of the Active Participants Club.

Role of "Voting Participant". Holders of B2BX Tokens in an amount of at least 20 000 (twenty
thousand) will have the opportunity to express their opinion on the issues that are necessary
for the formation of the B2BX platform strategy and development plan. The opinion of the
Voting Participant will be recorded in the course of a special vote, which we will initiate at least
once a quarter in the form of a questionnaire for the Voting Participant in the personal account.
The results of such a vote will not be binding for us but will be taken into account when
choosing the way of B2BX platform development.

ICO

Using B2BX Tokens. The Active Participants Club and conditions
for calculating bonuses. Forecast for the growth of the B2BX Token

Active participants that perform the roles of Legal Consultant, Marketing
Consultant and Public Relations Consultant will receive tasks from B2BX Project
Coordinator at least once a quarter. To receive a bonus from the incentive fund,
such participants will have to provide confirmation of the fact that they have
completed the assigned task. Depending on the specifics of such a task, the
confirmation of performance can be:

« a copy or original of the required official document;

- document with analysis or illation in the format of Word or PDF;
- screenshot from the monitor;

« video recording of the event or video clip;

- other means of confirmation, which the coordinator deems necessary based on the specifics of the
assignment;

If there is no confirmation of the fulfillment of the task, the question of payout of
bonuses should be decided by the B2BX platform management on an individual
basis. At the same time, an Active Participant who does not submit a confirmation
of the fulfillment of the task, can be denied in payout of bonuses.

An Active participant receives a task from the B2BX project coordinator only in the
case the amount of B2BX Token is sufficient for his chosen role on the moment of
receiving of the task. If the number of tokens is insufficient, the Active Participant
can not be considered to be the performer of the selected role, but it can get a
different role which requires fewer B2BX tokens. At the same time, bonuses are
calculated in proportion to the number of B2BX Tokens at the moment of accrual
such bonuses.

Example. An active participant performing the role of Legal Consultant should have 10,000
tokens at the moment of the assignment of task. If at the moment of the assignment of task he
has only 5 000 tokens, he can no longer perform the functions of the "Legal Advisor", and can
register as "Marketing consultant" or "Public relations consultant." After receiving the task the
Active participant can sell his tokens, but he should take into account that bonuses will be
accrued in proportion to the number of tokens on his wallet at the moment of the accrual of
bonuses. That means the more tokens it will retain at the moment of accrual of bonuses, the
more bonuses he will get.

If the Active participants do not fulfill their roles or violate the rules presented to
Active participants (for example, it turns out that the participant is a citizen of the
country for which registration as an Active participant is not possible), then the
statuses of such participants can be withdrawn without accruing any bonus.

5. Turnover of B2BX Tokens at brokers and stock exchanges

In 6-10 months after the completion of ICO, we plan to add the B2BX Token to
all the most famous exchanges, and also to brokers and exchanges that will
become participants in our ecosystem. We also plan to add the B2BX Token
to all known aggregators, to which 400 to 1000 brokers are connected. In the
future, these brokers will be able to develop it on their exchanges and add to
all possible listings on key exchanges.

6. Listing of other ICOs Tokens on the B2BX platform

We plan to develop special rules for including tokens of prospective ICO
projects to our B2BX platform and provide liquidity on them for all
participants of the B2BX platform. Thus, a huge number of potential traders
get access to ICO projects that have included their tokens to our platform.
We also consider the possibility of exchanging B2BX Tokens to the tokens of
other prospective ICO projects.

We expect a great demand from other ICO projects for the services of listing of
their tokens on the B2BX platform. At the same time, the commission for trading
tokens of such ICO projects will be paid in B2BX Tokens, which will lead to an
increase in demand for B2BX Tokens.

Please note that our assumption about the growth of the token B2BX rate above is
only our professional opinion and is not a promise of such increase, promise of
profit or offer for investment.

The B2BX token will be added to the largest aggregator of the cryptocurrency
industry. Liquidity on it will be broadcast to all institutional customers of the
aggregator, and those, in turn, will broadcast the opportunity to trade B2BX tokens
to hundreds of thousands of retail customers.

Roadmap

During the ICO, B2Broker sets 5 targets:

Below are the key directions for allocating the project's target financing for the
next 3 years. When each goal is achieved, depending on the amount, the final and
intermediate goals will change. A detailed description of the distribution of funds,
can be found in the . All presented stages include the development
of all the previous ones.

Aggregation and distribution of cryptocurrency liquidity

We plan to create a decentralized ecosystem of the largest aggregators, ECN-plat-
forms, crypto-exchanges, cryptocurrency brokers, stock brokers, DMA brokers,
hedge funds, banks and other financial institutions. Liquidity will be distributed to
all participants through professional systems, FIX protocols and trading platforms.

Coinmarketcap data, new top crypto-exchanges will be connected to the B2BX
aggregator. To start the development of the aggregator, they will serve as a source
of volumes for the main cryptocurrency pairs and ensure diversification of risks of
crypto-exchange, liquidity risk and maximum liquidity.

About B2Broker

B2Broker is a software and liquidity provider for companies that want to launch
their brokerage or trading business. We make turn-key projects for start-ups and
big institutional clients. However, we can provide all products separately.

Since 2014, we have helped to launch (from scratch) 40 high-tech brokerage
companies in the UK, Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Czech Republic, Russia, Ukraine,
India, Australia and Cyprus. We have implemented a specialized software for
online trading and established an IT infrastructure.

We work in two directions:

1. Technology Solutions Provider. We are building a technological base: IT and
trading infrastructure for brokerage companies and other financial institutions.
We implement it according to the cloud distribution model of the SAAS product on
the basis of a monthly subscription and 24-hour technical support. We create
complex products, such as:

* Brokerage companies turnkey;

* Solutions for connection to liquidity providers;

* Cryptocurrency solutions;
etc.

Large brokerage companies choose our ready solutions because it's cheaper and
more profitable to give software development to professionals than to do it on your
own and spend years and money on developing systems that will not eventually
meet the market requirements.

2. Liquidity provider. We aggregate Forex and cryptocurrency liquidity. For the
aggregation and distribution of Forex liquidity, we use the best technological
solutions of the industry: Integral and Prime XM. For the cryptocurrency liquidity

we use our own software: B2BX aggregator.

This helps brokers save time and money. On average, the process of opening
account with liquidity provider takes 3 months. Moreover, if a broker wants to
connect to more than 10 liquidity providers and take, let’s say, 3 different types of
it, the broker should be ready to spend a lot of time, energy and money. With us, the
broker needs to sign one single contract, receive a single margin account and 3
types of liquidity: CryptoLiquidity, Forex\Spot and DMA Stock market liquidity.

We offer round-the-clock technical support in five languages: English, Russian,
Arabic, Chinese traditional and Chinese simplified. Currently we have 40
institutional clients working with us:

Conclusion

The B2BX exchange-aggregator for providing cryptocurrency liquidity for large
institutional clients is a segment in which there is still space for new projects. The
analysis of the state of the cryptocurrency market and actions of governments in
this direction indicate that our project is needed for the development of the new
economy.

The rapid implementation of the B2BX project will give an opportunity to become
the first in the formation of the market, take part in its development and make a
profit.

Several years ago we launched a conceptually similar project in the Forex market,
which is working successfully now. We have formed a professional team, base of
partners and advisors, the largest players of the market around the project. This
experience will allow us to repeat the idea on the market of cryptocurrencies,
adapting it to the specifics of the crypto industry, using current resources.

We will aggregate liquidity from the largest exchanges, then aggregate orders from
hundreds of brokers and companies, create a huge market and the largest aggrega-
tor of cryptocurrency liquidity. By the end of 2018, we are going to connect at least
200 brokers, and by the end of 2020, we will connect 5% of the brokerage market.

The purpose of the token release is to give acceleration to the project.

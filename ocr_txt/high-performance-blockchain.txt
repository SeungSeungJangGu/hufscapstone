Abstract

High Performance Blockchain (HPB) is a new approach to solving one of the most

critical problems facing all blockchains today: scaling.

Low transaction speeds and excessive latency plague blockchain networks around the

world, preventing widespread practical adoption by businesses and consumers.

HPB will solve this problem and meet true business needs by creating a platform
designed to handle millions of transactions per second. It will consist of both hardware
and software architecture, placing it ahead of current platforms which seek to solve the

same problem through software-only solutions.

With a target of 1 million TPS and a 3-second confirmation time, HPB aims to become
the standard for all major business applications in industries that require handling of

billions of data points with extremely low latency.
1. Industrial Background

1.1 Industrial Background

Blockchain is the foundational technology behind Bitcoin. It is also a potentially
groundbreaking innovation in how data is created, shared, and edited. Through an
immutable ledger and consensus algorithms that ensure the integrity of the blockchain,
it is possible to create a “trustless” type of information; a type that is truly decentralized

and transparent.

Many current uses of blockchain are restricted to its original purpose: as a peer-to-peer
cryptocurrency. However, it has numerous potential applications in several industries:
financial instruments, energy and resource management, social networking, big data and
IoT applications, governance protocols, advertising and marketing, and perhaps
completely new, unforeseen industries which may only be possible through

blockchain’s successful maturation.

Blockchain technology is still quite limited by a critical problem: transactions per
second (TPS).

1.2 Current Status of Blockchain Technology

Current major iterations of blockchain possess several problems:
¢ Transaction volume and applications are increasing
rapidly on current blockchains, making network
congestion a major issue

* Bitcoin, a legacy network, is confined to about 7 TPS.
Compared to Visa with an average TPS of 2,000 and a
maximum TPS of 50,000, it is extremely slow

« Even Lightning network aims for just 1,000 TPS, far
below existing industry standards

* Blockchains such as Ethereum have experienced security
breaches

* Community splits can lead to multiple hard forks,
leading to an increasingly splintered blockchain network

¢ There is still no real solution to a 51% network attack,
where a majority of mining resources are turned against
the network

2. Design Concept

HPB is a new blockchain architecture, positioned as an easy-to-use, high-performance
blockchain platform. It aims to extend the performance of distributed applications to

meet real-world business needs.
The software architecture provides accounts, identity and authorization management,
policy management, databases, and asynchronous communication on thousands of
CPUs, FPGAs or clustered program schedules. This is a new architecture that can

support millions of transactions per second and support authorizations within seconds.

BOE Acceleration Engine

— - _

As shown above, the architecture consists of two parts: hardware architecture and
software architecture. It is a fusion of the HPC (High Performance Computing)
blockchain concept, cloud computing, hardware systems with distributed core nodes, a

HPC-powered universal communication network, and a HPC-powered cloud platform.

In addition to network management, the architecture supports core node blockchain
standards, and consensus algorithm and blockchain task processing functions. The core

node includes a hardware acceleration engine embedded with software.
Through BOE technology, consensus algorithm acceleration, data compression, data
encryption and other technologies, the architecture can support millions of concurrent
users. The cloud terminal under this architecture can be a traditional PC, intelligent

terminal, or any other related machine.

3. Technology Overview

3.1 BOE

For traditional blockchain nodes, functions such as transaction broadcasting, transaction
verification, block broadcasting, and block packaging are all implemented on the
software level. The data connection between each node is a serial process, resulting in
problems such as complex network topology, long delay time and low serial processing

performance.

In response to the above problems, HPB created a new technological innovation:
Blockchain Offload Engine (BOE). The BOE is a heterogeneous processing system,

including hardware, firmware, and corresponding matching software.

To achieve high performance and high concurrency computing acceleration, this
heterogeneous processing system combines CPU serial capabilities and parallel

processing capabilities of FPGA/ASIC chips.

BOE Flow Chart

BOE Board Chart

The BOE is connected to other devices in the P2P network through Gigabit/10 Gigabit

Ethernet interfaces. The MAC module processes Ethernet data packets and interacts

with the TOE module. The BOE module implements the resolution of TCP and UDP

packets. To save CPU resources, the CPU is not required to participate in the process.
The BOE module is responsible for establishing encrypted communication channels

with other nodes through the TOE module.

It performs integrity checks, signature verifications, and account balance checks on
incoming transactions, blocks, and other messages. It also performs fragment processing
on the excessive block data to be sent, and encapsulates each fragment to ensure the
integrity of the received data. It collects statistics according to the received traffic of
each TCP connection. The BOE is designed to be able to provide corresponding
incentives for the contribution of the system, so as to attract more users to participate in

maintaining the network's operation.

3.1.1 ECDSA Acceleration

For security considerations, every transaction and block broadcast in the network
requires a signing and verification process. ECDSA, the Elliptic Curve Digital
Signature Algorithm, is currently the most mature and widely used digital signature
algorithm in the industry. However, pure software implementation methods are limited
to thousands of verifications per second on general computing platforms, which is far

from high-performance requirements.

The BOE acceleration engine with the embedded ECDSA module will significantly
improve this signature verification speed, aimed towards verifying millions of

signatures per second.

3.1.2 Hardware Random Number Generator

When data transmission is performed between nodes, an encrypted channel needs to be
established through a key exchange. To make the key exchange random number
completely unpredictable, a hardware random number generator is employed to protect

the reliability of the encrypted channel.

3.1.3 Data Fragmentation
In the case of high TPS, the amount of data transmitted between the nodes is far beyond

the endurance of current network infrastructure, which leads to slow data

-8-
synchronization. BOE acceleration engine adopts block data fragmentation broadcast
processing technology. Each block fragmentation contains a complete block header, in
order to easily broadcast newly generated blocks to all nodes and realize the fast

convergence of blockchain.

3.1.4 Network Performance

In the HPB network, one of the conditions to become a high contribution node is to
provide network bandwidth to the system. BOE technology is based on the hardware
level to achieve node connection traffic statistics. Through BOE technology, the
consensus algorithm can calculate the network bandwidth data provided by a certain

node.

3.1.5 Concurrency

The BOE acceleration engine can achieve considerable concurrency connections while
maintaining support for more than 10,000 simultaneous TCP sessions and processing
10,000 sessions in parallel. This will greatly reduce the number of distributed network
layers. Dedicated parallel processing hardware will take over traditional software serial
processing functions, such as transaction data broadcasts, unverified block broadcasts
across the network, transaction confirmation broadcasts, and so on. The session
response speed and the session maintenance numbers are more than 100 times that of

the general computing platform node.

3.2 Consensus Algorithm

To meet BOE technology’s requirements and simultaneously improve the secure
TPS!, the HPB consensus algorithm adopts an efficient two-tier election mechanism,

namely outer elections and inner elections.

> Outer elections: Adoption of node contribution evaluation indicators and select

1 Secure TPS refers to the TPS confirmed by several trusted nodes under efficient network coverage.

-9-
high contribution node members from a multitude of candidate nodes.

> Inner elections: Based on the anonymous voting mechanism of Hash queues,
the priority of high contribution node -generated blocks is calculated at each
block generation, and high contribution nodes with high priority have the right

to generate blocks first.

Thanks to the Lightweight Message Exchange Mechanism, the consensus efficiency of
the HPB consensus algorithm is far higher than others. At the same time, it also greatly

improves security and privacy.

3.2.1 Outer Election

The outer election phase is used to select high contribution nodes from a large number
of candidate nodes. To minimize network synchronization and make full use of the data
of each node on the chain, an innovative adaptive consistent election plan is adopted:

the “account” consistency guarantees the consistency of the outer election.

As shown in the figure on the next page, each evaluation indicator is built into the
block. Under the precondition of past account consistency, each high contribution node
can adaptively calculate the ranking of all currently participating candidate nodes. The
higher ranked candidate node will formally become a high contribution node in the next

round.

Adaptive Performance Index Evaluation System

The evaluation index of candidate node contribution includes the following factors:
> BOE hardware engine: Whether BOE acceleration engine is configured
> Network bandwidth contribution: Data throughput in a fixed history period.

> Reputation assessment: Node reputation assessment based on packed block and

transaction forwarding behavior and data analysis.

> Total holding time of node: Real-time statistics based on account information.

3.2.2 Inner Election

According to the design of the HPB consensus algorithm, the inner election is based on
the high contribution nodes. The goal is to efficiently find out the corresponding high
contribution node for each block, which includes three stages: nomination stage,

statistical stage and computing stage.

Nomination stage: At the beginning of each voting period, the BOE acceleration engine
generates random Commits. Each high contribution node submits the Commit, that is,
the blocks generated by the Commit along with the high contribution nodes are

eventually synchronized into the chain.

-1ll-
Statistical stage: At the end of each voting period, the high contribution nodes count the
Commits in the blockchain and create a voting Pool: (Commit:, Commitz, Commits,

Commits, ... Commitn)

Computation stage: When a block is generated, each high contribution node quickly
calculates the generation priority of the node in the block by using the fixed weight
algorithm of the Commits in the voting pool. The high contribution node with the
highest priority will obtain the block package right. Following the principle of
Verifiable Random Functions (VRF), other nodes verify the signature of the random
number and the address when the block gets into the chain. This not only ensures the
reliability, but also guarantees the unpredictability and the address privacy of high

contribution nodes.

The HPB consensus algorithm plan provides strict privacy - before the block is
packaged, the current node cannot predict the node that generates the next block - and

takes into account the security verification of high contribution nodes.

3.3 Application Services

3.3.1 Blockchain APIs

At the base layer of the blockchain, the system provides a series of blockchain data
access & interaction interfaces and uses JSON-RPC & RESTful API to support various
data applications and development languages. It supports multi-blockchain, data query,
transaction submission and other blockchain operations. In different business scenarios,
the interactive access interface can be further integrated with the privilege control

system.

3.3.2 Application SDKs

Application SDKs are comprehensive services for development in different
programming languages of comprehensive service function interface. It allows for the
execution of blockchain operations and functions, packet-based encryption, data
signatures, transaction generation, etc. It can be extended to integration of specific

business logic functions, and seamlessly support expansion and integration into various

-12-
business system languages. It will support Java, JavaScript, .NET, Ruby, Python and
other SDK languages.

3.4 Smart Contract

3.4.1 General Virtual Machine (GVM) Mechanism
The goal of HPB is to support a variety of virtual machines, and, over time, add new

virtual machines as needed.

HPB adopts a modular design. It supports multiple virtual machines, and adjusts the list
of supported virtual machines at any time according to market requirements. The
underlying virtual machine is combined with upper-level programming language
parsing and transformation to flexibly support the basic applications of the virtual
machine. Through customized API operation, the external interface of the virtual
machine can be realized, and can flexibly interact with ledger data and external data.
This mechanism achieves high performance of native code execution when running

smart contracts. A GVM supporting different blockchains is also implemented.

3.4.1.1 Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

EVM has been the most popular solution for existing smart contracts, and can also be
used on HPB. It is feasible that the HPB operating system's blockchain and EVM smart
contracts can run in an internal sandbox, and can interact with other HPB applications

with only minor adaptations.

3.4.1.2 Neo Virtual Machine (NeoVM)
NeoVM is actively being used for enterprise-level finance solutions and other
industries, and can be used with HPB. When future NeoVM users run into scenarios

requiring high-performance, they can interact with HPB with only small adaptations.

-13-
3.4.2 Smart Contract Lifecycle Management

The system handles full lifecycle management of each smart contract as digital assets,
including the complete controlled management of submission, deployment, usage, and
cancellation. Furthermore, with integration into the right management mechanism,

comprehensive smart contract management is successfully implemented.

3.4.3 Smart Contract Auditing
Smart contract auditing is achieved through secure auditing, a combination of
automated auditing tools and professional auditors. It goes a step further with automated

code review and formal verification, as well as integrated unit coverage testing tools.

3.4.4 Smart Contract Template
Through active adoption by several business models and processes within different
business domains, a general smart contract template is gradually formed, which can

support flexible configurations for a multitude of scenarios.

3.5 System Management

3.5.1 System Configuration

HPB’s technology adopts a combination of software and hardware.

The system architecture can be divided into four levels: hardware layer, hardware

abstraction layers, middle layers, and implementation layers.

The software and hardware versions of each layer need to be compatible with each
other. With regard to the complexity of the system, HPB provides system upgrade
services. Through simple command operations, various levels of compatibility checks,
automatic downloads, automatic upgrades, and automatic deployments can be

implemented.

-14-
3.5.2 System Monitoring

HPB provides the blockchain system, network and nodes with comprehensive
monitoring, logging visualization applications, and real-time activity alerts and
notifications. HPB supports the specific situations of remote fault recovery and network
system restart services. It also supports integrated monitoring and expansion according

to the requirements of different business areas.

4. HPB Economic Model

4.1 HPB Token Introduction
-  HPB token initialization total supply is 100 million.

- Based on the HPB consensus algorithm, a high contribution node (hcnode) has the
right to generate a block. Three necessary conditions for becoming a high

contribution node (henode) are:
e Adopt BOE hardware acceleration engine.
e Hold a certain number of HPB tokens.
e Contribute to the necessary network bandwidth for the entire system.

- After HPB launches its Mainnet, the high contribution node (henode) that generates

the block will receive HPB Coin rewards automatically issued by the system.

- The additional number of coin reward issued annually by the system is proportional
to the total number of high contribution nodes and candidate nodes. The number of

additional issuances does not exceed 6% per year.

6. Application Scenarios

6.1 Smart Big Data

Security and privacy remain as the key issues of development of big data. Practical
evidence shows that even harmless data, once collected in large quantities, poses the
risk of exposing personal data. In addition, big data may also encounter potential
security risks during storage, processing, and transmission. It is extremely difficult to
implement large data security and privacy protection, simply through technical means to

restrict service providers from collecting user information.

To find out the potential value of data sharing, we need to move toward a better solution

in managing data security.

Centralized IT systems provide advantages in terms of efficiency. However, frequent
data leakage, lack of transparency, and data incompleteness require a distributed
consensus mechanism to compensate for defects. HPB collects, uses, and authorizes
data through smart contracts to ensure data purity. Building smart big data solutions on
the HPB ecosystem will greatly enhance data security, privacy and availability.
Concurrently, the use of authorized transmission of data on the public chain and the

inquiry of transaction fees can be charged by HPB Coins.

After listening to the design concept of HPB, China's largest financial data company
UnionPay Smart has established a partnership with HPB. As a part of UnionPay,
UnionPay Smart is specialized in big data innovation business and currently handles

80% of China's banking transaction data, with an annual turnover of 80 trillion Yuan.

With the common goal of technological practice and exploration of big financial data
and high-performance blockchains, HPB is currently collaborating with UnionPay on
the authorization, certification, and traceability of big data. The tentative launch time for

this project is Q3 2018.

6.2 Gaming: Virtual Currencies and Items

The global gaming market reached US$109 billion in 2017. In addition to "F2P (Free-
to-play) games", the online gaming business generally consists of two types: users pay

to get in-gaming experience time or users pay to buy virtual in-game products.
Virtual game products are provided by a centralized service provider.

For commercial purposes, centralized service providers usually limit the transfer of in-
game products so that players can only use them on service providers’ proprietary

platform, but not in circulation across different platforms.

It is possible for some players to launch transactions on virtual in-game products
outside the gaming environment. However, information asymmetry can lead to tedious
transaction process and fraudulent issues. Players’ virtual in-game products may be lost,
confiscated or altered, while players do not have the right of recourse. In addition,
online games may also have a closed economic system, including production,

distribution, exchange and consumption. Thus, inflation and deflation are unavoidable.

If virtual in-game commodities and assets are stored on the blockchain, encrypted
digital currency such as HPB replaces virtual in-game currencies. Virtual in-game
products can then be conveniently transacted between players without the need of a
centralized game publisher, or a centralized organization such as Google Play or Apple

Store.

At the same time, decentralized virtual game currencies, and the sharing of the ledger
transaction flow, can introduce real-world scarcity to virtual-world assets, thus

introduce real-world value.

Through the hardware and software architecture design, HPB supports a stable million-

level concurrency and can be widely used in the online gaming industry.

6.3 Anti-Counterfeit Traceability

Information asymmetry results in difficulty in the traceability of products. Even with
anti-counterfeiting traceability technology such as bar codes and QR codes, single-way

traceability is gradually distorted in the communication process and counterfeiting

-20-
technology has constantly evolved and improved. Blockchain technology with
distributed ledgers, ledger traceability and its untraceable characteristics are naturally

suited for anti-counterfeiting traceability use.

HPB is currently exploring this field and is reaching initial cooperative intentions with

partners and related companies.

7. Summary & Outlook

Throughout the HPB design process, we thank not only the work of the HPB team, but
also the contributions and funding of partners, developer communities, and industry
organizations. We are very honored to receive the recognition and support of partners.
At present, various industrial companies have shown active cooperative intentions in

anti-counterfeit traceability, smart big data, and gaming industries.

We would like to express gratitude towards future participants in the development of the
HPB architecture, the technology community, business partners and blockchain industry
experts. We also sincerely invite technical and business partners to take part in the
common cause of development of an open source, high-performance blockchain

platform.

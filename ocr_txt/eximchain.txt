Date of Whitepaper: March 13th 2018 V6

ABSTRACT

Eximchain brings visibility to global supply chain finance
(SCF) through smart contracts. We build a public, permis-
sioned chain for small-and-medium enterprise (SME) buyers
and suppliers to create supply chain optimization tools and
gain access to affordable capital sources to grow their busi-
nesses. Our smart contract-based ecosystem allows SMEs to
quickly implement customized SCF solutions or issue digi-
tal tokens on a permissioned fork of Ethereum supporting
data privacy. We adopt a consensus protocol and quadratic
voting based governance model to provide practical, finite
time security guarantees on our public, permissioned block-
chain hybrid. From financing to procure-to-pay, our products
utilize smart contracts to optimize the global supply chain
for buyers, suppliers, and financiers. Eximchain is an official
candidate of the Blockchain Regulatory Sandbox Program
in Guiyang, China and a member of EEA (Enterprise Ethe-
reum Alliance).

1. ABOUT EXIMCHAIN

Eximchain project was kicked off in 2015 at MIT (Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technology) by a team with decades of
academic and industry experience in computer science, ban-
king and global supply chain across the world. Our vision
is to use blockchain technology to bring the global supply
chain into the digital era and lower financing barriers for
SMEs. The project has received valuable mentorship and
guidance from the MIT Media Lab Digital Currency Initia-
tive, MIT Center for Transportation and Logistics, and Plug
And Play Fintech Accelerator. The project was chosen as the
Grand Champion of the 2016 Boston Seagull Entrepreneur-
ship Contest, the Engine of Innovation Prize of the 2016
Rice Business Plan Competition, and a Finalist of the 2017
MIT $100K Business Plan Competition Accelerate.

2. SUPPLY CHAIN FINANCE OVERVIEW

Traditionally, supply chain management has focused on
the material flow of physical goods from manufacturers to
end consumers. However, the recent global economic down-
turn demonstrated that managing financial flows within the
supply chain can be as important as managing physical flows
of goods and services{1]. Supply chain finance (SCF), one
of the most exciting and promising new products emerging
in the banking industry, is a set of technology-based busi-
ness and financing processes that allow financiers to fund an
organization’s operations through its supply chain relation-

ships. SCF enables buyers to optimize working capital and
suppliers to generate additional operating cash flow while si-
multaneously minimizing risk across the entire supply chain.
More specifically, SCF enables buyers and sellers to shrink
their inventories, collect money from customers faster and
delay payments to their suppliers. Citi recently completed
a working capital study that showed companies managing
working capital through SCF were able to reduce these as-
sets by 30%, resulting in EPS (earning per share) increases
in the range of 1% to 4%. Furthermore, the top 10% of com-
panies that reduced their CCC (cash conversion cycle) were
rewarded with a 30% stock price appreciatio:

3. THE PROBLEM

According to the International Finance Corporation (IFC),
small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in developing coun-
tries face a financing gap totaling over $2 trillion|3]. In China
alone, the vast majority of the 40 million SMEs remain un-
served by existing financial resources|4|. This financing gap
is particularly concerning because, as cited by the World
Bank, SMEs contribute up to 60% of total employment and
up to 40% of GDP in developing markets|5|. Innovative SCF
solutions offer a powerful tool for SME buyers, suppliers and
financiers to overcome this funding gap Innovations in
this space have traditionally been driven by large corpora-
tions and banks in the field; however, cutting edge financi-
al technologies offer new opportunities to extend the bene-
fits of SCF to businesses of all sizes. According to a 2015
McKinsey Report, of the $20 billion potential revenue pool
that exists for implemented SCF programs, only $2 billion
is being captured today|7|. One primary issue inhibiting the
widespread adoption of SCF programs among SMEs is that
they currently lack a trusted tool that provides transparency
to eliminate information asymmetry problems. Beyond this,
there are quite a number of difficulties for adoption of SCF
programs on a global scale:

First of all, any supply chain strategy cannot be determined

in isolation. The market for SCF programs is inherently dy-

namic: exogenous factors, such as interest rates, and endo-
genous factors, such as inventory decisions and capital cons-
traints, influence the evolution of the system.

Furthermore, the complexity of implementing SCF across
the global supply chain limits its adoption. It takes tremen-

dous effort to onboard suppliers and integrate the process
with the existing operational flow by involving finance, pro-
curement, and IT departments inside the organization.
Last but not least, it is difficult to align incentives among
different participants. Suppliers, buyers and financiers are
independent decision makers attempting to maximize profits
in the face of asymmetric cost structures and uncertainties.
Such independent profit maximizations often lead to poor
performance of the entire supply chain.

The Eximchain platform solves these challenges by offering
seamless integration into the existing workflow of SMEs and
enabling developers to create customized tools for specific
businesses and industry use cases.

4. OUR SOLUTION

Eximchain offers a platform to implement smart contract
based SCF solutions on a permissioned fork of Ethereum
supporting data privacy. Our ecosystem will enable SMEs to
gain access to affordable capital sources by giving financiers
visibility into the supply chain cash flow. The first game
theory-based application we plan to build, Multi-Party
Dynamic Contracting*, (details to be described under
Appendix- Use Case Example) will be designed in such a
way that no partner can improve his profit by deciding to
deviate from the optimal set of decisions. That is, there is
no incentive for the buyer, the supplier, nor the financier to
deviate from the set of actions that will achieve the global-
ly optimal solution. The implementation is executed by the
consensus of the network in a standard, automated, priva-
te, and auditable fashion. From the user’s perspective, after
making the initial input and setting up the negotiation rule,
they can receive the negotiation result from a “black box”
where the system automatically executes an optimization
engine through multi-stage coordination until Nash Equili-
brium is reached and each participant’s incentive is aligned.

Buyers and suppliers can automate contracting processes
with the Eximchain network. Suppliers and buyers normal-
ly have different and conflicting objectives. For instance,
suppliers want buyers to commit themselves to purchasing
large quantities of products in stable volumes with flexi-
ble delivery dates. Conversely, buyers need to be flexible to
their customers’ needs and changing demands. The difficulty
with global optimization is that it requires firms to surren-
ler decision-making power to an unbiased decision maker.
Additionally, establishing trust between the supplier and
the buyer is difficult to achieve. For example ,in January
2013, the Walt Disney Company sued Blockbuster, accusing
them of cheating its video unit of approximately $120 milli-
o.
t.

n under a four-year revenue-sharing agreement]8}. Through
he Eximchain platform, buyers and suppliers can carefully
lesign supply contracts to maximize profit on the supply
chain with more visibility into demand, inventory and ups-
tream/downstream operations through a trusted and secu-
red network. Additionally, interactions and agreements are
saved automatically with a traceable record.

Financiers will be onboarded to the network with aligned
incentives. In the real marketplace, suppliers and buyers fre-
quently finance their working capital from a variety of credit
sources, such as banks, and incur significant financing costs.
Studies have shown that under the assumption of positive
inventory financing costs, traditional supply contracts fail
to achieve joint profit maximization|9]. Based on the limi-

ted information displayed in contracts, it is hard for banks
to understand the market expectation and real dynamic bet-
ween buyers and suppliers to mitigate risk. In 2014, a Chine-
se trading company, Dezheng Resources, and its subsidiaries
were alleged to have used duplicate receipts to pledge metal
as collateral for loans. The result was a flurry of lawsuits,
including the UK High Court case between Mercuria and
Citi, over exposure to a $270 million financing deal{10]. The
Eximchain platform provides access to smart contract histo-
ry between two parties, which grants banks more visibility
into the supply chain operations and enables them to bet-
ter estimate the risk of a transaction. Furthermore, access to
this smart contract information will provide other financiers,
beyond traditional banks and lenders, with an opportunity
to fund and generate value off of these transactions.

Eximchain allows developers to create variations on supply
contracts secured by the network and build solutions that are

customized to their global supply chain. Currently, supply

chain partners use a variety of solutions to align incentives
and mitigate inventory risk, including: buybacks, quantity
discounts, revenue-sharing and two-part tariffs contracts. On
the Eximchain platform, developers can build customized
solutions based on specific industry needs, user dynamics
and market competition. Banks and anchor buyers can easi-
ly scale the solution on the global supply chain by involving
upstream and downstream players. Although these solutions
will be varied, the contracting process will be highly stan-
dardized and can be seamlessly integrated into the bidding
process and other supply chain management tools.

5. VALUE FOR OUR STAKEHOLDERS

Financiers:

Risk Mitigation

We enable dynamic, real-time monitoring of supply chain
financing processes to provide visibility into the whole sup-
ply chain’s operations. Lenders can now better understand
the actions taken by end purchasers and upstream suppliers
of each deal to better assess risk. With the combination of
a “Purchase Money Security Agreement” (PMSA) [11]
so known as purchase money security interest, on the loan,
which makes the lender the first claimant of the collateral
related to the loan in the case of default, the financiers gains
a much better estimation on the risk and return of the in-
vestment despite all external uncertainties.

Operational Efficiency

With more information about the trade, the financier could
more accurately set the rating and risk factor. Increased
transparency over trade transactions tends to lower the risk
factor and thus risk equivalent, which improves efficiency
in operation and management of the loan. By digitalizing
and standardizing the contracting process, financiers save
the overhead effort of processing paperwork, understanding
different terms, and going through multiple levels of manual
review to make a final decision about the credit they are
issuing.

Investment Opportunity

In the traditional corporate financing scheme, the finan-
ciers would be banks, focused on assessing the borrower’s
historical credit, capital position, collaterals and guarantees
of the companies in the supply chain that they are providing
credit to. However, in the SCF view, financiers could be any
investor or anchor buyer who is capable of assessing and ta-
king the credit risk of the SCF product. Our solution will
lower the barrier to entry for financiers in the global supply
chain, and will allow institutional investors and accredited
individual investors who are looking for short-duration, low
risk and highly collateralized credit products to offer alter-
native funding sources to SMEs in the future.

Buyers and Suppliers:

Working Capital Management

By adopting our solutions, suppliers facing difficulties ob-
taining affordable credit will now be able to access capital
through banks or alternative sources. Capital-constrained
buyers who rely on direct financing from a financial instituti-
on can obtain trade-credit in addition to standard contracts
to subsidize their costs of inventory financing and improve
their working capital.

Given the lack of transparency of the supply chain, we see
that most SMEs rely on margin money deposits for bank
or factoring houses to get loans. For example,
in China, banks normally require 5-20% of the loan amount
as a margin deposit depending on the credit risk of a SME.
Fees charged by factoring houses can run as high as 15%
of the loan amount every year{13]. With the combination
of a PMSA and improved clarity on each deal, potentially

up to 15% of annual working capital loan for SMEs can be
unlocked either by paying less to cover margin deposits or
by eliminating the fee of the third-party guarantee company.

On the buyer side, a company with $10 million in revenue
and a 60% cost of goods sold (COGS) ratio can experience
a cash flow increase of $16.7k per day of extended paya-
bles ($10m * 60%/360 days=$16.7k). Parlaying that into a
60-day term extension on trade-credit would result in a po-
tential annual working capital/cash flow benefit of $1 million
for the buyer ($16.7k * 60=$1m).

Credit Rate Arbitration

The Eximchain platform enables anchor buyers to take ad-
vantage of their comparatively better credit ratings to offer
SCF programs to fund their suppliers in return for extended
terms, lower prices, and improved long-term relationships.
In this “buyer-driven” model, the anchor buyer becomes the
financier in the ecosystem.

For example, if a supplier’s access to capital is 5 percen-
tage points higher than the buyer’s 2.25% financing rate, a
simple calculation will show the buyer that a 30-day invoice
for $500k can be extended to 96 days without adding costs to
the supplier. On the other hand, if the buyer were to main-
tain the 30-day payment terms, the supplier could achieve a
reduced carrying cost of approximately $2,083( representing
0.4% of the $500k contract). Armed with this knowledge,
the buyer could negotiate a price reduction based on all, or
some portion, of these savings. For a company with $10 billi-
on in revenues and $600 million in COGS, even a 0.4% drop
would equate to $2.4 million in savings}14].

Supply Chain Optimization

The Eximchain platform also helps participants achieve
global optimization, without the need for an unbiased deci-
sion maker, by allowing them to share the supply chain’s risk
and the potential benefit. Below is an example to quantify
the value created for the supply chain based on a dynamic
contract between a supplier and buyer:

Assume the price of a product for the end customer is
$125 per unit, the wholesale price paid by the retailer to the
manufacturer is $80 per unit, the fixed production cost for
manufacturer is $100k, the variable production cost per unit
is $35, and any item unsold in the end has a salvage value
of $20. This implies that the retailer’s marginal profit for
selling a unit: $45, is smaller than the marginal loss: $60*.
The optimal order quantity depends on marginal profit and
marginal loss. So the retailer’s optimal policy is to order
12k units for an average profit of $470k as shown on below
graph Profit vs. Order Quantity. If the retailer places this
order, the manufacturer’s profit is $400k ((12k*($80-$35))-
$100k=$440k). Note that in this case, the retailer assumes
all of the risk of having more inventory than sales.

By using a Buy-Back Contract where the manufacturer
offers to buy unsold items from the retailer for $55, the re-
tailer’s marginal profit: $45, is now greater than its marginal
loss: $35, thus motivating the retailer to order more than
average demand. In this case, the retailer has an incentive
to increase its order quantity to 14k units, for a profit of
$513.8k, while the manufacturer’s average profit increases
to $471.9k. Thus, the total average profit for the two parties
increases from $910.7k, (=$470,7k+$440k) in the sequenti-
al supply chain to $985.7k (=$513.8k + $471.9k) when a
Buy-Back Contract is used. The Eximchain platform allows
the retailer and manufacturer (i.e. the buyer and supplier)
to share the additional $75k in profit generated from this
contract based on their consensu:

*_ Marginal profit/loss is the profit /loss of a firm or individual when one
additional unit is produced and sold. Marginal profit and loss determine the
optimal ordering quantity- the ordering quantity that gives the maximized
profit for a firm or individual.

Supply Chain Provenance

Using smart contracts and a token system, Eximchain can
expand the supplier-buyer-financier model and help buyers
to gain visibility over the whole supply chain by interacting
with upstream suppliers.

Process Automation

Eximchain helps to automate the negotiation and contrac-
ting process through private communication channels. Both
buyers and suppliers can stop wasting time on tracking the
supply chain process flow manually and will, instead, be ab-
le to maintain an audit of the final agreed upon contract in
real-time through Eximchain’s trustless network and secured
protocol.

6. ECOSYSTEM

Introduction

Eximchain streamlines complex multi-party transactions
in SCF by using blockchain to solve information asymmetry

problems. We recognize that partnerships and a minimum
viable ecosystem (MVE), rather than a minimum viable
product, are crucial to successfully bringing a new block-
chain solution to market.

MVE: The smallest configuration of elements that can be
brought together and still create unique commercial value

MVE

Combining a Blockchain, SDK, and Platform layer is ne-
cessary to bring enough players to bear for a healthy mini-
mum viable network. Eventually, others will be able to de-
velop solutions on our platform and make them immediately
available to parties on the chain. In order for a blockchain to
work, the computers on the system must validate and agree
that a transaction was completed. This is accomplished by
agreeing on a sequence of ’blocks’ which each contain a set
of transactions. BTC, for example, incentivizes participati-
on in consensus by rewarding the first user to propose and
validate a new block at each canonical height. Important-
ly, our design draws a distinction between nodes capable of
proposing and validating blocks.

Blockchain

Technical challenges with blockchain technology have kept
corporate players at bay. At the time of this writing, fur-
ther research and development for the full potential of this
technology to be realized are required on the Bitcoin and
Ethereum main nets. These are:

Scalability- All smart contract code must be executed
by all participants on the network.

Privacy- All information on a public blockchain is visible
to all participants to read.

Faced with the choice of waiting for Ethereum to end the
Ice Age[15] and release Casper in the coming years, or buil-
ding on recently produced viable solutions in this area, we
have chosen to leapfrog the Ethereum Roadmap by lever-
aging Quorum, an enterprise focused version of Ethereum
released by JP Morgan. Quorum allows us to leverage Con-

stellation{16] and a minimal Ethereum client fork to offer:

Confidentiality- private transactions secured by the net-
work

Performance- performance increases to handle the load
that complex private transactions place on the network.

Consensus- permissioned consensus and governance ru-
les to drive new economic incentives at the protocol level.

Quorum, and therefore Eximchain, is designed to develop
and evolve alongside Ethereum. Because it only minimally
modifies Ethereum’s core, we are able to incorporate the
majority of Ethereum updates quickly and seamlessly{17|

At the lowest level, we are modifying how the ethere-
um client protocol enables consensus and permissions the
blockchain. Our blockchain distinguishes between partici-
pants that can validate blocks and participants that can
propose blocks. The latter allows us to both secure priva-
te transactions on the network and incentivize developers to
participate in the evolution of our environment.

Other Dapes

Consensus

Rather than proof-of-work (mining), Eximchain uses a
vote-based consensus algorithm that forks QuorumChain to
add a few governance rules. The governance mechanism is
included in the appendix for completeness; implementation
details can be found

Settlement Finality

The recent development on Istanbul BFT (Byzantine Fault
Tolerance), which will be incorporated into Quorum, ensures
settlement finality and speeds up settlement time to under 1
second from the current tens of seconds to tens of minutes.

7. GOVERNANCE

The reason why Eximchain chose to use Quorum is becau-
se the current proof of work-based blockchains like Bitcoin
and Ethereum are not ready for enterprise-grade solutions
(details to be described under Appendix- Motivation). We
believe the incentives of developer pools, clients, and corpo-
rates contributing value to the ecosystem must be aligned
at the protocol level. This governance model can be applied
to other public, permissioned blockchains that are looking
to address similar issues.

Our proposed quadratic voting-based governance model
allows for a series of checks and balances between nodes. We
analyze how a voting system-based consensus model draws
a clear line between safety and liveness: the percent vote re-
quired for consensus trades safety for speed. We analyze the
counter balance of power between actors in the system, pro-
posing a model that discourages collusion and analyzes the
robustness of the protocol to keep block proposers and vali-
dators in check under: independent choice, coordinated
choice, and a bribing adversary. We conclude by ana-
lyzing several failure modes of the system and subsequent
recovery.

Voting Smart Contract|17]

Quorum Consensus Process Flow

Quorum Consensus Block Creation |17

Quorum Consensus Block Voting

Maker Nodes

Maker Nodes are responsible for proposing blocks and
their addresses are registered in the BlockVoting contract.
The initial set of Maker Nodes is pre-configured in the gene-
sis block and will be comprised of our initial token holders
who we expect will add strategic value to the project, howe-
ver once the network is established, this will begin to change
as described below.

Maker Nodes will have the responsibility of voting in a
new Maker Node every governance cycle. Nodes can opt to
become Maker Nodes if they are KYC approved and voted
in by an agreed threshold of existing Maker Nodes according
to the Quadratic Voting Governance Mechanism.

Validator Nodes

Validator Nodes help to secure the network and they are
also registered in the BlockVoting contract. They are re-
sponsible for voting to determine which block will be the
canonical hash at a particular height. Like Maker Nodes,
the initial set of Validator Nodes is pre-configured in the ge-

Registered Voter Nodes

Registered Voter Nodes tie real world identities of nodes.
All nodes (including Maker Nodes, Validator Nodes, and
other network participants) are required to register to vote
in order to participate in network governance mechanism.
Registered Voter Nodes will have the responsibility of voting
out a Maker Node every governance cycle and may be voted
in as Maker Nodes once the network is established.

Governance Analysis

It is important to consider the evolution of the system and
stakeholders in the face of dishonest nodes (traitors) and in-
centive driven collusion.

Recent developments in permissioned distributed ledger
technology (DLT) have enabled us to design novel consensus
rules that allow for a fundamental change in the underlying
incentive mechanism and actors that underlie the consensus
protocol of permissioned, public chains.

The desired outcome is to keep a cohort of dishonest no-
des from gaining control of the block proposal mechanism
or forking the chain, while bootstrapping a cohort of honest
nodes with vested interest to protect the network and punish
potential traitors. In the face of an undefeatable adversary
leading to mechanism failure we analyze the time, collusion,
and resources required for such an attack.

While not strictly necessary for the purposes of this ana-
lysis, it is important to keep in mind the real world identities
behind these nodes will largely represent corporate incenti-
ves in the global supply chain and development communi-
ties. Ultimately, we believe the incentives of these stakehol-
ders must be aligned at the protocol level. It follows that
developers have a vested interest and duty to secure the in-
frastructure their applications, clients and corporates rely
on. Similarly, clients and end-users have a vested interest
in ensuring honest development that improves the ecosys-
tem, as well as a vested interest in punishing freeloaders on
the network. The latter reflects our view that Maker No-
des should represent developer pools, motivating clients and
end-users to become Registered Voter Nodes to participate
in governance.

In all cases, while attacks on the network yield several fai-
lure cases, the confidentiality of private data stored on the
blockchain is preserved. That is to say, protocol or gover-
nance failure does not necessarily entail breach of security
to private data as long as private keys remain secure.

Adversary under independent choice

The consensus algorithm and governance is not fully open
to any client issuing commands. Under independent choice,
stakeholders have no incentive to deviate from the protocol
as their attack would be defeated by the network. Nodes
cannot single-handedly confirm the proposed block at each
canonical height. Maker Nodes who deviate from the pro-
tocol would reveal their intentions to the network, placing
themselves at risk of being voted off the Maker Node pool in
the next governance cycle. Both Maker Nodes and Validator
Nodes have a history of who voted them into the system, by
a majority Maker Node vote and by invitation respective-
ly; in this way the reputation of known traitors is linked to
other nodes on the system (and real world entities) visible
to anyone in the voting smart contract.

Adversary under coordinated choice

Assume an undefeatable, coordinating, racket of dishonest
nodes who by a series of governance cycles gain control of
a majority of block maker nodes that would allow them to
control block proposal to deviate from the protocol. The
consensus algorithm is not fully open to any client issuing
commands; taking control of block maker governance requi-
res traitors to be voted into the block maker pool.

Assume all nodes in the initial block maker pool of size k,
under irrational choice, consecutively vote into the pool: an
undefeatable coordinating racket of dishonest block maker
nodes of size, m, over a sequence of n governance cycles. We
analyze the cost, coordination and time required to launch
an optimal attack and fool the network.

Let b{1], b[2], . . . , b[n} denote the nodes added to the
block maker pool and s[1], s[2], . . . , s{n] the nodes removed
from the block maker pool over n governance cycles length
T. A k-strategy is a sequence that allows the coordinated
adversaries to control block proposal after a sequence of n
governance cycles by voting in m nodes without replacement.

(bl, sl) — (b2, s2) > ..... (bm, sm) ; m < n,

where worst case, m=n and m > 3 k, assuming a traitor
is added each cycle and an honest node is removed. If the
adversaries can assure the above, it is left up to the reader
to see coordination of the attack requires collusion of 3 k
nodes over a minimum attack duration, P = 5 kT before
our strong assumption of k honest initial nodes fails.

For a concrete example, k= 2048, T = 2 weeks , a perfectly
coordinated attack to control block proposal would take 26

years and coordination of 683 parties. Each must be ca-
pable of convincing honest nodes representing the developer
pools, clients, and corporates that they are contributing va-
ue to the system throughout the duration of the attack to
eep any of them from being voted out at each governance
cycle and extending the minimum attack period.

Undefeatable Bribing Adversary

Assume an undefeatable bribing adversary who by a set of
highly unlikely events, knows exactly which nodes will pro-
pose the next sequence of n blocks and the price required
to bribe each one to propose a tampered block. Assume all
nodes will commit treason for a price, the undefeatable bri-
ing adversary has resources k at his disposal, and is driven
y profit incentive. We analyze the cost of such an attack,
m, over a sequence of n blocks.

Let b[1], b[2], ... , b{n] be nonnegative integers that deno-
te the price required to bribe each block-proposer to confirm
the proposed block at each canonical height, over n blocks.
A k-strategy is a sequence that allows the adversary to con-
trol block proposal over a sequence of n blocks for a price m.

l<bl<sl<b2<s2<...<bm<sm<n,

where m is a positive integer less than or equal to k. The
profit corresponding to the strategy is the total reward ob-
tained if you bribe the network for b1, and profit sl from
controlling a fixed number of transactions for one block, bri-
bing the network for 2 blocks at b2, profiting s2 from con-
trolling a fixed number of transactions for two blocks, and so
forth. If the adversary can calculate the profit from control-
ling each proposed block p[1], . . . , p{n] it is trivial to design
an algorithm for the adversary to compute a k-strategy with
maximum profit.

Governance Level Attack

A similar k strategy could be designed to control gover-
nance over n vote cycles at cost m to an undefeatable bribing
adversary.

Our governance model is unique in that nodes have the
responsibility of periodically voting out Block Maker nodes
counterbalanced by block maker nodes being able to appoint
a replacement. We make an analogy to Block Makers as
generals and other nodes registered to vote as soldiers to
reason in laymen terms. You can say that governance level
attacks are part of the protocol and built into the system
to discourage majority collusion. Under similar assumptions
as above, we expect generals (Block Makers) to appeal to
soldiers (registered voters) to defend their status. A coalition
that controls over 3 of tokens could vote out any general
they chose, we expect this to incentivize generals to spin up
soldiers in their control to defend their status the only way
the protocol allows: by voting out another general not in
their coalition, simultaneously improving network security.

Governance Hardening

Assuming an initial token supply of X tokens, we analyze
the case where an adversary owns X-1 tokens and is att-
empting to gain control of the governance mechanism. We
analyze the minimum cost of controlling a sequence of n
governance cycles with length T of an undefeatable attack
strategy. We analyze the cost and time required from an
undefeatable adversary to maintain control of the network.
Our governance model implements quadratic voting ma-
king the cost of each v votes for a governance decision cost v?
tokens, all tokens paid are then redistributed equally among
the voting pool. To assure control of the first governance
cycle, the adversary must place 2 votes at a cost ofl}? =4
tokens, controlling X- 5 of the token supply in the second
cycle, to assure control of the next cycle, the adversary must
place 6 votes at cost v[2]? = 36 to beat the possible 5 votes
against his governance decision; this can continue to scale
this way until v[k] where the marginal cost of k nodes vo-
ting against the adversary increases:

(votes1, costl) —> (votes2, cost2) ... + (votesn, costn)

By correctly parameterizing the system it is possible to
prove an adversary can control a bounded number of gover-
nance cycles that can be defeated by k honest nodes.

Counter Measures

The premise of attack from a bribing adversary is a valid
concern if we are to expect the value of the network to scale
as the square of connected users [Metcalf’s Law]. Perhaps
unsurprisingly, distributed concentrations of wealth and a
smaller block size discourage bribing people to deviate from
the protocol for profit incentive. In practice, the non deter-
ministic choice of block proposers using random timeouts
limits the calculation of such a k-strategy by an undefeata-
ble bribing adversary. The cost of the k-strategy to launch
a governance or protocol level attack scales inversely to the
percentage of validators required for block confirmation and
number of nodes on the network. Our proposed governance
model allows for a series of checks and balances between no-
des. We are experimenting on mechanism design trade offs
on our testnet and will make our results public in the coming
year.

Bootstrap Mechanisms
QVEC- Quadratic Voting on Ethereum Chain

Peacekeepers

These are k = safety_factor * initial_token_holders_partici-
pant nodes originally launched as block makers to defend the
network and are registered in the voting contract as part of
the bootstrap mechanism; these nodes participate in con-
sensus but are forced to abstain at each governance cycle.
They will be first to be voted off the block proposer pool
to make room for new Maker nodes, allowing the ecosystem
to become fully decentralized over time while ensuring the
minimum attack period of an undefeatable adversary cannot

be realized in the infancy of the network.

Quadratic Voting

Nodes can make v votes for a governance decision by pay-
ing v? tokens, from there it’s just a majority vote. All funds
raised are returned by giving back to each individual in the
voting pool,1/(voting_pool-1) of the funds paid by the vo-
ter. The theory is that if someone gains x from a decision
being made, and each vote has a probability p of being pi-
votal, then they have the incentive to keep buying votes for
as long as the price of the next vote is less than px. Because
the total price of v votes is v?, and we know from calculus
that the derivative of v? is 2v, users will have the incenti-
ve to keep spending tokens until 2v > px; hence, they will
spend v = px/2 tokens. You can see from this math that the
number of tokens that a voter buys should be proportional
to x, ie. the amount that they gain from the decision being
made. Hence, the number of votes that a voter makes should
actually reflect the strength of their preference, and not just
which option they prefer.

Finite Attack Window

It would be irresponsible of us to claim undefeatable ad-
versaries are unlikely in practice* or claim that the proto-
col will defend the network indefinitely, rather we choose to
err toward practical guarantees that ensure network safety
by attempting to bound the minimum attack period and
cost of an undefeatable adversary. It follows shortly that
given an unbounded amount of time a determined enough
undefeatable adversary would eventually be able to launch
a successful attack. The only way to hedge against this is to
ensure a finite possible attack period in a similar time scale
to the minimum attack period of an undefeatable adversary.
In 100 years, the voting contract will suicide halting all fur-
ther change of state in the network, triggering open-source
licences on any remaining proprietary portions of our soft-
ware.

8. APPLICATION

At a higher level, we are creating a smart contract SDK.
The smart contract SDK layer will allow developers to build
applications from basic components, accelerating develop-
ment of future SCF solutions.

We want to enable the engineering of monetary systems
and make implementation of monetary theory, economics
and law accessible to developers. The first step is enab-
ling the implementation of systems that can be reduced
to modeling the strategic interaction between two or mo-
re players,specifically in situations containing a set of ru-
les, outcomes, and desired objectives. Participants can build
supply chain applications on top of the Eximchain smart
contract SDK:

Our aim is to show developers how our SDK easily sup-
ports complex multi party transactions, enabling them to
build applications and other supply chain finance products
on top of our ecosystem.

Smart Contract SDK

Financing: Through instant and transparent proof of or-
der verification on blockchain, suppliers seize early payment
discounts to improve working capital and buyers seize credit
arbitrage opportunity.

Procure-to-Pay: Participatants can maintain an audit of
the final agreed upon contract in each step of the procure-
to-pay process in real-time through a trustless network and
secured protocol.

Sourcing: Sourcing platforms or rating agents can use the
Proof of Existence (PoE) functionality- document time stam-
ping, verifying document integrity, demonstrating data ow-
nership without revealing data, to provide independently ve-
rifiable reputation data.

Inventory Management: By sharing real-time demand in-
formation cross the supply chain, participants can make bet-
ter inventory plans and automate the reconciliation process
across different ledgers and systems to save time and reduce
cost.

Supply Chain Optimization: Using Multi-Party Dynamic
Contracts - a combination of private channels and a confi-
gurable state machine to coordinate a confidential bi-level
stackelberg SCF negotiation (as described in Appendix).

Supplier Management: Using smart contracts and a token
system, Eximchain can help buyers to gain visibility over the
whole supply chain by interacting with upstream suppliers
but still maintain privacy on each transaction level.

Risk Mitigation: Eximchain enables dynamic, real-time
monitoring of supply chain processes to provide visibility
into the whole supply chain’s operations. Participants can
manage risks in one place.

Private channels

Series of confidential two way channels coordinated by the
FSM (Finite State Machine).

FSM

Coordinates rules and implements mechanisms modeling
the strategic interaction between two or more players. Takes
the shape of coordinating information exchange between a
number of two way private channels through a semaphore
notion and embedded mechanism design.

Strategy Computation Machine

We consider the design of Computational Game-Theoretic
Frameworks - machine games, where we replace strategies by
Turing machines (smart contracts For example, given
the state of a game, a strategy computation machine may
return a distribution over possible actions, the complexity of
the computation depends on implementation of the machine
but the interface can be clearly defined.

10. TOKEN AND PARTICIPATION

Eximchain Platform Native Tokens (Eximcoins) will be
used to pay network fees, validate state changes, and execu-
te governance. Eximcoins will also be used to access appli-
cations built on the Eximchain network developed with the
Eximchain SDK.

Token Structure

Because Eximcoins will be native to the permissioned fork
of the Quorum blockchain which will be integrated into the
Eximchain platform and will only be available when the
platform is deployed for commercial use (Mainnet Launch)
(which is expected to occur in Q2 2018), Eximchain plans to
sell a digital token native to the Etherium blockchain that
will be a precursor to Eximcoins (EXC Tokens) (the sale of
EXC Tokens, "Token Sale”). EXC Tokens will be ERC-20
compatible tokens distributed on the Ethereum blockchain
pursuant to a related ERC-20 smart contract. Shortly befo-
re Mainnet Launch, EXC Tokens will be permanently frozen
and not capable of being used for any purpose, in prepara-
tion for being converted into Eximcoins. Each EXC Token
will be automatically converted to one Eximcoin at Mainnet
Launch.

Total supply of EXC Tokens: 75,000,000
Fundraising target: US$20m equivalent

Token Distribution

Token distribution:
Sold during Token Sale: 60,000,000
Bonus Account (including airdrop): 15,000,000

Sold during Token Sale: No more than 60,000,000 EXC are
to be sold to buyers. Each token will be sold for the ether
equivalent of approximately US$0.33. There will be no bo-
nus or discount available to contributors during the Token
Sale.

Bonus Account: 15,000,000 EXC Tokens from the total
EXC Token supply will be allocated to a bonus account.
Approximately 10% of the EXC Tokens in the bonus ac-
count will be allocated for an Airdrop, as described below.
The remaining EXC Tokens in the bonus account will be
reserved for distribution by Eximchain in its discretion to
marketing and community partners during the EXC Token
generation event and participants in the Eximchain Bounty
Program.

Airdrop: In conjunction with the private sale, Eximchain
plans to conduct an airdrop of EXC Tokens to persons who
were placed on a whitelist of persons who expressed an inte-
rest in purchasing EXC Tokens but who did not participate
in the private sale. Eximchain will deliver a small quantity
of EXC Tokens (valued at about US$200) to each such per-
son for free.

Conversion of EXC Tokens to Eximcoins

Shortly before Mainnet Launch, the EXC Tokens will be
permanently frozen and not capable of being used or trans-
ferred for any purpose, in preparation for being converted
into Eximcoins. At Mainnet Launch, all EXC Tokens will
be automatically converted to Eximcoins on a one-for-one
basis. An additional 75,000,000 Eximcoins will also be crea-
ted and distributed at Mainnet Launch, as follows:

o 30,000,000 Eximcoins will be allocated to a promotional
account that Eximchain will manage to promote the use of
the platform by SMEs and early adopters to be selected by
Eximchain in its discretion over a 10-year period. It is im-
portant that Eximchain token holders plan to use our sup-
ply chain solutions and participate in the early stages of the
Eximchain governance mechanism. Eximchain will distribu-
te Eximcoins from the promotional account as an incentive
or early stage participants who will use the Eximchain plat-
orm to conduct contract negotiations, build supply chain
products and participate in network governance. SMEs in-
terested in applying for tokens to cover development and
prototype phases will need to sign a Commitment Letter or
Letter of Intent to qualify.

o 30,000,000 Eximcoins will be distributed to the Exim-
chain founding team and advisers.

o 15,000,000 will be allocated to a reserve account that
Eximchain will manage in its discretion to assure there are
sufficient Eximcoins in circulation for use on the platform.

The Eximcoins allocated to the promotional account will
be locked (incapable of transfer or use) and will be unlocked
during the 10-year period beginning at Mainnet Launch in
equal monthly allotments.

The Eximcoins distributed to Eximchain’s team and ad-
visers will be locked and will be unlocked during the 4-year
period beginning at Mainnet Launch in equal monthly al-
lotments.

The Eximcoins distributed to the reserve account will be
locked and will be unlocked at the end of the 2-year period
beginning at Mainnet Launch.

Token Sale Timeline

Token Sale: Q1 2018
Mainnet Launch and start token listing process: Q1-Q2 2018
List tokens on multiple exchanges: Q2-Q3 2018

Use of Funds

Eximchain intends to use the funds from the sale of EXC
Tokens at the Token Sale for the following primary purposes:

Platform Development: This includes maintaining compe-
titive salaries for top talent in China and the U.S. paying for
software hosting, accelerated development of legacy system
integrations and acquisition of hardware. The hardware and
hosting will be offered to anchor buyers and that will need
stand- alone computers to manage their respective supply
chains on a global scale.

Build the Supply Chain Ecosystem: This includes effort to
onboard SMEs through incentivizing early stage users and
on-going business development to onboard suppliers, buyers
and financiers. Eximchain will reserve a proportion of tokens
for this purpose in a secured wallet to ensure fair distribu-
tion.

Operational Expenses: This includes basic operational costs
such as office space, legal costs to pursuing and obtaining re-
quired licenses, and security measures.

However, Eximchain may in its discretion use those pro-
ceeds for any purpose, whether or not consistent with the
foregoing. Eximchain makes no undertaking, representation
or warranty in respect of its use of such proceeds.

Participation

Eximcoins will only be minted in the genesis block, asso-
ciating them with the wallet addresses of the holders of EXC
Tokens. EXC Tokens will only be minted while the contract
is active.

The private sale registration was closed on Jan 11th 2018.
In conjunction with the private sale, a total US$500k worth
of EXC Tokens are available for airdrop. Only participants
on the whitelist can join the airdrop process. The Token Sa-
le KYC process is scheduled to continue through to March
2018. All participants in the Token Sale, including airdrop
participants, must complete our KYC-AML process.

The whitelist registration was closed on Jan 16th 2018.

We invite engagement and dialog on our business model
and our ecosystem design. The opportunity that these tech-
nologies will unlock for businesses of all sizes is remarkable
and we need public involvement to fulfill that mission.

13. APPENDIX

Use Case Example
*Multi-Party Dynamic Contracting

Inspired by the system proposed in “Optimal bi-level Sta-
ckelberg strategies for supply chain financing with both capital-
constrained buyers and sellers”|21] and “A partial credit gua-
rantee contract in a capital-constrained supply chain: Finan-
cing equilibrium and coordinating strategy,” below we
provide an example of a Dynamic SCF system that can be

created through the Eximchain platform.

In the supply chain financing system shown, we formulate
the interactions between the capital-constrained buyer (Re-
tailer), the capital-constrained supplier (Manufacturer) and
the financier (Bank) as privately executed smart contracts
that coordinate a bi-level Stackelberg game. The Bank acts
as the leader in setting the financing rate for the Manufac-
turer and Retailer. The Manufacturer acts as the subleader
to make the best response according to Bank’s decision and
to set the wholesale price for the Retailer at the same ti-
me. The Retailer acts as the follower to respond to both the
Bank and Manufacturer.

Firstly, the leader (Bank) will evaluate the Retailer’s and
the Manufacturer’s financing conditions (e.g., initial capital,
bankruptcy risks and procurement/production quantities)
and make optimal decisions to announce the interest rate
Rr and Rm, respectively. Then, in response to the Bank,
the subleader (Manufacturer) will simultaneously update his
decision and decide how much to charge the buyer for the
wholesale price w. Acting as the follower, the Retailer de-
cides how much to order according to Bank’s interest rate,

Rr, and Manufacture’s wholesale price. To pursue the result
of the Stackelberg equilibrium, Retailer and Manufacturer
select a best-reply policy, denoted by (4) and (5).

The Eximchain ecosystem involves a single shared block-
chain and a smart contract SDK. Besides the model mentio-
ned above, our software architecture is tailored to implement
many SCF products from basic components on our ecosys-
tem. Ultimately, developers can use our software to create
variations on Stackelberg Strategies or their own multi party
SCF products.

MOTIVATION

As of writing, large mining pools control and secure proof
of work based blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as the
systems shift toward transaction based economies, and proof
of stake respectively, the financial incentive provided to de-
vote a large amount of hash power or coin holdings to secure
the network will drive decentralized networks into the palms
of a handful of mining pools. We believe it is important to
distinguish the value these pools contribute to the chain by
devoting resources to add security to the network, from the
value developers contribute by adding novel functionality to
the ecosystem.

Recent developments in permissioned-DLT have enabled
us to design novel consensus rules that allow for a funda-
mental change in the underlying incentive mechanism and
actors that underlie the consensus protocol of permissioned,
public chains.

We propose a system that grants developers, and mem-
bers of our Token Generation Event a privileged position in
the consensus protocol of the underlying blockchain, incen-
tivizing and funding developer pools to add functionality to
the system by allowing them to exclusively collect network
rewards at the protocol level from state changes driven by
Dapps on the network.

Today*, Ethereum and Bitcoin stakeholders (as a whole)
keep mining-rigs humming to the tune of $5M and $6M per
day respectively. Bitcoin, touted as the prime example of
successful dPoW is majority controlled by a handful of mi-
ning pools, with no roadmap to alleviate the centralization
of hash power. While the case is similar for Ethereum at
present, we will have to wait and see how their transition
to security deposit based dPoS will affect the distribution
of block proposers and whether token holders begin to bond
their ETH (which brings up peripheral concerns about ille-
gitimate initial token holders who will have a huge incentive

to raise as much ETH as possible).

Considering a 66% attack is possible in both networks un-
der collusion of less than 10 parties, it becomes clearer that
the security of these ecosystems are largely hinged on the
bounties available to these miners each day, none of whom
contribute to the codebase of the underlying system that
enables the creation of this value. The result is that mining
pools have complete control over how the system evolves;
in these networks, developers are second class citizens, con-
stantly at risk of forks in a network that their applications,
clients, and corporates rely on, forks that are ultimately de-
cided by the mining groups profiting from their innovation
and market speculation. Perhaps due to the latter, these
networks look more like security rackets every day, where
each additional dollar of network incentive gives you less se-
curity than the last dollar*. A new protocol is necessary to
align network incentives with those of developers, clients,

and corporates.
*consider that only 5 months ago Ethereum miners were getting paid
$500k/day to secure the network compared to today’s $5M/day

Consensus + Token FAQ

The token functions to keep the network incentivized to
participate in consensus and governance. Our native token’s
primary use is to pay gas, a mechanism used to incentivi-
ze Block makers to process your transactions. Further all
nodes registered to vote can make ’passive income’ (don’t
particularly love the term) by participating in governance
system via quadratic voting. 1000 EXC min required to par-
ticipate in consensus mechanism, as a masternode, but note
that this is not exactly PoS: nodes can be voted off the con-
sensus mechanism irrespective of their wealth via quadratic
voting governance. Masternodes are required to have 1000
EXC collateral, a dedicated IP address, and be able to run
24 hours a day without a more than a 1 hr connection loss,
they claim 100% of the transaction fees in blocks they make.

1. Introduction

INTRODUCTION Blockchain, the underlying technology of Cryptocurrency and its future
WIXLAR applications in global economy, in business and generally in all areas of our
were ae society is well recognized today.

WIXLAR ROAD MAP. In this paper, we analyze the advanced technology of Blockchain and its

uses for both online and offline services of the Wixlar Cryptocurrency.
Wixlar Services are considered the next revolution in enhancing the
applications of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain technology.

—s Introduction to BitCoin and Crypto Currenices Concepts

diel Bitcoin, the first Cryptocurrency was developed in 2009 by Satoshi
Nakamoto, to be used as an internet currency with variable value that is
based on the supply and demand in the market. Bitcoin succeeded in
providing its network of users worldwide with certain advantages such as
anonymity, faster transactions, very low fees and added security through
utilizing Cryptography.

The most important part of Bitcoin is its network is decentralized and all
network transactions are verified and processed using Blockchain
technology.

All transactions are converted into blocks of data that have been verified
among its users or nodes in the network. This innovation allowed many
developers to cite alternative applications of Blockchain technology using
digital tokens as assets in order to represent other assets or coins with
enhanced financial processing or transaction protocols.

Wixlar Group is intending to enhance the performance of transactions by
using an enhanced hashing algorithm for encryption decryption to provide
more secure transactions, faster and with lower fees. This allows its users
to be able to solely rely on Wixlar Coins to do their business online and
offline in confidence in a safe secured way.

History

TThe decentralized digital currency concept has been under study for
decades to find a way to transact without the need for a central authority
or third-party involvement for trust and security.

BitCoin as the first Cryptocurrency succeeds in providing anonymous
transactions without exposing the identity of the sender or receiver and
led to an innovative fast practical and inexpensive way to provide security
to its users and expand globally. It gives the opportunity to billions of
people around the world that are outside the current Fiat monetary system
because of personal circumstances to be included in the global economy,
participate and contribute to our society.

There were numerous attempts at solving the puzzle

Anonymous Electronic Cash Protocols

The anonymous 1980s and 1990s electronic cash protocols were mostly
dependent on a cryptographic primitive called Chaumian Blinding that
provided new currencies with privacy control, however their underlying
protocols failed to gain attraction because they were dependent ona
Centralized Authority potentially compromising security.

Money through Solving Puzzles

In 1998, Wei Dai b-money succeeds to become the first proposal to
introduce an innovative idea on creating money by solving computational
puzzles and decentralized. The proposal however failed to progress
because it did not show how a decentralized environment can be
implemented.

Reusable Proof of Work

In 2005, Hal Finney introduced a new concept of "reusable proofs of work"
which is a system that uses combined ideas from b-money and Adam
Back's computational Hashcash puzzles in order to create a new concept
for Cryptocurrency. The attempt failed because it relied on trusted
computing mechanism as a backend.

Satoshi Nakmoto and BitCoin

In 2009, BitCoin was the first decentralized currency that was implemented
in practice by Satoshi Nakamoto and it combined primitives to manage the
ownership of BitCoins using public key Cryptography with a hashing
algorithm to keep track or a Blockchain of who owns coins, known as
"proof of work."

Hashing Algorithm

Hash Functions MD2, MD4 and MD5 are meant for digital signature
applications where a large message has to be “compressed” in a secure
manner into a shorter message. They are used for hashing Digital
Signatures into a shorter value called a message-digest and the Secure
Hash Algorithm (SHA) is similar to the MD4 as a standard algorithm that
makes a larger 60-bit message digest.

Proof of Work and Proof of Stake

Proof of work solved two main problems which are provided simple
algorithm that allows network nodes to vote or verify some updates of
the Bitcoin ledger and allowed a free entry to this process to solve the
problem of who gets to influence the consensus with preventing attacks.

Proof of work solved two main problems; it provided a simple algorithm
that allows network nodes to vote or verify some updates of the Bitcoin
ledger and it allowed a free entry to this process to solve the problem of
who gets to influence the consensus while preventing attacks. Proof of
work succeeds in that by substituting a formal barrier to participation,
such as each single node power in the verifying process being dependent
on the computing power that the node brings.

After that, a problem of huge power and electricity fees began to appear

in order to continue working with the proof of work which led to a new
alternative approach called proof of stake that is calculating the weight of

a node according to its currency staking or holding only which means more
power and electricity savings

Transactions

Each Transaction is taking place using a wallet (web wallet, Windows
wallet, APPLE Wallet, Mobile Wallet) as a block in the Blockchain to be
verified or voted among the nodes in the network, that is the Miners work
in the Proof of Work and Stakers work in the Proof of stake.

Verifying Nodes

Transactions can be processed in less time by people who are interested
in mining and staking and allow themselves to become verifying nodes in
the network to gain some profit which makes the network alive as long as
there are active nodes in the network.

Block Explorer

Anyone can check the blockchain and the number of blocks processed
through the Block-Explorer but for security reasons, no one can know the
exact owner or receiver of any transactions which provides privacy and
anonymity for network users.

2. Wixlar

After twelve years of experience in business trades with global companies
and seven years of Cryptocurrency research, Wixlar Group Co. LTD decided
to launch Wixlar Coins a Hybrid POW/POS decentralized Cryptocurrency
with an enhanced secured hashing algorithm to become one of the easiest
ways to make safe transactions with small or big businesses or using Wixlar
Coins to buy or sell any products or services online and offline.
https://wixlar.com

Wixlar Coins API

Wixlar Coins API allows developers to add Wixlar Coins as a local or global
payment method using credit cards. More than 100 businesses are starting
their co-operation with Wixlar Group to accept Wixlar Coins in their normal
business.

Business and traders accepting to buy or sell their products or
services using Wixlar Coins means more reliability, success, higher value
and better future.

Enhanced Hashing Algorithm

Wixlar Engineers came out with the right idea of enhancing the Hashing
Algorithm by using the TrapDoor Hashing Algorithm combined with El
Gamal Key Signature in order to provide an enhanced characteristic of the
transactions module for Wilxar Coins thus providing an advanced security
layer for the Public and Private Keys used in the system.

This enhancement is considered like a whole new breakthrough into the
Blockchain technology and would open the door for more researches in
the near future.

Abstract: Venus Protocol (“Venus”) is an algorithmic-based
money market system designed to bring a complete decentralized
finance-based lending and credit system onto Binance Smart
Chain. Venus enables users to utilize their cryptocurrencies by
supplying collateral to the network that may be borrowed by
pledging over-collateralized cryptocurrencies. This creates a
secure lending environment where the lender receives a
compounded interest rate annually (APY) paid per block, while the
borrower pays interest on the cryptocurrency borrowed. These
interest rates are set by the protocol in a curve yield, where the
rates are automated based on the demand of the specific market,
such as Bitcoin. The difference of Venus from other money market
protocols is the ability to use the collateral supplied to the market
not only to borrow other assets but also to mint synthetic
stablecoins with over-collateralized positions that protect the
protocol. These synthetic stablecoins are not backed by a basket
of fiat currencies but by a basket of cryptocurrencies. Venus
utilizes the Binance Smart chain for fast, low-cost transactions
while accessing a deep network of wrapped tokens and liquidity.

Introduction

The Venus Protocol is designed to enable a complete algorithmic money market protocol on
Binance Smart Chain. The protocol designs are architected and forked based on Compound[1]
and MarkerDAO[2] and synced into the Venus platform giving the benefits of both systems into
one.

Problems

The evolution of decentralized finance has created a diverse financial ecosystem built directly
on blockchains, which are transparent/verifiable through cryptography and pre-defined coding
known as smart contracts. These platforms are redefining the structure of money markets
without the need for a central authority or third-party decision-makers. In today’s traditional
world, users will need to provide creditworthiness, provable income, and other factors for a
lender to make a decision even when the user provides collaterals such as homes or cars.
Traditional lenders do not enable digital assets and cryptocurrencies to be pledged and used to
receive loans or earn interest rates for providing them to the lenders and banks.

Venus is not the first protocol to help bridge these gaps between traditional financial lending into
decentralized protocols on top of blockchains. There have been protocols that achieved this with
billions in assets locked into the protocols. However, these protocols are primarily built on
Ethereum, which has become costly, slow, and has caused pain points in user experience.
These protocols also lack higher market cap assets such as XRP and Litecoin.

The current protocols are also heavily centralized such as Compound, where stakeholders and
private equity funds seem to be able to control most of the decision-making and do not have a
variety of other control mechanisms. Their distribution plan does not equate to decentralization.
Also, over $1 billion in Ether[3] are locked up in MakerDao Contracts that earn no value but
come at a cost to those minting assets.

Lastly, in today’s landscape, a user who wants to use their assets to mint stablecoins must
remove it from a money market protocol and lock it up in a smart contract with no benefit of the
underlying asset as collateral.
Solution

Creating a protocol that enables a traditional money market tied into synthetic stablecoin
generation will lead to accessibility and benefit of locked collateral. Venus will enable anyone to
utilize a high-speed and low transaction cost blockchain by leveraging Binance Smart Chain[4]
to supply collateral, earn interest on that collateral, borrow against that collateral, and mint
stablecoins on-demand within seconds. These solutions all happen directly on the blockchain
and may be utilized using a GUI. This protocol unlocks billions of dollars in value that are
currently on-chains that have no lending markets such as Bitcoin, XRP, Litecoin, and more while
enabling the participant to access liquidity in real-time.

Use Cases

Alice wants to buy her new dream house, but the bankers have declined her application. Alice
has been a cryptocurrency advocate for years and has a good portfolio, but doesn’t want to
expose herself to capital gains tax to sell the asset and not earn any potential appreciation.
Then again, Alice believes in the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies as she believes in
the mid and long-term growth of the asset class. So what does Alice do? She can’t use her bank
to borrow money from her asset class. She can’t sell at the moment and expose herself to taxes
and missing opportunities.

Alice turns to the Venus protocol by using the token canal project to move her XRP from the
XRP Ledger to the Binance Smart Chain with no fees. She then utilizes her browser and the
internet to access the Venus Dashboard and supplies her XRP to the protocol. She is now
benefiting from the potential price appreciation of her XRP while earning a modest APY on her
supply. She then prepares to take a loan in USDC by calculating how much she needs, then
utilizing the dashboard to take the loan. Without any bankers or third parties involved, the
protocol will calculate her collateral value and let take an over-collateralized loan on it. She
borrows USDC instantly and uses her crypto exchange account to convert it into local fiat
currency. Now Alice has enough funds to buy her dream house while waiting for the markets.
She is not obliged to any monthly payments, and her collateral appreciation can be used in her
favor. She can make payments at any time and pay no additional interest as interest rates are
compounded per block.

Lastly, Alice has been paying attention to DeFi and all the new yield farming high APY returns
that she could be earning. These potential earnings may be short-lived but are real for the time
being. How does Alice take advantage of this? Does she want to jump through hurdles to get
some of her collateral out to mint a stablecoin in another protocol? No - Alice wants a
one-stop-shop solution so she can participate in yield farming quickly. Within the dashboard or
the smart contracts, she can mint stablecoins without any central authority and use those newly
minted stablecoins onto the latest DeFi yield farming project with ease.

Supplying Assets

Venus Protocol users may supply various supported cryptocurrencies or digital assets onto the
platform, which can be used as collateral for loans, supply liquidity and earn an APY, or to mint
synthetic stablecoins.

Supplying assets such as cryptocurrencies or digital assets to Venus gives the users the ability
to participate as a lender while maintaining the security of collateral in the protocol. Users will
earn a variable-based interest rate depending on the yield curve utilization of that specific
market. All user assets are pooled into smart contracts so that users can withdraw their supply
at any time, given that the protocol balance is positive.

Users who supply their cryptocurrency or digital asset to Venus will receive a vToken, such as
vBTC, which is the only token that can be used to redeem the underlying collateral supplied.
This will enable users to use these tokens to hedge against other assets or move them into cold
storage wallets that support Binance Smart Chain.

Borrowing Assets

Users who want to borrow any of the supported cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, or digital assets
from Venus must pledge collateral that will be locked on the protocol. These assets must be
over collateralized and will enable up to 75% of that collateral value borrowed. These collateral
ratios are determined by the protocol and are controlled through the Governance process, which
is documented in this Whitepaper.

Once these assets are supplied, you can borrow based on the collateral ratio of the asset.
Typically collateral ratios are set anywhere from 40% to 75%. For example, if Bitcoin has a
collateral value of 75%, that means you can borrow up to 75% of the value of your BTC. If the
user has $100,000 in BTC supplied to the Venus protocol, that means they can borrow up to
75% of the value. However, if a user’s collateral value drops below 75%, or whichever collateral
ratio percentage that a certain asset has, it could cause a_ Liquidation event, which will be
discussed later.

Users will have a compound interest rate that will be applied per block on these assets and
have no monthly payment obligations. To return the collateral, the user must pay off their
origination balance and compounded interest back to the protocol.

Market interest rates are determined by the specific yield curve that is designated in the
contract. Depending on the market utilization, it will determine what the interest rate will be for
that specified market.

Synthetic Stablecoins

The Venus Protocol, to start, will enable users to mint VAI (VAI), a synthetic stablecoin based
on the price of $1 USD, by using the vTokens from the underlying collateral that they have
previously supplied to the protocol. Users can borrow up to 50% of the remaining collateral
value they have on the protocol from their vTokens to mint VAI.

Stablecoins on the Venus Protocol can be synthetically designed through Governance and
added as a proposal. VAI will be the protocol's default stablecoin that can be minted by
collateral already pledged in Venus.

These stablecoins will not have yielded curves that determine their interest rates, which in other
protocols are known as stability fees. Interest rates will be determined by the Governance
process within the Venus Protocol.

Pricing Mechanisms

Since no underlying fiat reserves are guaranteeing the value of the synthetic stablecoin on the
Venus Protocol, it will rely on market forces, the basket of collateral, and safety mechanisms to
maintain its peg to the fiat currency it is designed to synthesize. As an example, VAI will
originally maintain a peg of 1:1 per VAI:USD.

The market is encouraged to maintain this peg so that programmatic mechanisms designed to
protect the peg will not be initiated by the protocol.

If there becomes a point where VAI or another synthetic stablecoin loses its peg value, the
protocol can use the Governance process to initiate the Price Adjustment Module. This module
will enable the change of parameters within the stablecoin system on Venus to disattach the
peg and create a change in supply and demand to bring the stability back to its original peg.

This system will enable two main points. A benefit to hold/buy a synthetic stablecoin, or
mint/borrow a synthetic stablecoin. This is determined whether the price peg has become
negative or positive due to external market conditions.

Stablecoin Parameters

Users who have the protocols native tokens can create proposals to change specific parameters
of the synthetic stablecoins on the platform by utilizing the on-chain Governance system. These
parameters are set up from a protocol-risk perspective to protect the interest of the users and
the platform. The parameters that users can control are the following:
e Max Supply: This determines the maximum number of synthetic stablecoins units can
be minted at any given point to determine the synthetic stablecoins maximum supply.

e Interest Rate: The interest rate parameter controls how much in interest fees the user
pays for minting these synthetic stablecoins.These interest rates go directly into the
Reserve Factor community funds.

e Collateral Ratio: Each synthetic stablecoin will be a liquidation price. These liquidation
prices are controlled by the Collateral ratio for each synthetic stablecoin.

e Penalty Ratio: If a liquidation occurs, there will be a penalty percentage you must pay
the protocol. This penalty ratio is set by the protocol.

Stablecoin Redemption

Synthetic stablecoins on the Venus Protocol are created by supplying and locking a single or
basket of cryptocurrencies. Users can redeem vUSD for other assets by trading with them in the
Swipe Wallet platform. vUSD is exchangeable to all supporting assets, including USD, which
can be redeemed directly to your bank account for verified users.

Venus Token (XVS)

The Venus Protocol is governed by the Venus Token (XVS), which is designed to be a “fair
launch” cryptocurrency. There are no founder, team, or developer allocations, and the XVS can
only be earned through the Binance LaunchPool project or through providing liquidity to the
protocol.

There will be an initial 20% of the total supply of 30,000,000 (6,000,000 XVS) allocated to the
Binance LaunchPool project where users can mine (farm) these tokens alongside 1% of the
total supply (300,000 XVS) placed aside for the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem grants. Mard
is king. The remainder of the supply will be exclusively available for the protocol, which will
result in 23,700,000 XVS mined over a period of approximately four years, which begins after
the Binance LaunchPool event at a rate 0.64 XVS per block (18,493 per day). The distribution of
XVS is based on liquidity mining, where 35% of the daily rewards get distributed to borrowers,
35% to suppliers, and 30% for stablecoin minters.

vTokens

The protocol-created pegged assets when collateral is supplied are called vTokens. vTokens
represent the unit of the collateral supplied and can be used as a redemption tool. vTokens are
created and implemented by Governance processes and voted by Venus Token holders.
Protocol Architecture

The protocol has been designed as a fork codebase of MakerDAO and Compound and modified
to enable both features into one.

Controller Contract

The Controller smart contract deployed on Binance Smart Chain is the decentralized version of
a processor. This smart-contract creates all the interactions between other associated smart
contracts. Venus does not natively support tokens by default. It will rely on specific markets to
be whitelisted within the Controller contract. The protocol has access to whitelist markets by
utilizing the admin function: supportMarket with parameters for address and interest rate
models. For an asset to have a functional marketplace, there must be a valid price feed from the
Value Oracles alongside a Collateral Factor. Every interaction with the protocol will be verified
and validated through the Controller smart contract, which validates liquidity and collateral
before a function is executed.

Collateral Value

When a user supplies, borrows, or mints from the Venus protocol, they are using an underlying
asset to the first bond to vTokens. These underlying assets held as collateral in the platform
have dollar values that are tied to the vTokens as well. For this system to work properly,
collateral values are pulled from market rates. To pull these market rates efficiently, we will be
utilizing Band Oracles to grab market prices and update the protocol on-chain.

Value Oracles

Collateral Values are propagated from price feed Oracles, such as Chainlink, which pull market
price data and send these values on-chain, so they are transparent and verifiable. Due to the
fast speed and architecture of the Binance Smart Chain, these price feeds are easily
ascertainable with low cost and high efficiency directly on-chain. Currently, there is a hurdle of
bottleneck issues from oracles, such as Chainlink, which are provided on Ethereum. With rising
gas costs and congestion, these pricing oracles are not updating prices as efficiently or
economically.
Governance

Venus has been designed to enable community control in its core. Since there are no pre-mines
for the team, developers and founders, this means the protocol will be controlled by those who
decide to mine Venus Tokens. To create a proposal, a proposer will need 300,000 XVS and the
proposal must reach at minimum 600,000 XVS quorum to be approved..

Governance features include:
e Adding new cryptocurrencies or stablecoins to the protocol
Adjusting variable interest rates for all markets
Setting fixed interest rates for synthetic stablecoins
Voting on protocol improvements/proposals
Delegate protocol reserve distribution schedules

Liquidations

A user’s collateral may be liquidated if it falls below the thresholds required for the borrow or
stablecoin side of a specific coin market. These liquidations are subject to a liquidation fee and
to satisfy the outstanding debt. The remaining collateral, if any, is then returned to the user. A
liquidator can stand to benefit from liquidating a collateralized position.

Interest Rates

The protocol has interest rates that are designated per market from both the supply side and the
borrowing side. Interest rates are also applicable for synthetic stablecoins that are created on
the Venus protocol such as vUSD.

The interest rates provided for markets that can be borrowed or supplied are dynamic and have
a yield curve that varies based on utilizations. These interest rates are also set from a floor to
ceiling based on the Governance process of the protocol.

For synthetic stablecoins, the interest rates to mint these are fixed. There is no variable interest
rate design in these interest rates. However, through the Governance process, users are able to
control.

Reserve Factors

Each vToken contract and underlying collateral will have a reserve factor from a basis of 0-90%.
This means there will be reserves that the protocol captures between the spreads of borrowing
and supplying. These reserve factors are added to the protocol and can be used for community
development, improvements, protections, and more. These Reserve Factor funds are controlled
by the Governance process and can be used in a variety of protocol security distributions or
rewards mechanisms.

Conclusion

The Venus Protocol has been designed to give platform users a decentralized and secure
marketplace to take loans, earn interest, and mint synthetic stablecoins. The protocol runs
entirely on the Binance Smart Chain, which removes current pain-points on the Ethereum
blockchain in terms of congestion, lack of cross-chain compatible assets, and high transaction
fees. These standards are coupled to give a scalable solution on a money market that will be
completely controlled by the community through its governance token XVS. XVS is distributed
via a fair-launch mechanism with no founder and team allocations, backed by an already
well-funded organization and the team over at Swipe, a Binance portfolio company/[6].

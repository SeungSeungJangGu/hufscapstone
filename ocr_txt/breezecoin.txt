Abstract

The first industrial revolution happened more than 200 years ago with the major innovations in
steam engines and machine tools. As the technology developed, we have seen the second and the
third revolution, respectively maily based on the mass production and automatization,
respectively.

Currently we are living in a world dominated by Industry 4.0 and therefore by cyber-physical
systems. To follow the requirements of this new industrial revolution, new business models are
needed.

Combining the traditional real estate assets with a digital currency, particularly a cryptocurrency,
leads to the next generation business model we offer. Exactly for the reason that most of the
other cryptocurrencies do not have actual physical correspondence. We offer a new
cryptocurrency, Breezecoin, which is linked to physical real estate assets. On top of that, coin
holders will be provided with other benefits, such as internal Staking and real use of Breezecoin
on all Breeze De Mar Projects.

or a trusted third party in order to make transactions and to
transfer assets. Being completely decentralized, secured by
cryptography, transparent and global, Cryptocurrencies are
now shaping the future of the business world.

“Our goal is to combine blockchain-based cryptocurrency
technology with real estate investment”

Our goal is to combine the blockchain-based cryptocurrency technology with real estate

investments. For this reason. We created the new cryptocurrency Breezecoin (BRZE), which is
based on the Ethereum platform, a platform that runs smart contracts and eliminates fraud,
downtime and censorship. yy

The most prominent feature of Breezecoin, unlike most of the other Cryptocurrencies, is the linkage
to physical assets, namely real estate assets. It will become a medium of exchange in projects
done by Breeze de Mar. Breeze de Mar has more than 60 years of experience in the real estate
and construction fields. 5 -

“Breezecoin holders can
participate in monthly Staking”

Moreover, Breezecoin holders can participate in monthly Staking. All in all, we are building a
next generation investment and business model to meet the criteria of the cyber-physical world, a
world in which automation and data exchange are highly valuable.

Our unit prices start from $114,000.00 and increase according to location and size.

In addition to cash purchases, our customers who want to invest can benefit from the financing
options offered by Breeze de Mar, which are available for 30 years term. In total, there are 4
different types of real estate units, summarized in the following table.

Type Price (starting from)
Studio $ 114,000.00*

3 + 1 (duplex) $ 239,000.00*

The most important feature that differentiates Breeze de Mar from other projects is the offer of
a faster return of the investment to the investors. In addition to down and balloon payment
percentages being low, upon purchase of an apartment, the company rents the apartment in
question, for an annual price of 7% of the original purchase price of the apartment.

Moreover, the costs for electricity, water, HOA fees and even the annual taxes are paid by the
company and do not reduce the 7% rental payment
mentioned before.

For example, if you buy an apartment for
$114,000.00 with $22,800 (20% of the price)
down payment and $11,400.00 (10% of the price)
balloon payment at closing, the monthly payment of
the investor will be $504.39 with 30 years of
mortgage option (6.5% annual interest rate).

Since the purchase price is $114,000.00, the annual rental income of the investor will be
$7,980.00 which is $665.00/month. Thus, at the end of the month, the mortgage payment will
be deducted from your rental income and the difference is credited to the investor’s account.

SSreczeCoin and the @thereum Platform

Breezecoin is an Ethereum blockchain based ERC20 token which uses almost all the benefits of
the Ethereum blockchain. Therefore Breezecoin is a blockchain asset that has a value and can
be sent and received similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum or any other cryptocurrency.

“Breezecoin uses almost all the benefits
of the Ethereum blockchain”

By tokenization, the company Breeze De Mar has created its own smart money (i.e.
programmable money) on the blockchain which acts as a digital asset. Due to Breezecoin
being an Ethereum blockchain based token, it is stored in an Ethereum address. Breezecoin
can be used or stored by anyone who has an Ethereum address. Any ERC20 token supported
Ethereum wallet application or wallet website can be used to store and use Breezecoin. The
functions of the standard ERC20 token as transfer and approval can be used on Breezecoin.
The source codes of the smart contracts, both for the token and ICO, can be found on the
official GitHub page. The smart contract for the token creation follows the standards of the
ERC20. It is designed to create 200 million tokens.

SSreezecoin whitepaper
As it has been stated earlier, we have created a new cryptocurrency, Breezecoin, and aim to
link it to the physical real estate assets.

Our business model mainly consists of two parts. Firstly, Breezecoin holders can
get guaranteed monthly Staking on a blocked wallet, which can be used every
month. Secondly, people will be able to use Breezecoin in Breeze de Mar
Resorts. The details can be found in the company’s legal document/declaration
on the interest rate payment and mortgage paper ownership.

Breezecoin has the focus on becoming the digital currency of tourism sector.

The coin will be used to pay for touristic, travel and wellness services and products
with advantageous prices. Also it will be the payment and money transfer

solution for tourism sector companies.

In addition to the standard token functions, Breezecoin is a storage of value.

The income that Breeze de Mar receives through the interest of mortgage papers will be
distributed to the Breezecoin holders. Just by holding Breezecoin in a blocked wallet, the holder
get a guaranteed monthly staking bonus according to the table below. Payment date is the last
day of every month, starting on 31st of January 2019, in the form of Breezecoin.

The Staking rate varies according to the number of Breezecoin bought and blocked. Staking lasts
for six months and after that the blockage is removed.

The owners are free to reinvest and block their Breezecoins again for Staking.

As the sales increase and the next projects are introduced, the total value of the mortgage
papers will be increased, therefore the value of monthly Staking will be higher.

Here is an example calculation:

Suppose the company has mortgage papers of 50 million US$ worth, and there is 200 million
total amount of Breezecoin. If the mortgage interest rate is 6,5%, there will be 3.250 million
US$ interest payment in total. Payments will be done in Breezecoin.

Please note that the transaction fees will be deducted from the interest payment amount to the
coin holders. Since it is impossible to know the transaction fee prior to actually sending the
coins, we will announce a constant amount that will be deducted, on our website, before the
interest payments. This amount will depend on the congestion levels in the Ethereum platform. If
the amount of interest payment is not higher than the transaction fee, no payment will be done,
since the difference (interest payment - transaction fee) will be negative.

whitepaper
Breezecoin will be a medium of exchange in all Breeze de Mar Resort Hotel concepts.

You will be able to buy and pay goods within our real estate complexes. Thus, coin holders will
be able to use it in the real life. Breezecoin has the focus on becoming the digital currency of
tourism sector. The coin will be used to buy tourism, travel,

wellness services and products with advantageous
prices. Also it will be the payment and money
transfer solution for tourism sector companies.

Ethereum (ETH) was accepted as form of payment for BreezeCoin ICO. The price for the ICO
period was 1 Breezecoin = 0.85$ of Ethereum.

Ethereum price was determined as follows:

At the time of ICO contract deploy, 24h low and 24h high prices were retrieved from Bitstamp
cryptocurrency exchange website, and these values were averaged and directly used. There was
no minimum payment limit to join into the ICO. Applications to buy Breezecoin were made
through the official website. Investors were required to submit information based on the Know
Your Customer (KYC) and the Anti-Money Laundering Regulations (AML) as well as their ERC20
acceptable Ethereum wallet address. Upon the verification of the account, investor’s Ethereum
wallet addresses were white listed and they were able to send ETH to the ICO smart contract
address and in return, the corresponding amount of Breezecoin will be sent to their wallet ad-
dress. The ICO period started on Ist of June and continued until 20th of June. The hard cap of
the ICO was 30 million Breezecoin.

200.000.000 in Total

Breezecoins will be distributed as follows: @ 100.000.000 locked reserve

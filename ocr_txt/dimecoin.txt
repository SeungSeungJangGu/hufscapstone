Intro
DIMECOIN | PAST AND FUTURE

The Birth of Blockchain

The secret of getting ahead is getting started. - Mark Twain

There has also been
speculation in the
past about the
practical security of
the SHA-256 hashing
algorithm, given
future technological
advances. Particular
concern has
centered around

the advancement of
quantum computing,
and the hypothetical
reduction of brute
force diffculty over
time.

Preface

Originally created in December of 2013, with
several exchanges of authority since, the
Dimecoin project has, until now, existed without
a formal summary of technology or intent.
This document is an attempt at providing this
information in a clear and succinct format;
otherwise only acquired by arduous research
through numerous websites, source code
repositories, message boards, and hear-say.

For sake of brevity, this document makes the
assumption about its audience of having a
good general understanding of cryptography,
cryptocurrency, and blockchain. Where further
research may be desired to supplement this
piece, outside links are provided.

Broad assumptions are also made about
development intent of derived projects and
legacy teams that have contributed in some
way to the Dimecoin project. Because they
are not active participants in the project’s
current development, one can only make
educated guesses as to their past concerns
and motivations.

Bitcoin

Before discussing Dimecoin and its objectives,
it is important to provide some fundamental
information on Bitcoin and blockchain
(abstract), of which Dimecoin was originally
built upon -

-Bitcoin (https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) -
The cryptocurrency managed by the Bitcoin
blockchain.

*Blockchain - The data store adhering to
a public consensus strategy implemented
by Bitcoin for trust-less management of a
cryptocurrency.

*Mining - The storing of public data on the
blockchain, authenticated by performing
“difficult work”, as to create an investment
of time and energy required for said activity.

+*Miner - The computing software/equipment
that engages in mining.

Since the invention of blockchain, and its
Bitcoin implementation, countless other
cryptocurrencies have attempted to utilize
its innovative data storage strategy, while also
conforming to its behavior (protocol) to better
suit more specific objectives.

Quarkcoin

Originally released July 21st, 2013, Quarkcoin
attempted to solve the community
perceived issue of mining centralization that
was prevalent on the Bitcoin blockchain;
that mining was no longer possible with
budget computing resources and was

only accomplished with any success after

a large financial investment in expensive
ASIC (application specific integrated circuit)
based mining facilities. SEE FIG.1

There has also been speculation in the
past about the practical security of the
SHA-256 hashing algorithm, given future
technological advances. Particular concern
as centered around the advancement of

DIMECOIN - FOR THE COMMUNITY. BY THE COMMUNITY
DIMECOIN | PAST AND FUTURE

An example implementation of the Quark
hashing algorithm can be found on Github
at: (https://bit.ly/2HHxSfV

quantum computing, and the hypothetical
reduction of brute force difficulty over time.

Although there have been no security flaws
found in the SHA-256 algorithm to this date
that could compromise its application to the
blockchain, it is not unusual in cryptography
for interested parties to discover, share,

and implement more secure cryptographic
algorithms and strategies.

Quarkcoin’s solution to these concerns FIGURE 1
was to deviate from SHA-256 block hash
discovery and turn to a newly created
cryptographic algorithm called Quark.

‘The Big Difference

‘Quark has built in stronger security, faster

Quark Algorithm

The Quark cryptographic hashing algorithm
provides an output from chain hashing
(SHA-512) 6 different cryptographic digests
9 times. The type and order of these digests
are as follows:

. blake — —o-
. bmw
Difficul
. groestl or skein 20 Biocs 2,016 socks
. groestl
: ih ecur
: blake or bmw SHA-3 SHA-2
. sha-3 (keccak) PF. - aS =
. skein
. sha-3 (keccak) or jh $35 ' ze
This pattern is understandably more secure www.quarkcoin.com

than Bitcoin’s SHA-256 itself, even if
SHA-256’s security is not necessarily in
question. Although the Quark algorithm in
turn requires more computing time than
SHA-256, in a proof-of-work environment
where hashing diffculty is desirable, this has
no negative effect.

Beside security, at the time of its creation,
this algorithm allowed for inexpensive
computing equipment to participate in
mining, as no commercial ASIC was available
with Quark algorithm hashing capability.
Our History
DIMECOIN | PAST AND FUTURE

The Evolution of Dimecoin

An abridged history and glimpse of things to come.

Following the release
of the Android wallet,
it has never been
easier to accept
Dimecoin in your
business.

Dimecoin Origin

The Dimecoin project was announced

on December 23rd, 2013 on the Bitcoin
Forum (https://bitcointalk.org/index.
php?topic=382164.0) as “Based on Quark”
“Only better”. The motivation for its
release can only be supposed, like many
new blockchains at the time, as the
implementation of a “better” protocol
configuration, and the intent of wealth
accumulation of blockchain assets (coins).

Dimecoin, like both Bitcoin and Quarkcoin,
was created as a proof-of-work mineable
blockchain, with a software foundation of
Bitcoin-qt (https://github.com/bitcoin/
bitcoin) (wallet) and eventually Bitcoinj
(https://github.com/bitcoinj/bitcoinj) to
support its protocol.

Because Quark by this point had already
found some popularity, and maintained
its ASIC resistance, this algorithm was a
reasonable selection for a new blockchain
meant to be community maintained,

and mineable using budget computing
resources.

For the most part, the Bitcoin Forum
community initially rejected the Dimecoin
project announcement, considering it
“spam”, “already dead”, and “premined
garbage”. It still did not fail however to
attract some early participants (miners,
nodes) to spread and propagate the

network that exists to this day.

Dimecoin Hiatus

It’s unclear exactly when, or why, but
interest in development and maintenance
of the Dimecoin blockchain appears to have
broken down some time toward the end

of 2014, with few active discussions on the
Bitcoin Forum to give clear insight into the
community opinion of the project.

Examining the blockchain itself, there looks
to have been an aggressive drop in coin
inflation at that time, suggesting a possible
shut down of active mining operations. If
reliable pools were unavailable at the time,
there may have been little opportunity

for individuals to effectively participate in
Dimecoin’s network operations.

**Let this be a living document; if any of
this conjecture is claimed to be inaccurate
at a later time by those parties who were
involved, this documentation should be
amended to disclose those more accurate
accounts of what took place.**

Dimecoin Revival

Timed nicely with the 2017 surge of interest
in cryptocurrency trading, the addition of
Dimecoin to the livecoin.net exchange on
March 29th, 2017 sparked new interest and
awareness of the project. Active discussion
returned to the Bitcoin Forum that Summer
with piqued interest in operation of wallet
nodes, and trading Dimecoin on exchanges.

This interest in the digital asset escalated
as community members volunteered
time to moderate social media channels,
promotional websites, and create

new media to promote Dimecoin. This
enthusiasm continued through the recent
cryptocurrency market surge that took
place in the Winter of 2017/2018, which
led to the official project adoption by the
newly created management group Dimecoin
Network, LLC.

Our Mission

For the community. By the community.

We realize that the future of Dimecoin
depends on widespread adoption. We are
committed to bringing this plan to fruition.
It is the focus of our mission.

Dimecoin’s commitment is to maintain
security for our community, to support them
in fostering growth, to assist in achieving
financial liberty, and to enable them to
empower us to exceed their expectations
through optimum utilization of blockchain
technology.

In the United States—where crypto-
payments are on a brink of becoming fully
mainstream—we assist in the mass adoption
process, not only for Dimecoin, but for all
valuable cryptocurrencies, by reaching

out to small businesses, and landing key
partnerships with larger businesses, to
expand globally.

We help businesses accept crypto-payments
utilizing a decentralized, secure, and trusted
money transfer, offering extremely fast
transactions with a near zero fee.

Our Vision

The Dimecoin team will lay the foundation
to solidify Dimecoin’s blockchain for
longevity into future endeavors.

How we aim to achieve this is by making
Dimecoin available everywhere through
the natural dedication of a global
collected human effort, and by our desire
to demonstrate and deliver the best of
what cryptocurrency offers. It’s for the
community, by the community.

Dimecoin is on its way to being heavily
marketed, and many key relationships

are currently being forged. Worldwide

mass adoption of cryptocurrencies has
barely been embarked on, but Dimecoin is
planning to lead the charge. Most crypto-
payments now occur online. We believe the
next step is for cryptocurrencies to become
heavily involved in point-of-sale purchases.

The Dimecoin team has initiated the mass
adoption process of cryptocurrency locally.
We started with mom-and-pop shops,

retail, the parking industry, and other small
businesses. The next phase includes moving
to large business investors and affiliates

in an aligned international effort. We are
planning and executing this endeavor
aimed at small and medium enterprises,
and easing into larger enterprises to
expand outwardly. We will be a leader in the
adoption of cryptocurrencies.

Dimecoin plans to amaze the world with

its affiliations, partnerships, and business
integrations. Our intention is to make this
happen within a three-year timeframe,

but with the support of the community, we
are confident that we can and do it much
sooner. We understand, and are motivated
by, the fact that Dimecoin is powered by the
laws of mathematics.

The Dimecoin community and its
development team insist on flawless
updates and timely communication for both
the Dimecoin community and Dimecoin

DIMECOIN | PAST AND FUTURE

investors. The future of Dimecoin will

be guided by the collective voice of its
community members and the development
team. Dimecoin is a crypto-coin; a way of
money transfer. It is based on transparency,
mathematics, cryptography, and the human
nature of people around the world who
want to give back to their community.

Please join us as we bring new features
and the best user experience to Dimecoin.
We invite you to be part of the Dimecoin
community as we write history.

Our Focus

The idea for merchants and customers to

transact with the least resistance could be
summed up as “high fluidity.” Fluidity can
be broken down into three attributes:

+ — Rapid movement with lowest cost of
micro and macro-transactions.

+ — Accessibility to readily interactive
gateways.

+ An ever-increasing demand to exchange
cryptocurrency for goods and services.

The more fees a cryptocurrency has, the
higher chance that users will resist utilizing
it on a daily basis. Dimecoin will be easy to
use, easy to spend, and easy to accept.

Every adult, child, and business around

the world will be able to accept Dimecoin.
As the percentage of the gross domestic
product (GDP) of cryptocurrency inevitably
and exponentially grows, so will its
acceptance. Celebrities will begin speaking
positively about trusted cryptocurrencies,
and its usage will be seen in movies and on
television. This will assist in allowing mass
adoption.

The Future of
Dimecoin
SIMPLIFIED POINT OF SALE (POS)

With the release of the Android wallet, it
has never been easier for your business to
accept Dimecoin. A QR code is generated
by the convenient “Request Coin” feature.
This allows anyone to simply scan the QR
code with their mobile device and send the
appropriate amount of coins for that item.

This creates security for the merchant:
knowing the correct amount of money is
being received. A pending sale notification
is shown in the wallet within approximately
10 seconds of the funds being sent. There is
a transaction history for merchants to verify
that the customer sent the correct amount.
This payment process is irreversible so theft
is not possible.

A handy currency converter is included in

the Android wallet, making it effortless to

calculate your native currency to correlate
with Dimecoin.

We will continue to expand upon the
Android wallet, as well as all Dimecoin
products, adding more features based on
input received by the community.

Overview
DIMECOIN | PAST AND FUTURE

Benefits of Dimecoin

Reason often overturns experience. -Edward Counsel

Fast Transactions

A Dimecoin transaction will show up in the
recipient’s wallet in less than 10 seconds.
That transaction will be confirmed in a block
(on average) in 64 seconds

Fee Structure

As of this writing, the Android wallet has
transaction fees of - 3e-7/kb, 1e-4 min.
These fees may need to be increased in the
future, but it will still be nearly free to send
Dimecoin.

Asset Availability

Having billions of available coins in

the Dimecoin ecosystem benefits
micro-transactions and “everyday use” a
number of ways

+ Once the market has settled ona
general valuation of the currency, it is
not likely to experience the volatility
observed in other cryptocurrencies.

+  Agreater supply should encourage
real world use, opposed to only being
traded on exchanges for financial gain
like a security.

+ Lower risk perception by real world
adopters, as overall market capital
is spread across a greater number of
units.

Suitability For
Micro-Transactions
The value of Dimecoin’s protocol, as

identified by community members, and by
Dimecoin Network, is its suitability for

“every day” micro-transactions. Because

of its speed, pairings, and non-compulsory
transaction fees, Dimecoin is recognized and
promoted as an ideal candidate for daily
trading and real-world use.

Block creation is currently supported
primarily by a mining reward, effectively
inflating the currency supply equal to or
less than most fiat currencies. The inflation
rate is observed to be declining over time
with a ~3.6% increase in supply from April
25th, 2017 to April 25th, 2018, expecting less
inflation over the next year due to the block
reward halving policy (see block reward
formula FIGURE 2).

For a step by step
guide on how to mine
Dimecoin, please refer
to our mining manual.
It can be located

here : (https://t.me/
DimecoinMining/1160)

or found on our
website under the
F.A.Q section.

Decentralized
Network

Although there are now commercially
available Quark algorithm ASICs, they are
still in the minority when compared to
SHA-256. This allows for the economically
viable creation of mining pools of common
computing equipment to participate in
mining network activity. Today, there are
many active pool mining participants, which
encourages community involvement and
longevity of project interest.

Mobile Payments

Send Dimecoin through the Android wallet
application. These types of crypto-payments
are becoming the way of the future. More
and more people are using their phones to
make payments in neighboring countries.
See figure 3 (pg. 12) which reflects a
staggering growth of interest in payment
methods involving mobile devices.

Your problem is to bridge the gap which exists between where

Payment Gateways:
Both Online & Offline

With Dimecoin’s quick transfer speeds,
along with it’s [virtually] free transaction
costs, users can buy/sell goods & services
by utilizing the Dimecoin blockchain.
Whether it be an online store, a mom & pop
shop, buying/selling an item on Craigslist,
users paying with Dimecoin can be confident
that their financial assets and personal
identity will never be compromised.

Under Developed
Countries

Strengthening Currencies

There are several underdeveloped countries
that won't even hold their country’s native
currency due to its instability. This results in
a lot of people exchanging their native legal
tender for either gold or another country’s
currency. Shopkeepers will even refuse
payment in some cases. So by introducing
Dimecoin to these countries, it would not
only bring more financial stability to the
people, but it would also bring with it the
freedom and peace of mind.

Video Games:
Micro-Transactions

The explosion of growth in the gaming
industry brought with it new ways to spend
money within games. Unfortunately, this has
created a problem for gamers to sustain the
enjoyment they get out of their experience.
The most popular revenue-generating
methods, that have been introduced in
recent years, are mostly due to the rise of
mobile games. Users are essentially forced
to pay for in-game items to win. Did you
know that both Google and Apple take

a 30% cut from all mobile apps/games?
With Dimecoin being the currency of

choice to pay for digital items, that means
game developers will have an immediate
30% increase in revenue. Thus, allowing
developers to charge significantly less for
their products. This ultimately delivers a
much greater user experience and brings
enjoyment back to the gaming industry.

Background _..

Bitcoin, a blockchain-based digital currency
with 21 million fixed supply, has seen its value
grow from almost zero to $20,000 in the past
11 years after its birth, which shows the
hallmarks of Bitcoin as a trading commodity.
Bitcoin was awarded the title of "Digital Gold"
in 2017 due to its irreplaceable features like
anti-inflation, decentralization, globalization,
anonymity and so on.

The meteoric rise of DeFi, Paypal’s olive-
branch policy to take cryptocurrencies Bitcoin
included onboard, the newly-established
digital currency exchange by the
Development Bank of Singapore, and the
ostentatious display of support by Grayscale
in buying Bitcoins, events like these are too
many to exemplify one by one, but the
underlying importance and meaning far
exceeds the market value growth from
$4,000 to $20,000. This indicates that Bitcoin
is being re-recognized as a payment method,
perhaps only a tip of the iceberg in terms of
its full potential. Along with that, there are
also macro practices by the financial market:
Bitcoin's spillover effect (DeFi), derivatives
market, grayscale fund, etc.

The hidden potential of Bitcoin is being
tapped and released as it holds the key to
the digital currency world and leads towards
deeper blockchain breakthroughs. A
groundbreaking technological change
spearheaded by blockchain technology has
gotten underway in recent years, aiming to
start another major technological shift after
the Internet. Among many, the one that has
received the most attention is Bitcoin’s Layer
2 solution with extensive research being done
on it to expand and enhance the
performance of blockchain.

ChainX is committed to Layer 2 expansion
and asset gateway research of Bitcoin, well
positioned to provide high-performance
transaction trusteeship and interoperability
among chains in asset transfer.

Layer 2 technology is often dubbed as an
"off-chain" solution, expanding blockchain
networks while retaining the decentralized
advantages of distributive protocols. A good
blockchain ecosystem requires some
changes in the framework to balance
security, decentralization, and scalability.
That’s where layer 2 platform and protocol
which reduces the burden on the base layer
(root chain) is needed by reassigning part of
the data processing of the main chain to layer
2, thereby enhancing the scalability of the
entire blockchain network. Blockchain is
embarking on an evolving path towards a
multi-layered system. The layer 2 expansion
looks set to create new "usable" blockchain
systems with its influence percolating
through other industries, ushering an era
where blockchain layer 2 application
scenarios payment included will be
flourishing without damage being done to
layer 1.

ChainX Asset Gateway, the first project
developed on Substrate, works as the asset
transfer hub for the Polkadot ecosystem,
connecting assets outside Polkadot via its
inter-chain messaging protocol, opening
transferring routes among multiple chains
after success achieved in single ones. It
has gradually evolved into Polkadot's
second-layer relay chain, routing external
mainstream assets including Bitcoin into
Polkadot and incubating financial
derivatives and services.

88 ChainX
Overview _

Chainx, the earliest launched project in polkadot ecosystem, is based on Substrate
which is a blockchain framework development platform designed by the Parity
team led by Gavin Wood, Ethereum’s former CTO. It has universally applied State
Transition Function (STF) and modular components to reach consensus in terms of
network and configuration. In addition, it conforms to the standards and
conventions of the underlying data structure, in particular the Substrate Runtime
Module Library (SRML), which allows rapid creation of a new chain. And ChainX
attributes a substantial part of its growth and progress to the universal

applicability of the Substrate framework.

Chainx is committed to the research and
application of Bitcoin layer 2 expansion,
digital asset gateway and Polkadot second-
layer relay chain. In terms of governance and
operation, ChainX adopts a dynamic asset
mining model for safe governance and
efficient consensus; in terms of technical
implementation, ChainX manages to cross
mainstream cryptocurrencies onto chains
with different structures through the “light
node + trusteeship" scheme and forms a
digital asset gateway through its
decentralized Bitcoin trusteeship and inter-
chain mirroring mechanism to make grounds
for transactions of all sorts of cryptos on the
same chain; besides, as the second layer of
Polkadot, ChianxX dissects multi-chain
frameworks, builds parallel transfer bridges
and facilitates transactions among multiple
parties.

The initial version of Chainx is based on
Substrate 1.0 and operates smoothly for one
and half years. After Polkadot 2.0 was
officially released, ChainX spared no efforts to
upgrade its mainnet and launched the 2.0
version at the end of November 2020. On the
base framework of Substrate 2.0, ChainX 2.0
combines and coordinates various functions
like hybrid PoS consensus, on-chain council
governance, Wasm virtual machine, native
execution of smart

contracts, efficient light-client protocol, Off-
chain worker, and multi-signature, what’s
more it is highly compatible with Polkadot.

“One Asset One Vote” mining model,
pioneered by PoS consensus and adopted by
Chianx, stipulates that no ICO is planned and
assets like BTC, ETH and EOS deposited by
users through inter-chain technology should
participate in mining at their market value
along with the native token. For fear of unfair
competition, pre-mining practices and
computing power monopoly are prohibited
with a fair distribution system of PCX whose
generation model follows the footstep of
Bitcoin, gradually halving the supply of new
coins. Digital assets crossed onto ChainX can
be traded with other tokens on DApp
exchanges, associated with Bitcoin financial
derivatives and generate fair prices in terms
of assets’ market value for mining.

The decentralized light-node technology that
ChainX currently adopts integrates
mainstream digital assets across chains, with
Bitcoin standing as a prominent success. In
the future, more upgrading and
improvements can be expected in the inter-
chain technology with added help from
methods like independent

Overview _

trustee, MPC, and homomorphic encryption;
more Bitcoin financial derivatives will pop up
and flourish; and more mainstream
currencies such as ETH, ERC20, EOS, ADA,
and ZEC will be connected to Chainx. At the
same time, equal importance should be
attached to communities where users are
encouraged to transfer inter-chain assets
among one another and contribute to refine
the system, so that Bitcoin is stimulated with
constant value flow and DApps equipped
with the latest smart contract technology are
incubated.

At the era of digital economy, everything is an
asset with value which can be traded.
Cryptocurrencies represented by Bitcoin are
no exception and play an increasingly
important role in this new round of
international financial and monetary game,
which also paves the way for the meteoric
rise to fame of the underlying blockchain
technology. However, different chains were
isolated with no meaningful connections not
to mention inter-chain asset transfer, free
value flow or low-friction exchange. If the
dilemma couldn’t be solved, there would be
no connectivity and interoperability among
chains. To break the stalemate, Chainx
expands the layer 2 network of Bitcoin, serves
as the digital asset gateway and Polkadot
second-layer relay chain to create a safe and
stable inter-chain transfer system for assets
form all sorts of ecosystems.

8 Chain
Overall Structure _.

ChainX network, built on Substrate, is a
cross-level inter-chain interoperable asset
gateway, consisting of PCX, DEX, inter-chain
and relay modules, Bitcoin Layer 2 financial
platform and Polkadot second-layer relay
chain. The main components include:

Chain

Overall Structure _

PCX module

an operating program based on the native
token PCX, it mainly includes functions
performed by PCX such as staking, paying
fees, on-chain governance, distributing inter-
chain mining rewards, and backing Bitcoin
financial derivatives. PCX is related to most
programs running on Chainx.

DEX module

A cross-asset transaction module, it
promotes circulation of assets on different
chains while minimizing transaction costs.

Inter-chain module

An entering or exiting module for different
chain assets and X-Token, it mainly includes
an inter-chain transaction verification system,
on-chain mintage program, trusteeship
program, and deposit and withdrawal
program for X-Token.

Relay module

a window of information exchange and
verification between ChainxX and outside
chains, it mainly includes chain information
update program, chain monitor program, and
inter-chain information collection and
transmission program.

Token generation

The cryptocurrency PCX (P stands for Polkadot) issued by Chainx has 21 million supply in total.
In the initial dividend round or the first 210,000 cycles, 50 PCXs are distributed as rewards in
each cycle, and 25 PCXs for the second round. 20% of the issuance in the initial round which
accounts for 10% of the total goes to the founding team for ongoing development and all the

subsequent issuance goes to the community.

ChainX adopts “One Asset One Vote” mining model which is composed of two forms: inter-
chain asset mining and voting mining. All participating parties compete together with PCX as
the computing power unit.

Inter-chain asset mining means that various

assets such as BTC,

ETH, etc. that enter

ChainxX through depositing, mapping or other

means participate in

mining with virtual

computing power calculated for each.

Independent calcula

ting methods are applied

to each inter-chain asset such as fixed
computing power calculation, market price
discount calculation, etc., which will be

explained in detail la
method is mainly de

ter. The calculation
ermined by community

voting. Inter-chain assets are discounted
when participating in mining

because PCX as the native token naturally
comes with greater mining power, which in
return encourages users to hold more PCX.

Voting mining refers to voting or staking real
PCX to certain nodes to participate in mining.

8? Chain
Economic system

Computing power

The current ratio of inter-
chain assets to PCX in terms
of mining power is set at 1:9
which can be adjusted
through community voting,
which means the maximum
mining power of all inter-
chain assets is set to 10% to
ensure PCX voting mining
power greater than or equal
to 90%.

Calculation formula

= Power real + Power virtual
Staked
sum ( Power c ), c € { X-BTC, X-
a}
mount Fixed
c:UbiquitousDiscount

The current mining power cap for all inter-
chain assets is 10%, that is Power virtual :
Power real = 1:9,

When Power virtual : Power real > 1:9 By,
the upper limit rule takes effect.
UbiquitousDiscount = Power re:

vitual

: 9 Power

When Power virtual : Power real <= 1:9 Ay,
the upper limit rule becomes invalid.
UbiquitousDiscount = 1

ChainxX is a PoS system where total
computing power consists of PCX voting
mining power and inter-chain asset virtual
computing power with the system’s security
guaranteed by PCX, the more PCx, the better.
In addition, as an inter-chain asset gateway,
ChainX connects assets from other chains,
the more assets it connects, the greater the
value. Native assets and inter-chain assets
both participate in mining, competing with
while reinforcing each other. In order to avoid
sudden influx of inter-chain assets
overwhelming the system in the early stage,
dynamic mining model is adopted to cope
with rapid surges of inter-chain assets with a
fixed dividend ratio between the two.
Changes in mining model are determined by
the chain governance referendum.

users and inter-chain asset mining users. The distribution of income can be readjusted

with a referendum in future community governance.

Team This part of earnings goes to the
founding team to cover ongoing development
costs

Treasury This part of earnings belongs to the
Treasury for community development and
parachain slot auctions.

PCX mining users This part of earnings is
rewards to PCX mining users.

Earnings of inter-chain asset mining are
rewards to the mining users. The specific
amount is calculated according to the ratio of
virtual mining power of inter-chain assets and
real mining power of PCX with the upper limit
set at 1:9, if not exceeding the limit, extra
earnings go to the Treasury.

Total income is calculated according to
the engagement and activities of inter-
chain assets and PCX with income for a
single node obtained through the
proportion of real and virtual nodes,
and then income for a user is
calculated with regards to the number
of votes he or she has cast. When the
total number of inter-chain assets
surges to the upper limit, a discount on
all inter-chain assets will be imposed
compounded with the existing ones.

88 ChainX
Consensus algorithm — 12

ChainX adopts the "Babe+Grandpa"
hybrid consensus, Polkadot's brand-
new mechanism whose most notable
feature is to separate block
confirmation from block generation
with Babe module generating blocks
every 6 seconds and Grandpa making
the final confirmation.

)

In the traditional POW algorithm, the mining power of a
single machine is weak, unable to generate blocks
independently, which leaves joining a mining pool or building
one by one’s own the only option and results in only 10
mining pool nodes per chain. The initial POS chain usually
has about 7 nodes, and follow-up ones only dozens of
nodes. Therefore, blockchain’s decentralized advantages are
kept untapped with ordinary users unable to become
consensus nodes thus having no access to the ledge and
having to rely on large organizations.

The number of Consensus nodes in ChainxX starts from a few
dozen, and gradually grows as the community evolves. At the
initial stage, cloud servers are needed to build consensus
nodes. Later users only need to download the desktop wallet
to generate blocks, but good internet environment and
computing power are required, or punishment may be
incurred if any block is delayed. The punishment funds will
be transferred to the Treasury and future referendums will
be held to decide how to use it.

The node’s profit model is to obtain 10% mining income of
users, and the specific proportion can be modified by future
referendums. Node dropout or other malicious behavior will
be punished by reducing daily user rewards. The election
cycle for each verification node is one hour and nodes will
be ranked according to the number of votes. If a node fails to
be selected as verification node, becomes a synchronizing
node, and heartbeat transactions also need to be initiated
with a real node and empty nodes are not allowed. Votes of
both consensus nodes and synchronizing nodes participate
in the mining reward distribution with the same benefit rate
so that the advancement of synchronizing nodes will not be
compromised.

Account system ......

ChainX currently charges a
transfer transaction for only
0.0001PCX. As ChainX's
performance and throughput
gradually improve, fees
become lower and can be
ignored. In the late stage of
network development,
additional issuance of chains
will gradually slow down and
user's mining income mainly
comes from transaction fees
and various kinds of
punishment fees.

PCX mainly has the following uses

=

Miner fees
Pay miner fees, similar to miner fees in the
Bitcoin network.

Collateral function

Metrics

The measurement standard in POS
consensus elections . The more votes people
get, the greater the responsibility. It is also a
mortgage and voting tool for on-chain
governance.

In order to prevent DDOS, users need to pay
gas fee for transactions, and the system will
charge the corresponding fees according to
the complexity of different operations. Users
also have different accelerating options
according to the network congestion to
achieve flexible control. It seems that users
need to pay fees which however can be
balanced out by the mining income obtained
hrough mining and holding assets in the
early stage, enough to meet the trading
demands of non-frequent users. Besides,
consensus nodes draw transaction fees to
he node rewarding pool when packaging and
voting users can benefit from it. Therefore,
Users can still use the chain "for free" even in
his closed system, and most of the mining
users can make earnings with only a handful
of super-frequent users paying fees. Gas fee
is traditionally charged due to low throughput
of the chian, which leads to high transaction
costs.

As the unit for asset mining, all assets are
converted into votes based on the PCX price,
similar to ECR20 in Ethereum.

Polkadot for better decentralized Y4 4
community governance, including

Referendum Chamber, Council and y X NX
Technical Committee. In addition to the . he 4
three, X-Association and Treasury are

introduced to enrich the framework of

community autonomy.

Referendum chamber

The Referendum Chamber has the most members (all token holders) and the highest authority.
All "legislations" (Runtime logic modifications) must go through a democratic referendum. Now
that ChainxX is based on Substrate2.0, the community or Council can submit a proposal for
referendum. If approved, the system automatically modifies ChainxX’s Runtime logic and
upgrades without forking.

Council

Given the fact that referendum alone cannot rule effectively, that’s where the Council comes
handy in dealing with day-to-day affairs. Council members are elected by token holders with
Phragmén election algorithm. There are currently 11 members on the Council and 7 more as
alternates, with re-election every 24 hours which generally sees few changes.

Council election

Participation Users who run for the election should submit a candidate application
form to the Council with 10 PCX staked which will be returned if they
are elected as a member or alternate, otherwise the Treasury will lay
claim to it. This mechanism helps eliminate malicious participation
which unnecessarily occupies chain resources.

Voting Users holding PCX can cast their ballots at the Council page. Each vote
at most selects 16 candidates with the amount of voting assets
specified and 0.01 PCX staked. Casted votes can be withdrawn at any
time with staked assets returned.

Announcing result — Each election cycle lasts one day. Votes are counted after the cycle to
form new Council.

proposal to upgrade the RUNTIME logic if certain
consensus is reached within the Council.

Calling out a referendum

The Council has the right to call out a referendum at the
last minute with 2/3 majority when a malicious or wrong
referendum proposal is about to implement. Staked
assets behind the improper proposal are confiscated by
Treasury.

Technical committee has the right to submit an
emergency proposal with the Council’s permission when
a bug or upgrading need is detected. The proposal
immediately goes through the referendum without
further delay.

X-Association membership

The initial members including 1 secretary general and 4 secretaries are elected by the Council, but
to ensure management efficiency and continuity, X-Association when fully established, decides the
replacement of personnel on its own and reports to the Council about the changes. The council
has the right to remove one or more members with two-thirds majority. Dynamic working groups
under X-Association, led by the secretary general or a secretary, are set to complete specific tasks.

Bitcoin trusteeship

X-BTC1.0——Trust node
trusteeship scheme

In X-BTC 1.0, trustees are good-performing
nodes in Chainx’s testnet, with new nodes
chosen by abdicating ones, which requires
the Council's permission before taking effect.
There is a hot multi-signature address or
contract and a cold one generated by each
trust node. Funds are transferred to new
addresses after each renewal with users
having access to the real-time data of inter-
chain assets flow and reserves, thus no trust
node can unilaterally misappropriate the
fund.

20

The Bitcoin network cannot integrate light
nodes of other chains to form smart
contracts, which means assets are trapped in
their own systems. ChainX came up with a
scheme to break the dilemma with the "light
node + trusteeship” scheme that allows chain
crossing. So far Bitcoin light-node bridge and
X-BTC1.0 trusteeship scheme have been
finished, enabling completely decentralized
mapping of Bitcoin onto Chainx. In addition,
the latest logic framework of X-BTC
trusteeship has been established and will be
launched in the foreseeable future.

In X-BTC 1.0 trusteeship scheme, users
initiate a transaction from a Bitcoin account
to a multi-signature trustee address by
adding Chainx’s account address in the Note
to bind the two addresses together, which
once done, does not need repeating second
time for the network can automatically
recognize the binding. X-BTC is issued based
on the transactions of users’ Bitcoin address.

X-BTC 3.0 manages to cross assets onto
other chains with MPC in a network
composed of Trader nodes which contribute
computing power to sustain the system.
There are two main branches in MPC (Multi-
party Computation): "secure multi-party
computation based on garbled circuits" and
"secure multi-party computation based on
secret sharing", and X-BTC 3.0 uses the latter
which is based on Shamir's Secret Sharing to
encrypt and send out data.

ChainX plans to start with 100 seats and 28-
day election cycle. All trader nodes are
randomly grouped with the private key pieces
they are holding renewed every 48 hours.
Assume each group has N nodes, and each
transaction requires signatures of at least M
nodes(M<N) to be approved. There is also a
punishment system in place to deter trader
nodes from violating the agreement for
improper gains.

The main advantage of X-BTC 3.0 is the
complete decoupling between MPC and the
contract module, which means the chain is
able to connect with other chains as long
as the MPC algorithm is supported by the
chain and compatible with other chains.
MPC’s high compatibility with multi-chain
system is a prominent advantage and it is
off-chain, which avoids the risk of contract
being hacked, another highlight.

The Layer2 platform for Bitcoin —

How MPC works

Assume there are N participants. One of them
divides a private key, a password or sensitive
information into N encrypted pieces and sets
the retrieve threshold at M (M <N). This type
of encryption and decryption is usually
referred to as multi-signature. For example,
3/5 multi-signature requires at least 3
parties’ signature (encrypted pieces in
Shamir's Secret Sharing) to enable
transactions (decrypting the original priva
key, password or sensitive information).

The private key pieces are held by trader
nodes who need to cooperate with one other
to complete a transaction. Users can become
trader nodes by collateralizing assets, and
contribute their computing power for financial
gains without their identities being revealed.

X-BTC 4.0——Decentralized and
autonomous trusteeship scheme

26

X-BTC 4.0 modifies the MPC algorithm and
resets the threshold to enable users to hold
the private key pieces themselves, what’s
more the pieces they hold have the veto right,
which means a user’s assets cannot be
moved without his or her involvement in
decryption, thereby guarantees BTC asset
security in the trust and greatly reduces the
amount of collateral needed to a level even
lower than the amount of inter-chain assets.
This is the most ideal solution.

For example, if a user wants to redeem X-BTC, the steps are as following

© Calculate the number of needed encrypted pieces and send the request to relevant

trader nodes;

© N trader nodes respond with their own pieces;

© These nodes then send the request to other trader nodes in the same group;

© When anode receives more than M pieces, Signature_share_nodes are construted,
along with Signature_share_user to retrieve the private key and complete the

transaction signature.

Bitcoin derivative With record market value and decreasing
fluctuations, Bitcoin is recognized by more
platform mainstream institutions and has gradually

become a store of value. Against this
backdrop, there are growing demands for
hedging and leveraging tools when it comes to
digital asset investment. To meet the demand,
ChainX aspires to become the biggest Bitcoin
layer 2 financial platform with derivatives like
Bitcoin futures, options, synthetic assets and
swap agreements.

second-layer network.

Parallel transfer bridge
Split transfer bridges to independent
parachains to share the burden.

Various applications developed by the
community can run independently with inter-
chain connection being in place.

2Q)

Parachains are developed using
different types of blockchain
technology, and relay chains are
responsible for safeguarding the
network's co-sharing consensus and
facilitating inter—chain transactions
among parachains. Relay chain itself
does not deploy any applications. It is
parachains that develop and deploy
applications. Polkadot focusing on
efficient inter—chain connection within
its ecosystem advances the entire
blockchain development to a new level
and looks set to usher in blockchain
3.0. ChainX will run as the second—
layer network to Polkadot after it
releases the 2.0 version.

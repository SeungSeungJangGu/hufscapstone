Nexus Proof-of-Stake with Tritium Trust

Colin Cantrell Scott Simon

October 12, 2018
1 Introduction

The Nexus network operates using three channels for producing valid blocks
and minting new NXS currency — two Proof-of-Work channels and one Proof-
of-Stake channel. The original Proof-of-Stake channel introduced the con-
cept of trust as a core component to measure consistent and honest con-
tribution by a node to the Nexus network. It followed the philosophy of
everyone has time” in rewarding people for their time investment.

Tritium Trust represents the first in a series of releases implementing the
Tritium protocol on the Nexus network. With this release, activated in
Nexus version 0.2.5.0, the trust and Proof-of-Stake systems are revised and
enhanced. Through these changes, Nexus has laid the groundwork for future
releases of the TAO framework to include a Trust and Reputation system
as well as Trust Locks integral to the three dimensional chain} |

This paper discusses the details in the Tritium Trust release, specifically
with respect to the revised implementation of Nexus Proof-of-Stake.

2 Definition of Terms

2.1 General Terms

address - A unique sequence of characters that serves as a public identifier
enabling payments to you. When a payment is sent to an address, the
blockchain stores that transaction. The resulting balance can be thought of
as stored ”on” that address.

balance - The amount of a coin that you own. It can represent the total
amount, the amount accessed from a single wallet (the wallet balance), or
the amount accessed by a single address (the address balance). All balance is
stored on the blockchain, which serves as a ledger recording all transactions.

coin age - The blockchain may not store a balance in one location. It
is often split between multiple locations. Coin age represents an average
measure of how long it has been stored in its current locations.

coinbase transaction - Proof-of-Work miners add this transaction to
each block they mine. It mints (creates) new coins in the form of a reward
paid to the address of the miner who created the block.

coinstake transaction - The Proof-of-Stake counterpart to the coinbase
transaction. It mints new coins to pay a reward for creating a new Proof-
of-Stake block.

key - Cryptographic algorithms generally use two keys that form a pair: a
private key that is secret to the person holding it, and a public key that can
be shared. For cryptocurrencies, the term key typically refers to the private
key. This is the key stored in your wallet. It can create digital signatures
allowing only you to access and spend your coins. The public key is used to
derive the public address, which is shorter and more easily shared than the
key itself.

node _ - A computer that is connected to a blockchain network and running
the network’s blockchain software. This cryptocurrency node stores a copy
of the blockchain itself and supports the network by validating and relaying
both blocks and transactions. Most cryptocurrency nodes also include a
wallet interface allowing the computer owner to use the system.

Proof-of-Stake(PoS) - A form of mining based on ownership of a cur-
rency. This ownership represents a ”stake” in the sense of an interest in
something. PoS miners prove their stake by solving a relatively simple com-
putational problem that requires ownership to perform. By doing so, they
become eligible to create a new block and earn a reward. This process is
often referred to as ”staking your coins”, and the resulting reward as the
*staking reward” .

Proof-of-Work(PoW) - A form of mining based on a computational
problem that is complex to solve but simple to verify. Presenting a so-
lution proves that the work to solve the problem was performed, granting
the miner the right to create a new block and earn a reward.

wallet - A software program that stores your private keys and correspond-
ing addresses enabling access to your balance on the blockchain. A wallet
does not actually store your coins, only your keys. The wallet balance rep-
resents the value stored on the blockchain that is accessible by the keys in
the wallet.

2.2 Nexus Terms

block age - For Nexus Proof-of-Stake, this refers to the amount of time
since a wallet successfully mined its last PoS block and added it to the
blockchain. In other words, how old is the most recent PoS block created
by that wallet?

Genesis - The initial phase of Nexus Proof-of-Stake that allows a new
wallet to participate in staking. Each wallet only performs this process
once. When a wallet successfully mines its first PoS block, the Genesis
process creates a trust key in the wallet, which is used for all PoS from that
point forward.

Genesis transaction - The coinstake transaction of the PoS block found
by a wallet during its initial Genesis phase.

Trust transaction - The coinstake transaction of any PoS block found
after the wallet completes its Genesis phase.

trust key - The private key created in your wallet by the Genesis process.
The public NXS address associated with this key is used for all staking
reward payments. The staking process also moves the current wallet balance
and stores it on this address, along with a record of the trust score.

trust score - Reflects the network’s internal level of trust assigned to a
trust key as a measure of the equivalent time the key owner has operated a
node in an honest, trustworthy, and timely manner. This measure of time is
not absolute. It is accrued during normal operation, but the accrued amount
can be reduced when not honest, trustworthy, or timely.

TAO framework - The three phases for implementing the Nexus three
dimensional chain, named Tritium, Amine, and Obsidian respectively. Each
represents a major update implementing one dimension of the overall archi-
tecture, and may be comprised of one or more releases.

Tritium - The first phase of implementing the Nexus three dimensional
chain, as defined in the Tritium White Paper] Tritium itself will be com-
prised of a series of releases: Tritium Trust, the Nexus Tritium Wallet, and
Tritium Core. Tritium Trust implements changes to the trust and PoS sys-
tem, the Tritium Wallet provides a completely updated wallet experience
and implements the interface layer of the architecture, and Tritium Core
implements the remaining major architectural updates needed for full im-
plementation of the protocol.

3 Proof-of-Stake

3.1 What is Proof-of-Stake?

The concept of Proof-of-Stake was first introduced in 2012 by King & Nadaf}]
as a proposal to develop a form of mining that addressed the growing issue of
energy consumption related to Bitcoin Proof-of-Work mining. It developed
the idea of using proof of ownership of a currency as a means for granting
the ability to mine blocks on the blockchain. These blocks would include a
coinstake transaction that rewarded the currency owner in a manner similar
to how coinbase transactions reward Proof-of-Work miners.

Early incarnations of Proof-of-Stake built around the idea of coin age. Upon
reaching a specified coin age, the currency owner would gain the ability to
stake a new block on the blockchain.

This design elegantly solved the issue of energy efficiency, but had the draw-
back that, unlike other forms of mining, the currency owner didn’t have to
do anything. They could simply leave their wallet off, and only activate it
upon reaching the age level needed to earn rewards without contributing to
the network as a whole.

As a result, Proof-of-Stake was gradually refined. It remained a form of
energy efficient mining, but evolved into a mechanism whereby currency
holders can earn rewards proportional to the size of their holdings in return

proof-of-stake” |nttps : //peercoin.net/assets/paper/peercoin-paper . pdf

for keeping a node up and running at all (or nearly all) times, thus con-
tributing to the operation and security of the blockchain network.

3.2 Staking Concepts

Time

Proof-of-Stake introduced time as an input to mining, initially through the
use of coin age. Using time in this manner inhibits the application of raw
computational power to solve blocks more quickly, thus promoting energy
efficiency. Requiring a significant time investment to stake successfully also
introduces an external cost to any potential attacker. This improves network
security.

Weight

Different Proof-of-Stake systems use varying ideas for the concept of weight.
Basically, all of these introduce an approach where the ability of currency
owners is weighted in such a manner that some have a higher chance to
generate blocks than others. Coin age based systems were often weighted
based on the number of coins owned, so if two people had the same holding
period, but one had twice as many coins as the other, that one would have
twice as much opportunity to mine staking blocks.

Minting Rate
This rate, expressed as an annual percentage, is used to calculate the size
of the coinstake reward in a PoS block from the time invested in creating it
and the overall PoS balance.

As PoS grew more popular, minting rate became more commonly referred
to as interest rate because it operates in a similar manner and people al-
ready have an understanding of that term. However, anyone staking should
understand that their coins are not earning interest. They are mining
staking rewards in return for helping operate and secure the blockchain
network.

Distribution Problem

A pure PoS-based currency suffers from a chicken-and-egg problem that you
cannot mine staking blocks without coins to stake. Those coins must first
be minted by another process. Therefore, most currencies that use Proof-
of-Stake also employ an initial distribution based on Proof-of-Work mining,
at least temporarily.

Although Nexus uses 3 mining channels primarily to enhance security, this
design also supports initial distribution via the Proof-of-Work channels.

Nothing At Stake Problem
Proof-of-Work mining requires the consumption of large amounts of energy,
which is a valuable resource. A basic Proof-of-Stake system, on the other
hand, only uses resources already within the network, and you don’t lose
anything for behaving dishonestly or signing all blocks on any fork in the
chain, then attempting to build on all forks. There is no cost or “nothing
at stake” for doing so. It is a hypothetical problem that nevertheless must
be addressed by any staking system.

In addition to other benefits, the use of multiple channels in Nexus also ad-
dresses this problem, as the disparate channels keep each other honest. The
Nexus network also uses the concept of trust to create a cost to misbehavior.

51% Attack

As with other forms of mining, Proof-of-Stake systems can potentially be
exposed to a 51% attack that gives the attacker control of the network. Un-
der this type of system, however, it requires an attacker to gain control of
at least 51% of the currency on the network. This becomes incredibly ex-
pensive to do, and thus highly unlikely, especially when you add limitations
to block frequency and combine it with a significant time requirement for
generating staking weight.

Within Nexus, not only is it highly unlikely a 51% attack could occur on
the Proof-of-Stake channel, but an attacker would also have to gain control
of both Proof-of-Work channels to be successful.

Inflation

Defining the minting rate is an important aspect of any staking system. Too
low and rewards are not significant enough to encourage nodes to stake. Too
high and the resulting inflation of the currency supply will erode its value,
especially when compounded over time. Inflation can rapidly become the
nemesis for systems promising excessively high rewards.
The Nexus initial distribution will create a supply of 78 million NXS, ending
on September 23, 2024. After that, it will follow an inflationary model based
on the annual inflation of gold supply from mining. Gold has kept its value
for centuries, so this level of inflation has proven economically sustainable.

Under this model, after the initial distribution ends each Proof-of-Work
channel will inflate supply by 1% per year, and the Proof-of-Stake channel
will allow a maximum of 3%. This 3% value could only be realized if the en-
tire NXS supply were staked at the maximum Interest Rate. Realistically,
Proof-of-Stake inflation will likely fall in line with the other two minting
channe

4 Nexus Proof-of-Stake

The Tritium Trust release builds on the previous Nexus Proof-of-Stake sys-
tem. It employs many of the staking concepts developed in previous staking
systems, enhances them, and adds new concepts that further enhance per-
formance and security for Proof-of-Stake.

4.1 Genesis

Before a new wallet can stake successfully on the Nexus network, it must
first create a trust key. This key is created by successfully mining its first
Proof-of-Stake block, a process referred to as Genesis.

While staking for Genesis, the node will slowly build Trust Weight (see sec-
tion 4.2). Over time, this added weight increases the chances of mining a
PoS block and generating a Genesis transaction. The pre-Genesis value for
Trust Weight only applies to the Genesis process and is based on coin age.
It caps at a level of 11% of maximum, as shown in Figure [I]

As part of the Genesis transaction, the wallet also creates the trust key and
transfers all balance to that key’s address for staking. This has no impact
on the wallet balance, besides moving it to the new address.

Under Tritium Trust, each wallet will only perform Genesis once. After it
creates a trust key, it will continue to use it for the remainder of the lifetime

of that wallet.

4.2 Trust

Upon creating a new trust key, the network immediately begins to build the
internal trust score associated with that key. Continued staking will gen-
erate additional Trust transactions whenever the node successfully mines a
Proof-of-Stake block. Each additional transaction rewards the wallet owner
for continuing to operate their node.

Continued staking also sustains the trust score and allows it to keep accru-
ing. As long as the trust key does not undergo Decay (see section 4.5) or
get penalized for misbehavior, trust score will continue to grow.

The internal trust score is important for Nexus Proof-of-Stake, because it
indicates the network’s level of trust in the associated trust key. With more
trust, the network awards that key a higher weight for staking and a higher
Interest Rate (see Section 4.3). The weight it awards is indicated by the
Trust Weight. A higher value for Trust Weight increases the chances of suc-

Figure [2| depicts the relationship between trust score and Trust Weight. It
shows how Trust Weight, expressed as a percentage of its maximum possible
value, grows as accrued trust score, expressed as days of time, increases.

As with the Genesis transaction, Trust transactions will also transfer any
new NXS sent to the wallet onto the trust key’s address for staking.

4.3 Interest Rate (Minting Rate of Staking Rewards)

Unlike Proof-of Work mining, Nexus Proof-of-Stake does not have a set re-
ward for finding blocks. Instead, the reward size is calculated from the trust
key’s current Interest Rate (minting rate), the time it took to find the block,
and the wallet balance. The Genesis stage uses a fixed rate of 0.5% (annual).
After Genesis, the network determines Interest Rate from its current level
of trust, as measured by the accrued trust score.

This annual interest rate ranges from the starting value of 0.5% to a max-
oO

Figure[3|depicts how Interest Rate, expressed as an annual percentage, grows
as accrued trust score, expressed in days of time, increases. Interest Rate
caps when it reaches the maximum value of 3%.

4.4 Block Weight

The Block Weight represents a second weight value. It combines with Trust
Weight (see section 4.2) to increase the chances for mining a new PoS block.

Block Weight derives from the amount of time since the wallet last mined a
PoS block, as measured by its block age. The older the last block, the more
weight it contributes to finding a new one, up to a maximum value reached
after three days.

During Genesis, the wallet has not yet mined any Proof-of-Stake blocks.
The block age value remains zero, and so does the Block Weight. Upon

10
mining the first PoS block, Nexus begins measuring the age of that block,
and Block Weight will begin increasing.

Whenever the wallet mines an additional PoS block, Nexus begins measur-
ing the block age of the new block in place of the prior one. This has the
effect of resetting Block Weight and it starts growing again as the new block
age increases.

Figure [4] depicts how Block Weight, expressed as a percentage of maximum
value, grows as block age increases.

Block Age (Hours)

Figure 4: Block Weight

If, after 3 days (72 hours), Block Weight reaches 100%, the trust key will
begin to undergo Decay (see section 4.5).

4.5 Decay

Tritium Trust introduces the process of Decay if a wallet fails to mine blocks
in a timely manner. To stay timely, the wallet must mine a new PoS block
before the block age of the previous one reaches three days. This time limit

11
is reached when the Block Weight reaches 100%.

If the wallet reaches the 3-day limit without mining a new PoS block, the
trust key does not expire. Instead, the trust score associated with that key
will reset back to the level of its previous Trust transaction. Any trust score
added since then is lost. Then it begins to decay from that point. Trust
score decays at a 3:1 ratio to the rate it was accrued.

Ts = Ty — 3+ (ay — 259200) (1)
Where T, = new trust score, 7, = prior trust score at last transaction, apy =

block age (time since last PoS block, in seconds), and 259200 is three days
expressed in seconds.

Normally, Trust Weight depicted in F igure [2] moves forward along the curve
as trust score grows. During Decay, it effectively moves backward along the
same curve. The same would be true of Interest Rate in Figure [3}

Decay ends if, at any time, the wallet mines a new stake block and generates
a Trust transaction. Trust score begins accruing again from that point.

The benefit of Decay in Tritium Trust is that trust keys no longer expire.
They simply add or subtract trust score. Those who have invested a lot of
time building trust will not have it expire from a random event such as a
power outage. Trust score might decay somewhat, but it can be earned back.

The time investment that it takes to build trust score, combined with this
introduction of the ability to both add and subtract trust score, also sup-
ports administration of trust penalties for misbehavior or dishonesty, and
forms the basis for future application as part of a Trust and Reputation
system within the Nexus TAO framework.

4.6 Use of Coin Age in Nexus

Enough different Proof-of-Stake systems have used coin age in different ways
that it can become a matter of confusion. While this document already
shows coin age in the places where Nexus uses it, summing this up in one
section will clarify it better.

12
With one exception, Nexus only uses coin age during the Genesis stage.
Coin age determines the minimum time to wait before you can stake a new
wallet. It also determines Trust Weight and the reward included in the Gen-
esis transaction.

After Genesis mines the first PoS block, Tritium Trust uses trust score and
block age in place of coin age. It only considers coin age if you add new
NXS to your wallet. In that case, the previous balance stored on the trust
key’s address earns a reward based on block age, but the new NXS amount
only earns a reward for the time after adding it to the wallet (its coin age).
The next Trust transaction will take that into account while also moving
the new amount onto the trust key’s address. After that, the coin age is no
longer considered.

Note that, after Genesis, coin age has no impact on trust score, Trust Weight,
Block Weight, or Interest Rate.

5 Begin Staking with a New Wallet

5.1 Establishing a Trust Key

Trust is not something easily earned in real life. Nor is it easily established
in Nexus Proof-of-Stake. Establishing a new trust key is a process. This
process can take a fair amount of time, especially for smaller balances.

After Genesis successfully mines the initial PoS block and creates the trust
key, the trust score associated with that key begins accruing but starts
small. This results in a low Trust Weight value that does not contribute
much weight for mining additional blocks. Trust transactions remain infre-
quent.

It is normal at this stage if it doesn’t mine a new PoS block within the
required three day period. As the key is new, Decay immediately reduces
trust score to its starting value (the trust level of its prior transaction) when
Block Weight reaches 100%.

From that point, Block Weight will stay at 100% while it continues to search
for a PoS block, but Trust Weight and Interest Rate revert to minimum

13
starting values (1.11% and 0.5% respectively). These values will not change
until it mines a stake block and generates a Trust transaction. Then, trust
score begins to grow again.

This cycle may repeat multiple times before a new trust key can generate
enough Trust transactions with enough frequency to avoid Decay and accu-
mulate trust score. This is normal. It is all part of earning trust.

5.2 Nexus Staking Requirements

Minimum Balance

No matter how much NXS you have, you can operate a node and mine re-
wards using Nexus Proof-of-Stake. There is no minimum amount required.
You are guaranteed to receive staking rewards calculated using the starting
0.5% Interest Rate.

However, if you have a higher balance, it will find PoS blocks and create
Trust transactions more frequently, and therefore have a greater likelihood
of growing trust score to higher levels. This also grows the Interest Rate for
calculating staking rewards, up to the maximum of 3%.

Minimum Coin Age

Before a wallet can attempt Genesis and mine its first PoS block, it requires a
minimum coin age of 72 hours. A new wallet that just received its first NXS
must wait this long to begin staking. Any additional sending or receiving
of NXS during this time alters the coin age, which may increase how long it
must wait.

Hardware

You can stake NXS on any system supported by the latest Nexus wallet
version. Currently, that includes computers running 64-bit versions of Win-
dows, MacOS§, or Linux. Devices such as mobile phones or Raspberry Pi are
not yet supported. The staking process does not require a high powered ma-
chine, though. Many use older laptops or mini-systems like the Intel NUC
to minimize power usage.

Maturity
Proof-of-Stake is a form of mining and, as with Proof-of-Work, must wait a
minimum period for the staking transaction to mature. For Nexus, maturity

14
takes 120 blocks (around 90 minutes). During this time, the wallet balance
will display as ”Staking” and not be available for other use. If you send
additional NXS to the wallet during the maturity period, it will be available
immediately.

Three Day Requirement

As previously noted, a wallet must successfully mine a new PoS block and
generate a Trust transaction within three days of its prior one. If not, the
trust score will experience Decay.

6 Technical Details

This section specifies the detailed formulae Tritium Trust uses to calculate
values discussed in the prior sections. These replace the now-obsolete cal-
culations originally documented in the Nexus white paper[}]

6.1 Trust Weight

As previously discussed, Tritium Trust uses two different calculations for
Trust Weight, one based on coin age during the Genesis process and one
based on current trust score for the remainder of staking.

The internal value of Trust Weight ranges from 1 to 90, although it is com-
monly expressed as a percentage of its maximum value.

Tritium Trust only uses this while attempting to mine the initial PoS block.

6.2 Interest Rate (Minting Rate of Staking Rewards)

The staking reward included in the Genesis transaction is calculated using
the starting rate of 0.5%. All subsequent rewards for mining PoS blocks use
a minting rate calculated from accumulated trust score.

Where C,, is the current wallet balance and S$; is the staking reward.

Trust Transaction

The staking reward received in a Trust transaction has two possible com-
ponents. The first part is the reward for balance stored on the trust key’s
address, based on the block age (time since last staking transaction). The
second part accounts for any new NXS balance added to the wallet. This
NXS only earns rewards for the time since adding it.

Sn = 31449600 (7)

Where C;, is any new NXS added to the wallet, a. is the coin age of that
new balance, and 5S, is the resulting staking reward. New NXS is then
transferred to the trust key’s address for further staking.

The total reward for a trust transaction S, = S;+ Sy

6.4 Block Weight

Tritium Trust only calculates Block Weight after Genesis mines the initial
PoS block. It uses the block age of the most recent PoS block mined.

The numeric value of Block Weight ranges from 1 to 10, although it is com-
monly expressed as a percentage of its maximum value.

W, = Min(10.0, 2.0m ato) + 1.0) (8)

6.5 Stake Weight

Stake Weight is a derivative measure that depicts the combined weight ef-
fect of Trust Weight and Block Weight on overall chances to generate a
block. The Required Threshold (see Section 6.6) uses Trust Weight and
Block Weight directly, so the value of Stake Weight is for informative pur-
poses only.

W,=W+W, (9)

As shown previously, internal values for Trust Weight range from 1-90 and
Block Weight from 1-10. Thus, Stake Weight will range from 2-100, and can
be directly expressed as a percentage.

17
6.6 Required Threshold
__ (108—W,—W,)-1000
fy = (Cw+5r) 9)

The value for Energy Efficiency Threshold must be above this value for the
wallet to attempt stake block generation.

6.7 Energy Efficiency Threshold

100-t

Where ty is the time since the last block was added to the blockchain, in
seconds.

The Tritium Trust staking process will iterate over the process of attempting
to find a block hash that meets PoS difficulty requirements, incrementing
Nonce With each iteration. Whenever this causes the value for the Energy
Efficiency Threshold to fall below the Required Threshold, it will stop.

As the time since the last block increases, so will the Energy Efficiency
Threshold and it can begin iterating again. Higher Trust Weight, Block
Weight, and wallet balance reduce the Required Threshold, thus allowing
for a greater number of iterations and increasing the possibility of mining a
block.

This continues until it finds a PoS block or it receives a new block from the
network. If it receives a new block, the process resets and starts over.

Another way of looking at this process is through the understanding of Proof-
of-Stake as a form of mining. In effect, the math, weights, and thresholds
only exist to determine the effective ”hash rate” for Proof-of-Stake. In the
end, this hash rate determines how often, on average, it will find a block
and earn a reward, just like with Proof-of-Work mining.

If you mine using Proof-of-Work, and wish to generate more results, then
you add more hash rate. With Proof-of-Stake, you do the same. The most
effective way to increase Proof-of-Stake hashing is to add more balance to
the wallet, though building trust also does so.

18
Through this process, the staking algorithm produces a non-intensive, effi-
cient process] based on the parameters of the wallet’s trust key, avoiding
the need for a lot of expensive hardware and energy consumption.

7 Summary

With the activation of Nexus 0.2.5.0, the Tritium Trust release revises and
enhances the Nexus Proof-of-Stake system as a method for mining NXS. It
eliminates the expiration of trust keys and implements trust score as both
a measure of the network’s level of trust and as a primary input for deter-
mining updated staking parameters.

Trust score can both increase through continued mining of PoS blocks in a
timely manner, and decrease through the process of Decay. This lays the
groundwork for further development of Trust and Reputation within the
Nexus architecture as part of the overall TAO framework.

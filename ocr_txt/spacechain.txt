ABSTRACT

SpaceChain aims to pioneer solutions for humanity to thrive in the
coming space age. Combining blockchain technology with current
astronautical resources and capabilities, SpaceChain will inspire
more people to join the space community and advance the propers
of space technologies together.

SpaceChain positions itself as a private space agency with an open
network driven by collaboration and transparency, using blockchain
based technologies. Activating the principles of decentralization and
international collaboration in an already vibrant global community,
SpaceChain will leverage the dynamics of tokens and private
funding to accelerate space development.

SpaceChain was founded in March 2017 and has completed the
development of SpaceChain Operating System (SpaceChain OS).
SpaceChain OS has been successfully adapted to the Sparc V8
satellite operating system and achieved stable operations at the system
level. The SpaceChain OS integrates Qtum blockchain technology

and has established a platform for the development of space based
applications. SpaceChain will be releasing fully functional satellites
using the SpaceChain OS blockchain nodes in 2018.

By harnessing the power of tokens, private funding and leadership,
SpaceChain provides on an open source platform to accelerate outer
space development and settlement. We will choose and execute
missions that fit this blockchain-based philosophy.

The Value of

Blockchain & Space

Technology

1.1 The Trend of of Internet Technology Innovation: Blockchain

The blockchain is a computer programming breakthrough
that solved the Byzantine Generals problem. Also known
as the Byzantine fault tolerance and an “error avalanche,”
this concept was a generalized “unsolvable” proof that led
to roadblocks in software development. We have always
needed a third party that demanded a payment to perform
transactions or submit information to ensure that the
transactions were accurate and create a reliable history.
Blockchain enables trusted exchange without middleman.

It creates a secure and resilient shared history which is
accessible anywhere in the world. The first real-world
application of blockchain is Bitcoin. Beyond cryptocurrency,
blockchain allows us to program transactions and signals
that allow for a decentralized, self-governing network with
no middleman and executable contracts between machines
called ‘smart contracts.’

New technology can emerge in a manner that seems out-
of-the-blue even though it is the culmination of decades

of intense research and development by near-anonymous
collaborators. Societies that encounter this technology when
it is finally ready for users divide into two camps - idealists
citing it as proof of a revolution or establishmentarians who
heap scorn on and attribute harm to the technology. A small
subset of society trained in technology develops, discusses,
and explores its capabilities. At this point, commercial
interests that look for new ways to do business usually
intervene and mainstream products are built on the findings.
Profound changes then occur in commerce and culture.
This evolutionary arc has characterised technologies from
the printing press in 1440, personal computing in 1975, the
Internet in 1993 and most recently, blockchain in 2008.

Blockchain has received its share of news
coverage in recent years and has captured
the interest of technologists and economists
since 2008. It solved the “avalanche of

errors” that the open Internet presented
where otherwise unrelated parties interact
over an untrusted network. For the first time,
information like digital signatures, digital
contracts, digital keys to physical locks, digital
ownership of physical assets like real estate
and digital money could take place in a matter
of minutes between untrusted parties with no
need for a middle institution brokering history
or ensuring honesty. And once the transaction
is complete, it is final. Blockchains represent
the Internet-wide distributed ledger (or shared
history) and server for both information and
commerce that cannot be rolled back (also
known as immutable). Blockchain is the first
true community powered super computer.
Now, blockchain can power smart contracts
taking complex legal, commercial, and cultural
interactions programmed with no third party
intervention to execute between machines like
computers, sensors, or systems like grids.

Page 4 | SpaceChain White Paper V 1.0

1.2 Brief History of Telecommunication & Internet
Evolution

The future is already here, it is up to us to equally
distribute it.

A brief history of the Internet and discussion of the
evolution of blockchain reveals a true revolution

of our capabilities to understand, explore our

world, and ultimately advance our species through
technology. The combination of the Internet and

the computer was a leap forward in our capacity

as a species. Combining worldwide broadcasting,
instant information dissemination, and platforms for
collaboration without geographic location has opened
new avenues for advancing a more transparent and
collaborative world where breakthroughs can benefit
all of humanity, all at once.

The Internet, in the context of our global
telecommunications evolution, represents the

most successful example of sustained, global,
collaborative, decentralized development of
information infrastructure. Blockchain, originated
from Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper, represents how
the economic collaborative component is driving
Internet evolution. The decentralized Internet

today has become the widespread information and
economic infrastructure and forms the true initial
prototype of what has been called the National
Galactic Information Infrastructure. As JCR Licklider
of MIT wrote in a historic memo in 1962 discussing
the concept of a “Galactic Network” of a globally
interconnected set of computers through which
anyone at any location could access and change data
and programs, so did Satoshi Nakamoto envision a
purely “peer-to-peer version of electronic cash” that
would “allow any one party” to send value to anyone
else they chose without a third party intermediary on
a series of computers running software called nodes.
Tog Ethereum protocoler, with advances in computer
programming on blockchain with programming

and smart contracts like Qtum, we finally have the
capability to fully transform entire industries.

SpaceChain is advancing the evolution of

the decentralized Internet to the next level by
essentially inventing true decentralized multi-
tenant software capabilities and networked space
on a satellite system. SpaceChain is building a
universal OS that can be used across any satellite
to transform satellites into multi-use computers
rather than the single use satellites that are
prevalent today.

1.3 Technical Platforms Have Led to the Era of
Decentralized Space Tech

Currently the international space industry has two
prevailing problems that hinder the development of
this industry as a whole:
¢ First, are security issues, which mainly
exists between countries;

¢ Second, conflicts of interest between
commercial corporates and
state-owned companies.

The first issue is being addressed by diplomacy
and cooperation encouraged by leaders and
communities through collaboration and open
source technology. SpaceChain addresses the
second issue. Space technologies have always
been closed source and highly guarded. The
problem is that in this type of environment, it is
difficult for new businesses to utilize the existing
infrastructure, and access workable knowledge
outside of the organization, and for countries to
audit projects. Businesses have also avoided
space technologies due to the high capital
requirement. Unlike other software arenas, it is
not possible to build space-based applications
with low budgets. Lack of human capital,
specialized professionals, and limited talent are
also major constraints.
Page 5 | SpaceChain White Paper V 1.0 |

Current space projects are dominated by governments, so they are hindered by external
factors and become inefficient. Research and innovation are under-resourced. Purely
commercialized space projects like SpaceX deserve more attention and are indeed seeing
high valuations from very modest upfront investments.

At the dawn of Internet age, startups benefited greatly from the traditional venture capital
model. Typically, a business is owned by key members of the company and the shareholders
keep working in the company and make contributions. Innovation and creativity of
entrepreneurs in technology were able to thrive and succeed with the support of venture
capital. However, for companies that require longer time and larger initial outlays for research
and development (R&D) such as space exploration, VC model is not necessary the best
option. Many technologies based on the VC model would be announced as unworkable when
they need more time and capital investment to succeed and reach markets to thrive.

For example, traditional satellite research and development cycles may drag across many
decades. Once the funding for research is ready, it takes months to complete research and
development before teams can apply for additional funding for next stages to get technologies
to market. We have seen projects spend 5 years stuck in this cycle only to have their satellite
prototype unable to launch.

Tokenized fund raising provides flexibility and progressive ways to support such projects.
With sufficient funding, the project can recruit the best talent, enhance internal efficiency and
focus more on the long-term R&D. This is very important within space technology, where
setbacks are to be expected and part of the cost of development. Hence, traditional VCs may
not be willing to take the risk and leave this space to us to achieve somEthereum protocoling
great under a crypto-economic model. Long-term feasibility and timeframes can be reached
with smart contracts to lock and hold token sale funds with a clear roadmap and timeline for
deliverables.

SpaceChain is a private space agency that will partner other organizations where crowdsourced
funding can be employed on collaborative projects and smart contracts employed to lock in funds
till certain software markers are met to unlock them. SpaceChain’s decentralized application
platform built on satellite technology will begin the opening of this industry and community.
SpaceChain will promote SpaceChain OS to traditional space industry satellites, such as
communication and navigation, among others. Also, SpaceChain will promote SpaceChain
verification system to better aggregate and utilize current space resources in an open source,
audited, and secure system. SpaceChain OS can be developed and used by different satellites
and different organizations wherever they are located in the world.
Page 6 | SpaceChain White Paper V 1.0 |

1.4 Introducing SpaceChain

SpaceChain aims to establish a network infrastructure that is very much like the public telecommunication
infrastructure we share globally. This network infrastructure will not involve any military or government bodies, and
is only for use by the general public and by private individuals and organizations. People can access, build, and
interact like they do on the Internet. SpaceChain’s first application is like a mobile app development platform. With
blockchain software, we provide an application sandbox or app firewall so that independent apps may be uploaded
to the satellite similar to apps on a mobile application layer. Until now, inter-satellite links (satellite to satellite
communications) present a fundamental hurdle to a decentralized mesh network.In order to have this resilient
mesh network, you first need satellite-to-satellite communication that is blockchain based.

However, there are still security issues related to commercial satellites such as data integrity and safety of the
satellite. SpoaceChain invented SpaceChain OS which is a sandboxed blockchain technology that is built upon
StylixOS and Qtum. This system will ensure the safety of data running on the satellite as the programs are
operated at the immutable and completely public blockchain layer.

The aim of SpaceChain OS is to enhance hardware capability while maintaining security. SpaceChain OS can
adapt to global hardware systems and cater to varying satellite technologies. In order to ensure the safety features
and functions of SpaceChain OS, the foundation will carefully evaluate each generation of SpaceChain OS through
in-orbit testing, and it will provide the community with reliable open-source code and results. For more detailed
SpaceChain OS information, please refer to “SpaceChain OS Whitepaper”.

Internally, SpaceChain will tokenize and equalize technology and
resources. This will optimize use of available technology and
resources, and provide the space industry with an efficient and
reliable consensus on value and collaboration to begin.

SpaceChain was funded in March 2017 and has already
provided solutions in the space frontier. SpaceChain OS
development with infrastructure design and operating system
started in November 2017. SpaceChain OS has been
successfully adapted to Sparc V8 satellite operating system, and
has achieved stable operation at the smallest system level. The
migration from Qtum blockchain technology has achieved basic
sandbox function, and the EVM Virtual Machine is on track to
being developed in 2018.

« Further: move forward with the hardware and software upgrades while conducting in-orbit testing.

SpaceChain’s goal is to integrate blockchain nodes on satellites to add a new dimension to the core framework
of distributed ledgers. SpaceChain’s node satellites will bring blockchain to space and make use of existing
space technology to build a worldwide distributed application layer. We are pioneering a new layer of
infrastructure for the Internet of blockchains by taking advantage of space resources. SpaceChain’s platform
features data collection, computing, applications, and storage. SpaceChain uses satellites as its operational
nodes for realizing direct on-satellite data processing and secure in-space data storage through cryptographic
technologies such as quantum communications. People everywhere will have access to this layer of
infrastructure, just as they do the Internet wherever they travel with their various devices.
Page 8 | SpaceChain White Paper V 1.0 |

SpaceChain will bring satellite technology beyond a repeater model
(RM).Our partner will provide better language than traditional RM.
RM essentially describes how most current satellites function.

They usually take a signal from the ground and then simply
broadcast live satellite tv or provide GPS or one other function at

a time. RM allows very little actual data processing to take place

on the satellite. SpaceChain’s system will change this model to a
model that is multi-tenant with flexible software capabilities. Most
satellites are single owner and thus single operator and single
tenant. With SpaceChain, for the first time combining existing space
technology and blockchain, we are able to create multi-tenant as a
new user model and a new economic model for satellites.

Additionally, SpaceChain has created a system to drive down

the cost of space applications to allow teams and investors to do

more development with their money. SpaceChain will combine and
contract the cheapest rocket launches globally with multiple payoffs
per rocket. As more cheap spacecraft reach orbit, we are able to
have many redundant nodes in the network launched globally.

Thus, our network also self-heals. We can see a mesh network in
space of many satellites where loss and replacement will enable the
network to be low cost and resilient in a “many plus cheap” model.
These rockets will take off from many different sites and be ensured
secure by open source, auditable practices that the larger respected
technology and space communities can see and support. SpaceChain
will employ this mEthereum protocolod to projects we undertake in
space, including asteroids or planetary bodies exploration where we
can send out many remote drones powered by apps run on satellites
around celestial bodies in our planetary system. Hardware design
also involves internal redundancies especially as spacecraft using our
‘smart’ satellites will have redundancy of computing.

2.2 The Hardware of SpaceChain: Future of Internet Infrastructure
What follows is a technical breakdown of SpaceChain from both the hardware and software perspectives.

The key function of the blockchain payload is processing application safely on the satellite. To achieve this goal,
the payload uses SpaceChain OS to provide the software environment to applications. Blockchain sandbox
provides a safe environment and a high performance chip to guarantee all the software above. The main logic
structure is shown below.

The beta vision payload hardware is on-board CPU and FPGA.

The Payload provides a powerful processing module for Blockchain applications and OS. The module contains
two main parts:

* Avery powerful ARM/FPGA on-board computer (OBC) designed as an efficient system for space application

« The power system is divided into two, one for ARM and one for FPGA

* Dual ARM Cortex A9 MPCore up to 800 MHz

*1GB DDR3 RAM/4 GB storage

+ Powerful FPGA module — 125K logic cells

* Precision milled anodized aluminum heat sink to
control thermal load and provide EMI shielding

* Operational temperature: -40°C to +60°C

+ PCB material: 22 layer glass/polyimide

+ IPC-A-610 Class 3 assembly

Page 11 | SpaceChain White Paper V 1.0 |

In the future, blockchain payload will be rapidly upgraded to meet the future demand of blockchain applications.
However, the existing processors have different problems that will slow the update rate down. For example,

* x86 is complex and not open source, the internal structure of the processor is not clear, there may be a back
door,unable to be safely controlled;

* ARM has expensive intellectual property costs that will reduce user number;

* SPARC is product of commercial companies; whole technical system has long-term sustained support risk;

+ MIPS and Power belongs to commercial companies which are focused on making profits, and their business
model may not promote democratisation of technology. It is easy to have conflicts of interest with upstream and
downstream companies; it may lack good industrial chain ecological support.

To satisfy the update rate of blockchain payload, we need an open source processor project. In 2010, David

Patterson, a distinguished professor at UC Berkeley, launched the RISC-V processor open source project,
which has great properties like:

+ Free authorization, no patent barriers exist Block Diagram
* Permanent non-profit foundation to ) ( (

At present, there are 50 core member companies, Connectors

270 companies and 29 universities participating ( )
in the RISC-V open source project. In the future, Satan
SpaceChain will develop a blockchain payload X /

'

Functional description

The OBC is based on a Zynq-7000 All Programmable SoC (AP SoC) devices
integrate the software programmability of an ARM-based processor with the hardware
programmability of an FPGA, enabling key analytics and hardware acceleration while
integrating CPU, DSP and mixed signal functionality on a single device.

Microcontroller

os The OBC has a default SpaceChain OS installed.

OBC has an I2C bus supporting bidirectional data transfer between masters and
slaves, multi- master bus, arbitration between simultaneously transmitting masters

I2C Interface without corruption of serial data on the bus. Serial clock synchronization allows
devices with different bit rates to communicate via one serial bus and is used as a
handshake mechanism to suspend and resume serial transfer.

One of the main interfaces of the OBC to communicate with other subsystem
hardware is a Controller Area Network (CAN) bus interface. It is a serial
communications protocol that supports distributed real- time control with a high
level of security.

2.2.3 Qtum & StylixOx: SpaceChain OS

SpaceChain will provide funding and
support for startups in the space industry in
terms of technology, resource, and human
capital. At the same time, these startups
will use SpaceChain’s verification system
so they can quickly commercialize and
produce products and services thatsociety
needs globally.

The most effective solution to alleviate

the expense problem will be to encourage
cooperation between companies while also
significantly increase the usage rate per
satellite. In the same way the mobile phone
industry was revolutionized when Apple
introduced the iPhone with its exceptionally
usable iOS, SpaceChain introduces a
universal space iOS for space software
development. The space industry needs a
stable and versatile operating system, and
SpaceChain OS is the solution.

Developers can create applications

using the environment provided by
SpaceChain OS. SpaceChain OS greatly
lowers the difficulty of developing space
applications while putting the resources
like infrastructure to best use. Additionally,
SpaceChain OS deployed sandbox
technology ensures an interference-free
environment for the applications.

Responsibilities

-Link SpaceChain system to the
other communication system

Description

Using Blockchain technology to realize a decentralized
cloud service

Make the SpaceChain system a whole network and to be
an interface be-tween other network system, like cellule
network/cable network etc.

Our introduction of SpaceChain OS powered smart satellite system
will lower application costs. Upon the success of in-orbit testing,
SpaceChain Foundation will launch several customized LEO
satellites with their partners that are equipped with communication,
camera, sensor, gesture and orbit control functions. Please

refer to “SpaceChain Satellite Whitepaper” for more details. By
launching these low-orbit satellites, a simple network is formed to
provide developers the platform needed to start creating software.
Establishing standards for smart satellite hardware and achieving
standardized production of satellite parts will make greatly reduce
the cost of producing a satellite and spur organic growth of the
industry. This will ensure an economically viable ecosystem.

To simplify the development process, there will be a development
SDK for SpaceChain OS. It provides a modular development
environment that is similar to Java Script. By being fully open-
sourced, more people will join the community and create a vibrant
development community.

There will be tutorials for software development, and space
hardware developer board for people to try out developing
application for satellites.

Page 20 | SpaceChain White Paper V 1.0 3,

Partnerships with well-known universities through lab establishment, research, open courses, technical forums
and other educational resources. SpaceChain Foundation will provide free resources for universities to take part
in this exciting journey by providing free developer boards, hosting hackathons, and community development on
SpaceChain OS globally.

SpaceChain Foundation wishes to establish an eco-system where every contributor is fairly rewarded. Through such
an economic model, more resources will be attracted into the space industry and more people will join the grand
adventure of space exploration.

SylixOS is an open source RTOS (Real-Time Operating System) project. SylixOS has been applied widely in
various fields such as defense and security, aeronautics and astronautics, high speed railway system, smart grid,
industrial automation, and motion control etc.

In the SpaceChain project, SylixOS is used in the satellite platform to manage hardware resources and in the
Blockchain payload to provide standard API interface and various system features for applications.

SPACE
CHAIN

Tokenomics and
Blockchain Structure
of SpaceChain

3.1 SpaceChain Bottom Layer: Qtum

The SpaceChain OS framework is divided into a Blockchain application layer that
includes these layers:

* Mainly Qtum provides the basic service API for smart contract and block chain
application;
* Qtum also offers a sandbox to guarantee the safety of applications processing;
* Compatible for Ethereum protocol (ETH) ereum EVM to process Qtum
smart contract;
* Open for any public blockchain and their smart contract application ;

SpaceChain requires a blockchain technology with low power consumption, high
stability, and strong expansibility. Qtum uses a PoS (proof-of-stake) consensus
mechanism whereas most other blockchain technologies widely use PoW (proof-
of-work) such as the Bitcoin blockchain and Ethereum protocol. PoW has high
requirements for energy and hardware resources to work well so it is not suitable
for satellite systems. Qtum has fully absorbed the accumulation of both the Bitcoin
blockchain and the Ethereum protocol. Thus, Qtum technology has advantages

in areas from code stability to third party support. In addition, Qtum uses UTXO
technology to increase the network expansibility so that it can support a simple
payment protocol SPV and the Lightning Network, and fully support the EVM smart
contracts as well. So Qtum meets all the demands need to fully run blockchain
technology on satellites. SpaceChain chose Quantum Chain Technology (Qtum) from
the beginning after doing a complete technical assessment of both hardware and
software necessary for space technology development.

In addition to the above reasons, Qtum has many unique innovations. Qtum is

the first smart contract platform based on UTXO and MPoS. It has pioneered the
integration of the advantages of both BTC and ETH ecosystem. It has proposed and
implemented the following core technology innovation:

* Qtum uses efficient and secure MPoS consensus. As compared to Proof-of-
Work(PoW) that is widely adopted by other blockchain technologies, MPoS
consumes less energy and has no requirements of high-end hardwares. MPoS
allows any coin holder to be able to mine the coin without wasting much
electricity by staking them in the wallet. More importantly, MPoS can provide a
more secure consensus and subsequently raising the cost of cyber attacking, by
adjusting the height of block rewards and the allocation of transaction fees.
Page 22 | SpaceChain White Paper V 1.0 x

SPACE
CHAIN

* Qtum combines the strengths of both Bitcoin and Ethereum, making it more stable in terms of
code structure. In addition, its adaptability towards third-party applications gives it extra edge
over other blockchain technologies.

* Qtum extends the UTXO technology of Bitcoin, and enhances the scalability of its network. It
supports technologies such as Simple Payment Verification (SPV) and Lightning Network, as well
as smart contracts that utilizes EVM virtual machines. Qtum designed and implemented Account
Abstract Layer (AAL) technology, realizes conversion of UTXO model and EVM smart contract
account model. Then developers can use EVM to develop smart contract without paying too
much attention to the details of conversion of UTXO model.

* Qtum invented Decentralized Governance Protocol (DGP). Through the smart contract embedded in
the genesis block, DGP is able to govern the blockchain network and achieve autonomous
distributed processing. This allows for faster updating of the network. The current changeable
parameters that Qtum supports include: Block size,Gas limite,Gas dispatch and lowest Gas price.

* Qtum is currently researching on high-performance virtual machine of new infrastructure. The
innovative X86 virtual machine will tackle some problems existing in Ethereum EVM, for
example, the lack of support for standard libraries and floating points, byte code of excessive size
etc. Also, it will focus on building an efficient smart contract system built upon the UTXO model.

Qtum is an open source project, see https://Qtum .org for more information.

Qtum SpaceChain System library layer includes:
* Open source software library support, including basic library libboost, libdb, libsnappy, libcyrpto+, etc.

+ Library provides services to the blockchain application layer through standard interfaces such as
Posix and BSD sockets;
* System library software is all open source project.

* Operating system layer includes:

* Standard interface support such as POSIX/BSD Socket/IO
* SylixOS kernel

+ Hardware driver.
Page 23 | SpaceChain White Paper V 1.0 3,

3.2 SpaceChain Application Layer: Possibilities of Distributed Application (Dapp)

The SpaceChain application layer presents many blockchain use cases. For example, a
cloud computing app use case is backup nodes for data recovery for the most important
encrypted data. The encryption and cryptography is performed on the satellite itself. In
this case, the satellite is a first class actor where the satellite decrypts data payload. This
makes the data extremely secure.

In a “trusted execution environment,” we provide software code and data that we digitally
sign here on earth and upload to the satellite. The satellite checks digital signatures before
adding anything in the application sandbox before executing the program. This system
provides authentication and blockchain capability. For developers and businesses this
allows a “fail-fast” make-a-change-and-try-again approach or rapid iteration in contrast to
the old world approach of launching a satellite per app.

We are part of the NewSpace trend of commercialization of space. In the old world model
there were only large governments deploying big satellites in space and big rockets
costing billions of dollars to build, government-led and government-funded, with very little
opportunity for private space companies to form to offer these services at a competitive
cost. In the new model, led in part by China, we have a new space race where commercial
companies from China, US, Russia, EU are competing to commercialize low earth orbit
and driving the development of space technology. This is creating new markets and

brings new funding into the space industry, creating possibilities for new economic models
instead of one dominated by few owners and few operators. Decentralization keeps power
distributed and access open for everyone.

3.3 How the SpaceChain Token Works on SpaceChain OS

In the SpaceChain economic model, the token will connect to our SpaceChain OS and allow developers

to upload apps onto the SpaceChain network and thus store data and execute programs on SpaceChain
satellites. SpaceChain tokens must be bought in order to execute these SpaceChain apps much like a ticket to
use a SpaceChain app for a duration of time or store one megabyte on a satellite.

We are essentially building a market for space applications where a token will be a way for apps to be priced.
For example, if one app is more popular than another then there will be more demand for that specific space
application and thus more tokens used.

This new economic model is what led us to evolve a space app model within a broad vision of developing an
inner space application and communication network first. In the private space agency model where we wire
the solar system for networking, after many years and many networks, we will see satellite constellations
around the moon, as well as remote data centers around planets and other celestial bodies. These
constellations will communicate with each other and form a backup. This will enable human and robotic
settlement of space in the long-term.

This mission to wire the solar system for networking will help realise a model called the Pony Network in Space.
The Pony Network is an economic model in space for payloads and propellant technology systems whereby
people and cargo travel to the moon and mars quickly and cheaply by taking a point-to-point transit approach
over shorter distances. For example, a satellite being launched to the moon will not travel on a single a rocket
going all the way to the moon, instead it will be launched to low earth orbit and transfer to another vehicle, using
software on satellites along its path rather than having every single application running on its system. The entire
network will be powered by and built on this token economic model.
Page 24 | SpaceChain White Paper V 1.0 |

3.4 Community Evolution of Collaboration in Space Exploration

Spacechain is based on a whole-of-mankind space exploration paradigm. The vision of
Spacechain is to find a mechanism in the field of space exploration that can effectively mobilize the
power of all mankind to meet this challenge in the face of great challenges.

SpaceChain tries to solve the following three problems:

1.International space cooperation is relatively closed and there is an urgent need in the
aeronautical field for a space cooperation alliance that is open and democratic.

2.The aerospace industry is currently closed to the public, and space exploration does not
harness the strength of all fields.

3.The current space project has not found a balance between government and commercial
enterprise.

At present, international space cooperation is relatively closed. The reason is that security is the
biggest barrier to cooperation among most countries. The other is the question of interests, which is
the tension between commercial companies and state-owned companies. Therefore, establishing a
cross-border, safe space security alliance that can protect the interests of participants in the field of
aerospace will be the key to promoting deep cooperation in the field of space.

To establish this alliance, a collaborative mechanism must be established with other companies
and blockchains. The mission of SpaceChain is to break through the existing internal barriers of
the world aerospace industry by establishing such collaborative mechanisms and give us full play
to existing capabilities and enable optimal integration of available resources. SpaceChain aims to
reach a consensus on security and common interests.

For this purpose, SpaceChain developed SpaceChain OS, an operating system designed to create
a true network in space. SpaceChain OS uses blockchain technology to encrypt the transmitted
information to ensure the absolute security of information transmission, and the use of blockchain
technology in the operating system and sandbox management so that each satellite can run safely.

While achieving its security, SpaceChain OS hardware adaptability is enhanced to meet the
different needs of different spacecraft. Efforts are being made to promote its compatibility with
different spacecraft such as satellite systems, communications, navigation and remote sensing,
satellite ground systems, space stations, spacecraft, space probes and other applications, in order
to achieve a seamless network.

In addition to international cooperation, the aerospace industry should not remain closed to the
general public. Aerospace has always been a mysterious and opaque industry with a high barrier
to entry because of its small market, high cost, and small number of qualified personnel. However,
as we said before, the move towards space is a whole-of-mankind endeavour. It cannot be
accomplished solely in the aerospace industry and requires widespread collaboration.

There is a need to explore a model that will allow more people and more companies in other
industries take part in human space exploration. Today, the 5G era in mobile data has brought
about a thriving development in the satellite communications industry. The aerospace market has
been growing. The mission of the SpaceChain Foundation is to solve the remaining two problems
of high cost and limited qualified personnel so that more people can by part of a global endeavor
to explore space.
Page 25 | SpaceChain White Paper V 1.0

Data and research show that the effective way
to reduce the cost of satellite applications is

to increase the number of applications of a
satellite. Just as a mobile phone has changed
from a smartphone like Nokia to a smart
phone today, the shift is based on a strong
and stable operating system.

+ SpaceChain OS is the operating system
that can solve this problem. Developers
can develop satellite applications
based on the software development
environment provided by SpaceChain
OS and upload the program code to the
satellite via terrestrial data transfer
stations in a manner that is extremely
simple and extremely efficient to develop.

+ SpaceChain OS can therefore
greatly reduce the cost of space
applications. Reducing access barriers
in the aerospace field and upgrading the
average airspace technology are the
most important ways to solve the
problem of imited space personnel.

* SpaceChain OS reduces the barriers
to use and simplifies the use of space.
At the same time, the Foundation
of Space-Chain Trust will popularize
the foundation of aerospace
technology in higher education and
increase the potential talent pool
pursuing a space exploration career.

On the basis of the collaboration mechanism, if the journey of
mankind to explore space is to be sustained and the cognitive
boundary of mankind to expand continuously, we must stimulate the
power of a free society. This requires a more open and cooperative
commercial space socio-economic and technological development
model. Most current space projects cover both the government and
the commercial sectors. The funds and policies of the government-
led space project will be guaranteed, but at the same time they will
be constrained by the government budget and government efficiency
and may be hijacked by powerful interest groups.

In contrast, purely commercial space projects focus on economics,

but regrettably, it is very difficult for space projects to make profits in
space using conventional models. Therefore, the issue of broad-based
participation in the construction of space projects needs to be solved.

The mission of the SpaceChain is to solve the above problems,
establish a socio-economic model and explore a strong collaborative
and win-win model in the aerospace field that can support a global
collaborative and sustainable commercial space program.

The new commercial space model is already being realized

by billionaires who invested in mega-rocket and orbit giant
constellations to colonise space and its potential. The SpaceChain
Foundation hopes to use the community incentive model to establish
the ecological chain, production chain and distribution chain of
aerospace wealth, so that every participant and contributor will get a
fair return and attract more resources to participate in the aerospace.
We aim to partner with organizations pursuing this same approach.
We will build, participate in the exploration of human space, and
extend human cognitive boundaries indefinitely.

SpaceChain White Paper V 1.0

3.5 SpaceChain Ecosystem Build-up

Blockchain enables new open economic models that enable
new businesses, and especially for the first time ever, new
space based business.

SpaceChain is similar to mobile app store you can pay a small
amount of money and access a space app. This system is much
cheaper than ten years ago when you needed to buy and operate
an entire satellite. Now a few cryptocurrencies units can develop
and put an app on a satellite; this enables whole new markets that
were not possible before.

Before blockchain and cryptocurrencies, there was a large

capital cost of operating a large satellite. SpaceChain already
has deployed an app platform based in space, fully tested, and
will be launching satellites in 2018 to achieve the base layer

of anew structure. Because the SpaceChain system cost is
100x of investment versus 1000x compared to the old satellite
launch mode, the economics enables many new use cases. The
most important use case are the ones we have not thought of.
Comparing the Internet’s earliest iteration, few of us could predict
global apps that would given everyone multiple choices to share a
car. Opening app stores and the creativity of developers allowed
ride share to begin as a viable business model that disrupted
transportation. Today, we question if anyone will ever own a car in
the future, solely for personal use. SpaceChain will allow this new
creativity for use cases that we have no ability to predict.

Another opportunity is the ability to bring a Linux software model
to space. Imagine a physically untouchable data center in space
with a higher level of security because the data centre cannot
be accessed without very high cost. Physical remoteness is
attractive to security-conscious customers. With a non-terrestrial
network we have a better diversity of nodes like Internet nodes,

3.6 incubator & Commercial Opportunities

blockchain nodes and other application
nodes. Remote nodes operating in

space give us network redundancy,
satellite backup, and autonomy of data
and software. Autonomous software

and software automation will allow us to
communicate with sensors operating in the
ocean engaging climate change research,
among other smart contracts. Satellites will
be Internet repeaters, remote sensors for
telecommunications, while communicating
with and tracking planes and ships around
the globe, all powered on blockchain.

In 2016, the satellite industry generated
more than $260 billion in revenues according
to an annual report by the Satellite Industry
Association (SIA). This was a 2% growth
compared to 3% in 2015. Imagine the
growth when this wealth can be redistributed
to developers on a mesh network of a
constellation of satellites. There are currently
only 6 companies the “large satellites” and 16
in the “small satellite” observation categories.
With SpaceChain OS, satellite capabilities
will be increased and this sector will flourish
alongside communication, data storage
and collection capabilities, with many new
companies and partnerships. In less than
a few years, the numbers will be totally
different with the revolutionary capabilities
of SpaceChain’s potential in expanding
commercial interests.

The Spacechain Foundation will also launch an open source hardware development board and a development
tutorial that runs SpaceChain OS, and promote it freely in colleges and universities all over the world to increase
the number of space personnel produced by the education sector. The increase of the number of talents will greatly
enhance the vitality of the industry and provide a continuous momentum of development for space exploration.

SpaceChain Foundation has been supporting startups in the space industry around the world:

* SpaceChain OSRZ Capital, an institutional investment firm.

* Beijing Jiu Zhou Yun Jian, astartup specialized in liquid rocket engine, is collaborating with SpaceChain on an

engine smart control system.
Page 27 | SpaceChain White Paper V 1.0 |

Summary

In short, SpaceChain aims to accomplish the following three goals:

1.break down barriers to cooperation and integrate the existing space
resources so that space can better serve the earth and serve humankind,

2.lower the industry access threshold and costs, vigorously develop education
and involve more people in space exploration,

3.establish a socio-economic model to support a sustainable commercial
space decentralized, distributed program that will continuously grow
knowledge and expand the cognitive boundaries of humanity.

The SpaceChain Foundation hopes to take on the responsibility of pushing
the boundaries of space and exploring the cosmos in which we live.
SpaceChain hopes to attract more talent and resources, pool the power of all
mankind, and join togEthereum protocoler in advancing space technology. We
believe that the wisdom of bringing togEthereum protocoler a large number

of talented people in a clear direction can lead to a unity of purpose in space
exploration and the ultimate goal of a thriving human civilization.

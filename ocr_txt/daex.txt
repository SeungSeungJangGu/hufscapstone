1. Background

1.1 The Cryptocurrency Market

The current total market value of all cryptocurrencies has far exceeded $280
billions. Among all of these cryptocurrencies, bitcoin stands out with over 50%
of the market share. At the same time, new cryptocurrencies keep pouring into
the market. Bitcoin derivatives are also entering the market. Regulated

exchanges like CBOE and CME followed each other in listing bitcoin futures.

Until the third quarter of 2017, investment return on cryptocurrencies is as high
as 448% which has far exceeded investment returns on other assets like the
stock market, gold and real estate. Cryptocurrency trading has been very active.
Almost 60 cryptocurrencies boast average daily trading volume of 10 millions
dollars. Such active trading leads more and more trading exchanges entering
the market.

1.2 Risks with Current Exchanges

There are currently two types of cryptocurrency trading exchanges, centralized
exchanges and distributed exchanges. Each type has its advantages and
disadvantages.

A distributed exchange is usually based on distributed ledger technology. It runs
on its own. It does not need people to maintain its operation. Trader’s asset on
a distributed exchange is held in his own account. The exchange does not have
access to it. Traders trade directly with each other on a distributed exchange.
The exchange’s underlying technology guarantees the trade go through, and
cleared and settled correctly. Such distributed exchanges include BitShare and
EtherDelta.

The advantages of distributed exchange are very obvious. Trader’s asset is well
protected; trading and clearing costs are low; traders can freely join and leave,
and they can trade with anyone in the world as long as the other party also uses
the same exchange. Despite of all these advantages, however, distributed
exchanges also have serious disadvantages, particularly in terms of liquidity,
matching speed and flexibility. Because of these disadvantages, distributed
exchanges never become widely used in cryptocurrency trading.

Centralized exchanges are exactly the opposite of distributed exchanges in
almost every aspect. It provides a centralized order matching mechanism for
traders. It receives trader’s cryptocurrencies as deposits, and holds these
cryptocurrencies in its own storage. The exchange then issues IOUs to trader’s
exchange account. Traders effectively trade these |OUs with each other at the
exchange. When they want to transfer their cryptocurrencies to other places,
they use their |OUs to instruct the exchange to send corresponding
cryptocurrencies to specified addresses.

While current cryptocurrency centralized exchanges have strong advantages in
providing liquidity, matching speed and flexibility, they are inherently flawed in
their current infrastructure. Each exchange maintains its customers’ assets. This
exposes customers’ assets to both serious internal and external risks. The
operation of such exchanges is also opaque. There is no way to guarantee an
exchange’s objectivity in being an unbiased matching mechanism. In fact,
security incidents keep happening to centralized exchanges in recent years,
from Mt.Gox to the most recent Yubit. Such incidents will for sure keep
happening because of the basically flawed infrastructure of centralized
exchanges.

1.3 The Goal of DAEX

The goal of DAEX is to provide a better infrastructure for the cryptocurrency
trading industry by taking the reasonable parts of the mainstream securities
trading industry and by taking advantages of new opportunities brought about
by the distributed ledger technology. Specifically, trading and clearing will be
separated into different entities. Current centralized exchanges will continue to
provide trading service. But the clearing work will be handled over to a common
clearing service which is based on the DAEX solution. But, different from
current centralized clearing services, the DAEX clearing service is based on
distributed ledger technology. The distributed ledger technology guarantees that
trades are correctly and safely cleared and settled. By using distributed ledger
technology, trader’s assets are kept in their own accounts on the blockchain. No
one else can access traders’ assets without their permissions. This effectively

removes trader’s asset risks in current centralized exchanges.

The DAEX solution will be an open sourced clearing service based on a public
blockchain. Its code is open for public inspection and supervision.

2. The DAEX Ecosystem

The rapid development of cryptocurrency trading calls for a more effective and
secure clearing service. After a series of hacker thefts and security incidents,
many exchanges have to come to the consensus that a common clearing and
asset custodian service is required to protect the market and to guarantee the
sustained growth of the market. DAEX is therefore the answer to this market
need.

2.1 The Ecosystem

DAEX ecosystem is composed of a clearing service that is based on distributed
ledger technology, centralized exchanges and user wallets. Traders use their
wallets to perform trades on exchanges. After trades are matched at
exchanges, exchanges send matched trades to the clearing service. The
clearing service CaaS is performed by smart contracts on the distributed ledger
technology. During the initial phase of DAEX, cryptocurrencies will be serviced.
During future phases of DAEX, cryptocurrency derivatives will be serviced. That

is, DAEX will provide clearing service for cryptocurrency derivatives traded on

The DAEX ecosystem provides the following advantages to participants in the
system:

Secure

Participating exchanges must meet the business and technology requirements
of the ecosystem, thus the quality of trading service is maintained. User’s
assets are all held on the blockchain. Assets cannot be moved without user’s
admission. Multiple-part private key further protect user’s assets and also a safe
recovery mechanism in case a user loses his private key. Smart contract and
the blockchain technology guarantees the correctness of clearing and
settlement.

Trust

Decoupling between trading and clearing is the best way to guarantee the
safety of customer trading assets. The insurance fund contributed by
participating exchanges provides another layer of safety. The DAEX ecosystem
therefore provides a trustworthy environment for exchanges and traders.

Open

First of all, the DAEX ecosystem is open to and welcome new exchanges.
Exchanges that participate in the DAEX ecosystem can use all products and
services provided by DAEX, including wallets and clearing. Secondly,
participating exchanges can expect to use more value added services DAEX is

going to provide, including cryptocurrency derivatives trading.

2.2 Participants

(1) The DAEX Foundation

The DAEX Foundation is registered in Singapore. Its mission is to develop the
DAEX solution and promote its use among cryptocurrency exchanges in the
world. The Foundation also manages the fund contributed by global investors.

The DAEX Foundation’s responsibilities include but are not limited to the

following:

‘Information revelation ‘Compliance and auditing
‘Fund management Strategic decisions
‘Arbitrage and reconciliation -Public relationship

(2) Wallet Users
Wallet users whose identity have been certified can use various functions such
as trading and asset delivery.

(3) Exchanges
Provide cryptocurrency and derivatives trading services for wallet users. Coun-
sel member of the clearing union. Provide a node on the clearing blockchain.

2.3 Value

The cryptocurrencies industry is still in its very early stage. Inevitably it has
many problems, just like the internet industry in its early stage. But, it has a
strong growth potential which is probably many times greater than that of the
internet industry. The goal of the DAEX ecosystem is to help the industry grow
in a more orderly and secure way by providing a solid infrastructure that
benefits many industry players.

(1) CaaS

Current cryptocurrency exchanges all clear their own trades. There are inherent
risks in this kind of infrastructure. Customers ‘digital assets on the exchange are
exposed to exchange’s internal and external risks. A trader’s trading capital also
cannot be fully utilized because he has to meet the capital requirements of
different exchanges. Also, since each exchange has to do its own clearing work,
the whole trading industry is not making good use of its resources.

The goal of DAEX is to provide CaaS for the cryptocurrency trading industry.
Since this CaaS is based on distributed ledger technology, its operation is thus
objective and transparent. It is not in favor of any type of organization, or a
specific organization, or any group of people. It is effectively an infrastructure
service to the whole industry. By using this service, the industry becomes
unbiased, objective and transparent, industry resources become more
effectively used. The industry is thus growing on a more solid foundation.

(2) More effective way to list digital assets

With the booming of ICO events, more and more cryptocurrencies are entering
the market everyday. Lots of them are either pure fraud schemes or low quality
coins that will never survive. At the same time, because of the low entry barriers
and the booming industry, more and more trading exchanges start to provide
cryptocurrency trading services. Selecting quality coins to list and make related
business and technology work ready become a very burden some work for

many exchanges.

As a clearing service, it is DAEX’s job to list new clearing products so that
participating exchanges can trade. The DAEX wallet can also simplify the work
exchanges and users start trading a new cryptocurrency. With DAEX’s services,
exchanges therefore can significantly expedite the new product listing work and
become more competitive in this rapidly growing industry.

(3) Help exchanges to become more competitive

Cryptocurrency exchanges nowadays offer the same service. Trading service is
more and more becoming a commodity. DAEX ecosystem offers participating
exchanges a new competitive advantage over competitors. First of all, the token
rewarding mechanism for everyone-clearing will attract more new users,
generate more frequent trades and more trading quantity. Secondly, the DAEX
multi-asset wallet lowers the delivering cost. Thirdly, the separation of trading
and clearing helps exchanges to focus more on their core competencies, thus
maintain their competitive advantages.

2.4 Comparison of Different Modes

The DAEX ecosystem is the best combination of centralized trading and
distributed clearing. DAEX users can enjoy the best trading experience provided
by centralized exchanges and also at the same time do not have to worry about
the safety of their trading assets. DAEX also significantly lowers the technical
and business entry barriers for aspiring exchanges, providing a solid foundation
for their business growth.

2.5 Future Development

(1) Clearing for margin trading and short

Margin trading is a trading method when a user borrows money to establish
long positions on certain cryptocurrency. Short is a trading method when a user
borrows certain cryptocurrency to establish a short position. In both methods,
the trader hopes that the market will move in the expected direction, then he

can make a profit and return borrowed money or cryptocurrency.

During the first development phase of DAEX, the clearing service for
cryptocurrency trading will be developed. During the second phase, clearing
service for margin trading and short will be developed.

(2) Derivatives clearing

Because of the tremendous profit potential of cryptocurrencies, exchanges are
going to provide more financial instruments for their customers to trade or
hedge. Cryptocurrency derivatives such as futures and options will be provided
to hedge or speculate. CBOE and CME have already introduced bitcoin futures.
It is expected that derivatives based on other cryptocurrencies will be gradually
introduced.

Although the introduction of bitcoin futures met the market demand in a timely
manner, it however has some serious drawbacks. The most obvious one is that
both future products are cash settled, not with the underlying asset. Traders still
cannot use bitcoin derivatives to obtain bitcoins.

DAEX will address this issue by supporting the underlying asset delivery in
cryptocurrency derivatives trading. Also, by using smart contract technology,
DAEX will use trader’s digital assets on the blockchain as collaterals, raising
trader’s capital efficiency and controlling risk at the same time.

The DAEX clearing solution also offers the following advantages:

* The distributed ledger technology guarantees the objectivity of the clearing

process and protect the safety of customers’ assets.

* The settlement price is based on a composite price of the underlying asset of
participating exchanges. The blockchain technology guarantees the authenticity
of these prices. The weighted price also guarantees the objectivity of the
settlement price.

(3) Smart inclusive financing

The blockchain technology creates a brand new form of asset. This new asset
form, which we call smart digital asset, is represented by bits and bytes in
computer code and programs, registered on the blockchain, exchanged from
account to account, and can run automatically without human participation. With
this smart digital asset, we can create all kinds of assets defined by the current
legal framework, from tangible assets such as car and real estate to intangible
assets like stock, savings and intellectual properties.

The essence of smart digital asset is the control of asset ownership. The DAEX
system gives every user the right to issue smart digital asset using DAEX
tokens. A user can create new smart digital asset such as commercial paper
and personalized asset by collateralizing certain highly liquid digital assets. After
it is recognized by certain users and exchanges in the DAEX ecosystem, it then
can be traded among approving users and exchanges, and cleared by the
DAEX clearing chain objectively and transparently.

3. The Clearing Solution

3.1 The Clearing Chain

The clearing chain is the core of the DAEX clearing ecosystem. It is an open
sourced cryptocurrency clearing solution based on distributed ledger
technology. It provides clearing and settlement services to both individual and
institution users. This chain is deployed on multiple nodes on a public cloud. It

uses one kind of POS consensus mechanism to validate transactions.

3.1.1 Clearing Contract

A clearing smart contract that is based on the smart contract technology plays a
pivotal role in this clearing service. All clearing and settlement business rules
are preprogrammed into this clearing contract. This smart contract finishes the
whole clearing and settlement cycle of a matched trade.

After a matched trade is formed in a DAEX participating exchange, it is sent to
the clearing chain. A clearing smart contract is then formed for this matched
trade. This clearing smart contract will first validate the matched trade to make
sure that it meets all the business requirements. After the validation, the smart
contract goes through the consensus mechanism and then updates
corresponding accounts on the ledger.

3.1.2 The Clearing Mechanism

DAEX customizes a specialized consensus mechanism based on clearing value
factor (CVF-POS). It is a governance standard of distributed digital clearing
ledger, its purpose is to prevent the malicious sabotage behaviors through strict

clearing responsibility arrangements.

The high performance of CVF-POS will avoid the centralization of computing
power and clearing power through technology democratization, expanding
network effect with relatively low network cost, reaching relative
decentralization. Every wallet user with digital asset can participate in the
clearing process, becoming witness of clearing. “Everyone participate” clearing
mechanism provides an effective way for DAEX wallet users to obtain real
financial reward. At the same time, the clearing responsibility mechanism can
identify a process that leads to mistakes in consensus, and perform

punishments according clearing rules.

In the classic POS mechanism, the weight of every node is linked to the capital
on this node. This can lead to Matthew Effect which makes the rich richer. In the
DAEX clearing ecosystem, every DAEX wallet user has equal accounting power
but different accounting scores. The accounting power is determined by the
ecosystem, it acquires specific number of accounting scores through value
factor evaluation and exchange. Those nodes with a certain number of
accounting scores can be defined as a validator. Validator on the clearing chain
is similar to miner. Wallet users can select a validator to delegate their
accounting scores. Validator is a safe machine that is delegated responsibility to
generate blocks, carrying out accounting and consensuses through
broadcasting encrypted signatures.
DAEX BLOCKCHAIN

SOLUTION BASED ON DISTRIBUTED
LEDGER TECHNOLOGY

v0.9.8

DAEX token is like chips on the clearing chain. Users are responsible for
selecting trustworthy validators. The clearing union will keep raising validators’
judging ability and the also binding power of the ecosystem in order to protect
user’s benefits. When wallet users trust their DAEX tokens to any validator to
earn some DAEX token rewards, if the validator is hacked or it violates any
agreements, then the collateralized tokens will be penalized. The CVF-POS
provable security mechanism and the collateralized assets of concerned parties
provide node and even light clients measurable security. The administration
system of the clearing chain can solve temporary trading exchange problems.
For example, when detecting malicious attacks, it can suspend clearing
requests. DAEX can support enough number of validators to achieve global
distributed blockchain, and also within a very short period of time. With the
development of bandwidth, storage and parallel computing, the DAEX clearing

chain can support the scale of more validators.

The accounting power in the DAEX ecosystem is determined in the early stage,
including accounting range and ecosystem parameters. But, with the
development of the ecosystem, users can propose to make amendments to
change ecosystem parameters. Users can also propose to make amendments
to ecosystem rules. These rules bind related parties together to solve asset
theft and contract loophole problems, reaching better and clearer solutions.

Since all DAEX participating exchanges use one clearing ledger, customer
accounts are created and managed on the same ledger. Customers’ trading
assets are also managed on the same ledger. The same underlying technology
and clearing rules significantly reduces exchanges’ costs and errors. The
technology as well as the business rules DAEX uses are open and transparent
to exchanges and traders, DAEX thus provides them with a reliable and

trustworthy clearing and settlement service.

The DAEX clearing chain will accommodate the existing infrastructure of
exchanges. Adapters that make sure the matched trade meets the DAEX
clearing protocol will be provided to exchanges to facilitate their adoption of
DAEX service. End users can use wallets that meet DAEX specification to
access and manage their trading assets on the clearing chain.

The DAEX clearing service is different from existing clearing services. Its
service is accessible to all regions of the world and it is not regulated by any
regulation body in the world. It relies only on the distributed ledger technology to
guarantee an objective and correct clearing service. This nature makes it more

appealing to cryptocurrency traders and exchanges in the world.

3.2 Clearing Protocol

In the DAEX ecosystem, business standards and protocols such as clearing
protocol, data structure, and encryption standard are made collectively and
implemented by technology. The clearing protocol specifies the communication
mechanism between exchanges and the DAEX clearing service. It is a critical
element of the DAEX ecosystem.

The clearing protocol uses lightweight stateless remote communication
mechanism. The protocol may be in the form of the following examples.

Data structure of clearing request

Version Version number of the protocol
Channel Channel specification

Requester Requester’s ID

Header

Timestamp Request timestamp

Business ID Message ID to identify one clearing process
Module Clearing chain service element: exchange or wallet

To protect the security of sensitive message on the public network and user’s
clearing autonomy, transmitted messages use smart contract as carrying body.
Messages contain elements such as signature of public keys, address of smart
contracts, clearing message, random number and signature. The clearing
message is a binary string specified in the form of the above protocol and the
signature is the ECDSA result through calculating the clearing message through
hash calculation.

3.3 The Atomic Settlement

The clearing chain supports multiple assets. These assets can be transferred
between different chains via IBAS (Inter Blockchain Assets Settlement)
protocols. Based on the clearing chain, the atomic settlement supports the
settlement of asset transactions between different chains. Using the atomic
settlement, DAEX wallet users can safely and directly transact different types of
digital assets, the underlying clearing chain perform all the necessary work such
as encrypting and consensus reaching. The atomic settlement on the clearing
chain solves the current digital asset isolated islands situation, making digital
asset exchanges safe and convenient.

The internal network of IBAS will speed up the final confirmation speed without
compromising integrity. To guarantee the synchronization of transmission of
digital asset packets among different blockchains, the clearing request party
needs to publish a proof on the clearing chain, showing that it has issued a
trustable IBAS request.

The clearing chain validates this proof and produce a send/request data packet
with consistent block header. This mechanism needs to insert a clearing chain
based connector between different asset chains. The connector confirms

clearing operations by proving the existence of assets sent from related chains.

3.4 The DAEX Wallet

The DAEX wallet is the client system of the clearing chain. It is an unmanaged
and distributed wallet that supports multiple types of cryptocurrencies. It has the
following characteristics:

* Multiple-part private key: Uses three parts private key. Needs any two parts to
be used together to access assets in the wallet;

* Private key can be restored: A private key can be restored if a user loses his
part of the private key;

* Complete autonomy: User has full autonomy over digital assets in his own wallet.

After a user goes through a KYC process and become registered on the
clearing chain, a unique public address on the clearing chain will be assigned to
him. His trading digital assets will be managed in this address. He uses digital
assets in this address to trade in all participating exchanges. At the time this
DAEX wallet is produced, a three-part private key also generated. These three
parts are kept at different places to provide a safe and recoverable mechanism

for private key management.

¢ User part: Stored on user’s mobile client. It is not stored in a readable format,
and cannot be copied or exported. It is usually kept in a cold wallet state. It only

finishes level one signature when user moves assets in the wallet.

+ Wallet part: It is stored in hot wallet mode on DAEX servers in the internal
network separated by DMZ zone. It supports level two signature on top of user’s
level one signature.

* Backup part: Stored on the clearing chain in the cold state. It does not

participate in any transaction. It is only used for recovery purpose.

4. The Usage of Token

The DAEX ecosystem uses token DAX to facility the cooperation among
different parts in the system. The DAEX Foundation issues DAX to raise fund
for the development of the DAEX solution. The fund raising plan and the usage
of DAX is stated below.

4.2 Usage of the Fund

Fund and cryptocurrencies received from private and community donations will
be managed by the DAEX Foundation in accordance with open and transparent
principles. The usage of fund can be traced and audited, and will be periodically
publicized to the community through multiple social media. The fund will be
used in, but not limited to, the following fields: operation of the foundation,
development of product and technology, community building, reward for the
clearing ecosystem, team building, global strategy development, sales and
marketing, asset custodian, and other specialized expenses.

4.3 Value Factor

In the DAEX ecosystem, every asset owner can create digital assets based on
DAEX tokens. These digital assets should meet current legal requirements.
Such assets may be tangible assets or intangible assets such as commercial
paper and customized assets.

With the development of the DAEX ecosystem, the types and quantities of
digital assets registered on the clearing chain will grow rapidly. But people’s
ability to estimate the value of smart digital assets on the clearing chain is still at
an early stage, users and exchanges in the ecosystem need a tool to reach a
consensus on the value of these assets so that these assets can be traded

freely.

To help members of the ecosystem, we introduce factors in the following five
dimensions to evaluate user clearing ability and smart asset value:

* Clearing Value: Measure user’s clearing contribution by calculating user’s
accumulated clearing contract numbers and total clearing quantities within the
most recent sliding time window;

* Capital Value: Calculate user’s total digital asset value in the clearing
ecosystem based on factors like ranking, market value, circulating ratio, and
daily transaction volume;

¢ Transaction Value: Calculate transaction values based on the scientific
combination of periodic peaks and clearing time, trade components, trade
channels, and other factors;

* Active Value: Based on user’s clearing participation time, trade influence
ability, and new customers developed as well as other factors to form a clearing
activeness profile.

+ Identity Value: Calculate the clearing identity levels based on user’s
participation in the exchange’s business range, debt ratio of digital assets, DAX
coin age, etc.

4.4 Token Reward Plan

When the DAEX solution is in production, those original ERC20 tokens will be
repurchased and destroyed. The clearing chain’s new native tokens will be
issued with a 1 to 1 ratio. The remaining DAEX tokens will be distributed to
reward virtual computing power’s contribution to clearing booking. The main
clearing booking will be performed by the full nodes of the clearing chain, which
include DAEX public nodes, exchange nodes, and super nodes. The difficulty
level of all these nodes are the same, but their respective numbers are
controlled in proportion in order to protect individual user’s income rights.

¢ DAEX public nodes

Public nodes deployed on the DAEX public chain. They provide the
infrastructure to maintain the stable operation of the clearing chain, and also the
virtual computing power for “everyone clears” of DAEX wallet users, lowering
the resource cost of individual’s participation, and raising clearing efficiency at
the same time.

¢ Exchange nodes

Nodes deployed at participating exchanges. It is one source of exchange’s
income. The number of nodes deployed at one exchange is correlated with its
clearing contribution, and an upper limit is specified.
DAEX BLOCKCHAIN

¢ Super nodes

when the clearing power of individual DAEX wallet user reaches certain level,
this individual can apply to become a super node. Different grade will be
assigned to this node depending on the “the effective time DAEX holding’.
Higher grade can obtain more reward income.

4.5 Incentive for Users

DAEX tokens will be rewarded to those who make contributions to the clearing
work in the DAEX ecosystem.

(1) Reward for witnessing clearing
Wallet users can delegate accounting scores to DAEX public nodes so as to get
reward for witnessing clearing. There are two preconditions for winning this

reward:
@® Holding DAX and with a clearing energy greater than zero;

@) Link wallet to a public node so as to make accounting contribution.

(2) Reward for user participation
The participation of users is the foundation of this ecosystem and is also the
demonstration of its value. User participation will be rewarded in the following ways:

¢ Opening an account and invitation to open an account

Opening an account or invitation to open an account will be rewarded with
DAEX tokens. The total opening accounts award will gradually decrease after
DAEX is online. The total invitation award will decrease with increasing number
of invited people.

¢ Effective clearing and settlement
Users will be rewarded with DAEX tokens when they use clearing and
settlement services through trading or delivery.

4.6 Token Usage Scenarios

DAX can be used in the following scenarios:
* Clearing fee « Exchange trade matching fee
* Settlement fee * Derivatives clearing fee

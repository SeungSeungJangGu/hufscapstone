BHP (Blockchain of Hash Power) is a distributed payment
system based on Bitcoin hash power credit. It uses Bitcoin hash
power as the underlying asset and takes 21 decentralized hyper
nodes as the community accounting consensus nodes. The system
is focusing on providing users with fast, convenient and highly
reliable digital currency payment and asset management services
based on smart contracts with blockchain technology. At the same
time, all BHP holders automatically receive dividends from Bitcoin
hash power assets.

1. Distribution Mechanism

The original COIN of public chain—BHP Coin, is the ecological
equity token of the BHP public chain, which is similar to the equity
certificate. The total amount of BHP Coin is 100 million, and the
minimum unit is 0.00000001. The issuance quota of BHP: 55% is
mined by PoS and 45% is directly generated in the genesis block.

Among the directly generated 45 million BHPs:

25 million BHPs are used to exchange the circulated BHPC
ERC20 tokens legally held by early users of the BHP community.
The exchange rate is 1:1.

10 million BHPs are held by technical team and genesis
node for medium and long-term incentives. They will be locked
with a smart contract at the early stage. When the hash power
of BHP reaches 5000P or the public chain runs for 18 months,
3 million BHPs will be released. 3 million BHPs will be released
after 7000P or the public chain runs for 24 months. 4 million
BHPs will be released after 10000P or 36 months, and the
distribution proposal will be decided by the founding team.

10 million will be released conditionally with different
incentive rules to 20 independent hyper nodes operation teams
as medium-term and long-term incentives. The release
mechanism is similar to genesis node. The BHP Foundation
determines the unlock mechanism and distribution proposal,
and makes it public to the community.

PoS mining of BHP public chain is an income distribution
mechanism based on the number of credible hash power (T)
and time (days) held by the user. The PoS mining revenue is
positively correlated with the trustworthiness and holding time
of the hash power holding. The specific mechanism is as
follows:

(1) Mining rules:

Source of income: The user's PoS mining revenue can
only be distributed from the PoS mining revenue pool
produced by the BHP Hash power chain block.

@) Distribution time: PoS mining revenues is distributed by
the day.

@®Distribution Limit: If the PoS mining revenue pool is
insufficient to allocate all user revenues for the day, it is
allocated based on the proportion of the user's earnings to the
total amount required for the day.

@Mining Ending: Mining will not be terminated until 55
million BHPs have been all generated and distributed.

(2) After paying the miner's PoS mining revenue, the remaining
BHPs will be used to motivate hash power promoters. The
specific incentive strategy will be determined by the BHP
Foundation.

(3) Credible hash power: The users may use the legal currency
or equivalent digital currency leasing hash power at the BHP
genesis node and the hyper node mine, which is called holding
credible hash power.

(4) Age of hash power Hrp= the number of credible hash power
(T) x holding time (days) in units of (7-days). For example, if an
user rents 10T credible hash power for a total of 100 days,
then the age of hash power is 1000 (7-days).

(5) Admission rules: When the user has a hash power age of
more than 1000 (7-days), he is eligible to get the BHP revenue

and bitcoins. In addition to the PoW mining revenue (BTC), the
new rental power can also obtain PoS mining revenue (BHP).
The newest rental power of BHP will not be included in
historical credible hash power.

(6) Hash power age equity coefficient Cro: The greater user’s
age, Hrp, the greater equity, and the more the PoS mining BHP
gains. The age-based equity coefficient Cro is a factor used to
adjust the income. The formula is as follows:

Crp = 1S ap ro Hos) Fp; S Hyp < Ap,

a7, -#,,,, 10 Hom) yp ry S Ay < Hyp;
0 Ap < Apr

In the early stage of hash power construction, the value of
the parameters in the current formula: H7p.74is equal to 1000
(T-days), Htp1, Hrp2 and Hrp3 are the 99th percentile, the 94th
percentile, and the 80nd percentile, respectively. With the
development of hash power construction, the four parameters
of Hrp.tH, Hro1, Hro2, and Hro3 will be adjusted by BHP
Foundation according to the situation of hash power ecological
construction, BHP total hash power, BTC total hash power,
BTC price, BHP price, POS mining output and other factors.
The adjustment plan will be announced on the official website
of BHP main chain.

The meaning of the p-th percentile is to calculate the
corresponding cumulative percentile after sorting all the users'
hash power ages from small to large. Then the value of the
data corresponding to a certain percentile is called its
percentile. It can be expressed as: the age of a group of n
users is sorted by value, and the value at p% is called the p-th
percentile. For example, the 99th percentile means that 99% of
users in the series are less than this value, and 1% of users in

#4 Th
the series are larger than this value. The C7p curve is shown in

Figure 1.

(7) Hash power age’s attenuation coefficient Carp: The user's
holding age H7p reduction causes a certain loss to the BHP
network hash power, and it will inevitably bring BTC income
loss to every BHP holder in the community. Cazp is a coefficient
to punish the revenue change when the user's hash power is
reduced. The age is reduced, the equity is reduced, and the
revenue of the PoS mining BHPC is reduced. Let the age of
the day be H7n.c, and historical maximum age (the age of the
day before reduction) is Hro.n, then the Hash power age’s day
change isHyrp = Hrp.c — Hrp.y. Hash power age’s attenuation
coefficient Carp formula:

When the user holds the age reduction, the age
attenuation coefficient Carp is the square of the ratio of the
current day to the historical maximum age.

(8) Monthly revenue rate of PoS mining Rw: related to the
holding age H7p. The segment value of Ru is determined by

#5 Hh
BHP Foundation based on the situation of hash power
ecological construction, the total hash power of bitcoin, mining
difficulty, bitcoin price, the total hash power of BHP and the
number of BHP outputs in the PoS mining revenue pool. It will
be published monthly on the official website of BHP main chain.
At the current stage, according to the dynamic change of the
user's age, when the age exceeds 1000 7-days, the range of
Ru is 2.5%~5%. The specific segmentation of monthly income
is as follows:

5% Hyp = Hyp
2.” Hyp < Hyp < Hyp
“13.5% Hyp; S$ Hyp < Hyp
2.5% Horm < Ay < Hyp,

In the formula, Hrp.7H, Hto1, Hro2 and H7p3 have the same
meaning as Crp expression.
(9) Daily PoS mining revenue Qsup:

@ In the early stage of hash power construction, when the
daily revenue of all users does not exceed the total daily
mining output, the daily PoS mining revenue of each user is as
follows:

N
Qoup = QO, x Crp x Cyr XR u % w Xo

=Q, x Kyp X me

Qr is the credible hash power held by users in BHP
genesis node and the hyper node mine. K7p is the hash power
age’s revenue coefficient, which is related to the age’s equity
coefficient, the age’s attenuation coefficient and the Monthly
revenue rate of PoS mining, Krp=Crp*Carp*Ry. Na is the
difficulty of PoS mining, which is determined by the BHP
Foundation according to factors such as total hash power of
BHP, the total amount of BHP output and hash power holding
cost, and it is published monthly on the official website of BHP

#6 Hh
main chain.

@) In the middle and later stages of hash power construction,
when the PoS mining revenue pool is insufficient to allocate
the revenue of all users on the day, that is, the sum of all user
income per day exceeds the total daily mining output, the daily
PoS mining revenue will be distributed proportionally according
to the following formula:

Ooup (1) = Opupr x KOO

DK (DO,

Kro(i) is the hash power age’s revenue coefficient of the
i-th user. Qr(i) is the credible hash power held by the i-th user
in BHP genesis node and the hyper node mine. Qesupr is the
daily total output of PoS mining. N is the total number of all the
users who have holden credible hash power and enjoyed the
equity of the revenue distribution.

(10) PoS mining revenue example: An user holds 10T credible
hash power at the BHP genesis node and hyper node mine,
and reaches 1000 (7:days) after 100 days. At this time, the
user’s hash power can not only gets the PoW mining revenue
(BTC), but also gains the PoS mining revenue (BHP).
Assuming the monthly rate of return Ru is 2.5%, According to
the BHP total hash power and its output, the difficulty of PoS
mining Na is 500. So the BHP revenue from the PoS mining on
that day is:

_ 10x1x1x0.025x 500

BHP 30

That is to say, the user can obtain 4.16 BHPs from PoS

mining on the day.

=4.16

3. BHP “Holding is mining” dividend

BHP& Renren mine users enjoy the dividend income of
“Holding is mining”.
The BHP public chain will take 2%~20% of the bitcoin

#7 Hh
output on the day of the BTC total holding hash power into the
BHP public chain dividend account every day. The dividend
rate is adjusted and announced monthly by Renren Mine
operating team according to the business situation, which is
currently 2%.

Users should deposit their BHP in the DAPP of Renren
Mine and enjoy the right to share the dividend. Through the
BHP public chain smart contract, all BTCs in the BTC reward
pool on that day are automatically allocated according to the
proportion of BHP coins held by users, and transferred to the
user account.

Mining Rules:

1) Source of income: A certain proportion of BTC mined
in Renren Mine is used as the daily BTC reward pool.

2) Distribution time: Earnings from coinage mining on
the previous day are distributed daily.

3) Distribution rule: According to the proportion of BHP

held by each user in the mine wallet, we distribute
every day. The BHP of locks does not participate in
the distribution of “Hold currency is mining’.

4. Macroeconomic Model of BHP

The value of BHP is closely related to BTC output,
dividend amount and market price of BTC.

BHP adopts the "bilateral income" economic model, which
is automatically priced by the market and avoids artificial
manipulation. When the number of miners in Renren Mine
increases, the rental hash power is more, the higher BTC is
mined, the more BTC reward pools can be allocated. The
number of BTCs mined by miners with BHP will increase on
the day they hold BHP, which will stimulate users to buy BHP in

#8 Th
the secondary market and drive the price of BHP to increase.

When the price of BTC rises, the mining income of miners with
BHP coin will increase.

Daily earnings of miners in Renren Mine = daily rental
hash power BTC earnings + daily rental hash power
double-digging BHP earnings + daily holding currency dividend
earnings of BHP. Among them, the dividend income of the day
= Daily distribution of BTC number / BHP participates in total
dividend distribution * the amount of BHP held by users. Users
can obtain BHP by renting hash power PoS mining, or they can
buy BHP in the secondary market and transfer it to DAPP in
Renren Mine to obtain the dividend income.

5. BHP Payment Application

Users can realize various ecological services in the chain
such as asset management, transfer transaction, settlement
and payment in DAPP (such as Renren Mine) supported by
BHP public chain. BHP hash power public chain only charges
a small fee according to the number of bytes packed in the
transaction to maintain the normal operation of the system.

The charging strategy of handling fee is to charge per 512
bytes. When transferring is finish, the verification node will
check the byte size of this transaction and calculate the
handling fee of this transaction.

Fee = transaction byte size / 512 + transaction byte size%
512) * 0.0001BHP

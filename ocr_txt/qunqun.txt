Background

1.1 Golden turning point of blockchain application

CryptokKitties, a virtual cat-breeding game built on the Ethereum blockchain,
was launched on Nov.28, 2017. In a few days, the world witnessed the
frenzied fashion of global blockchain digital cat-breeding. The sales volume
of CryptoKitties on open market is up to 75,371 units by the end of 22 p.m.,
Dec. 9, 2017 with sales of 24,911.62 Eth, amounting to US$11,739,500.33.
The average price of each Cryptokitty is 126.11 dollars. There is no doubt that
CryptokKitties has become a phenomenal decentralised application (DAPP) on

Ethereum.

The overnight success of CryptokKitties reflects the fact that the blockchain
industry is at the very beginning of qualitative change - digital currency has
experienced explosive growth in 2017, and the number of digital wallets has
increased to more than 20 million from less than 5 million at the beginning of
the year. At present, Coinbase has more than 2 million users. This
skyrocketing quantity of users drives up user demands, and the great
popularity of CryptoKitties has fully revealed the strong user demand. The
introduction of iPhone gave rise to the realisation that phones are not
designed for calling up only; similarly, the great popularity of CryptoKitties
allows people to understand that the blockchain industry is not just confined
to a means of payment, but represents a new infrastructure of Internet in the
future. The great popularity of CryptoKitties indicates that the blockchain
industry is starting to enter the “App Big Bang” era.

1.2 Social applications will be the real killer application of
blockchain
Social applications are the most basic and most important form of Internet

since the birth of Internet. According to the development history of mobile

8/46
© QUNQUN
internet from 2008 to 2017, the rise of mobile social applications including
Facebook, Twitter, WeChat, Instagram, etc., and these can be viewed as a real
turning point of the transition from traditional Internet to mobile Internet.
From then on, the activeness and realisation potential of mobile Internet grow

up ina manner of geometric jump.

With the explosive growth of digital currency users, such geometric growth
will reappear in blockchain world. The rise of active individuals will be
followed by social demands among users, thus digital currency users should

be equipped with their own communication platform.

Solution of QunQun Platform

In order to enrich the social applications of blockchain, on the one hand, the
threshold for the formulation and operation of blockchain applications should
be lowered; on the other hand, useful and product experiences which exceeds

expectations should be provided for social and community applications.

The first issue is that not everyone is capable of independently developing a
blockchain-based Internet community. The threshold to create and operate a
blockchain community is quite high. Therefore, a one-stop solution is
provided by the QunQun Platform for anyone to create a unique community
without any thresholds. Meanwhile, with the help of QUN Token Incentive
Mode, the operation threshold can be reduced effectively, with a short start-

up period.

In view of the application experience in blockchain, the solution provided by
the QunQun Platform comprises a bottom layer using a decentralised
blockchain accounting-book to record the ownership information of social
products, and deal with the transaction of social products by virtue of smart

contracts so that the ecosystem economy of community will be transparent

9/46
© QUNQUN
and clear; while the application layer shall make use of efficient centric
development architecture so as to fully guarantee the good performance of
all read and write operations as well as to effectively avoid the problems of
long confirmation duration, high cost and congestion-inducing, thus the
smooth and interactive experience of community products can be guaranteed
at the extreme.

QunQun Platform is conceptualized by the members from Qihoo 360 and the
original members from the founding team of Huajiao Live. The team is good

at creating Internet products which exceeds expectations.

Product scheme

3.1 What's QunQun Platform?

QunQun Platform is a blockchain-based incentive community platform (the
QunQun Platform). Users may create their own theme community on the
QunQun Platform without any coding or deployment. People can obtain QUN
incentives from QunQun incentive pool by operating their own community on
the QunQun Platform, or participating in the contributions of other

communities.

In order to promote the community ecosystem, a new community will be
generated every 6 minutes after the formal online opening of the QunQun
Platform, and anyone can create an initiatory community by paying to the
QunQun Platform a community platform toll in QUN (the initial price for such
toll would be 49.99 QUN). Each community has a unique door plate
(Keyword), which is convenient for the access and memory of community
members. The ownership of community will be recorded by blockchain
account book and cannot be tampered. Communities can be traded freely in

QunQun market.
© QUNQUN

3.2 Community form of QunQun

QunQun Platform provides an innovative Social Community. Like an
autonomous “Twitter”, each community is independent of each other.
Members in the community can perform dynamic releases, and follow each
other. All dynamic releases of members can be collected on the in-site public

Timeline channel.

In order to deal with the islanding effects of communities, and promote
content circulation and social development of the community on the QunQun
Platform, the QunQun Platform provides a unique cross-site interaction
mechanism by which users can stroll to other communities and “transfer”
anybody with an interest to the community, as well as synchronously read the

dynamic releases and perform interactions with the off-site Timeline channel.
3.3 App store of QunQun

The QunQun Platform will offer a community app store that would provide
abundant functions and entertainment applications for all communities. The
app store will be made available for third-party developers, who may develop
apps and sell them on the QunQun Platform, and receive QUN through the
revenue sharing model. All transaction will be recorded on blockchain

account book to ensure the open and transparent accounting.
3.4 Exchange market of QunQun community

Community managers will be able to obtain QUN daily by managing and
operating their own community. The value of a community would grow with
the increase in number of users. The QunQun Platform would also provide a
community exchange market. The key information of each community, such
as proof of activity, revenue information, number of users and activity of
users will be recorded on the public blockchain as evidence of the value

developed by each community. Communities with high activity will generally

11/46
© QUNQUN
fetch higher prices.

3.5 Product architecture of QunQun

Figure 1 business model

3.6 Product elements of QunQun
3.6.1 Account system

The QunQun Platform provides a complete account system. Users can join

the community on the QunQun Platform through mobile phone registration.

Each user will be equipped with an exclusive digital identity and the QunQun
digital wallet, with these information recorded on the blockchain in the

QunQun Platform network.

12/46
© QUNQUN
Through the use of digital identity, users can access the ecosystem on the
QunQun Platform without restrictions, and enjoy various blockchain-based

community functions provided by the QunQun Platform.

When entering a community, users are required to add their identity in the
community, which indicates that users can join multiple communities and
have a standalone identity in each community, and they can also participate
in the construction of communities. Eventually, all identities can be mapped
to the exclusive digital identity that the QunQun Platform has provided for

users.

Figure 2 Timeline

13/46
© QUNQUN
As a basic function of the QunQun Platform, all content published by a user
will be collated and presented on a “Timeline channel”. There are three types

of Timelines in each community: Interested, site and off-site.

Interested: It is used to display the contents collated from other users in

areas which the user has indicated previous interest.

Site: It is used to show the real-time dynamic release of all users in the

community and the information is arranged in reverse chronological order.

Off-site: It is used to show the content of foreign community members

transferred by members of the community.
3.6.3 Content distribution

QunQun allows users to publish the contents in different media formats: text,
images, videos and even live broadcast. A greater variety of media formats
will be available in the future, such as links, long text, sign-in, Q&A, item

transaction, etc.
3.6.4 Interaction function

Interaction module includes: Like, comment, incentive, forward, transmit,

share, etc.
1. Like

When consuming content in Timeline, users can give their favorite contents
“thumbs up” according to personal preference. The off-site Timeline also
allows users to give likes on their favorite contents, and the information can

be accumulated into the disseminating data of the original content.
2. Comment

When browsing content, users can interact with the creator or other users
based on the content through the comments section. The off-site content in

this community is also equipped with the function of comment and
14/46
© QUNQUN
interaction.

3. Incentives

Users can directly incentivise creators of high-quality content with QUN. The
amount of QUN incentive (less small transaction costs of transacting on the
blockchain network) will be owned by the content creator; neither the QunQun
Platform nor community sitemaster/management team will get a share of
this direct QUN incentive. In order to improve the incentive function (as
compared to a blockchain transfer), users of the QunQun Platform will be able

to have a “quick incentive” function through the use of a built-in wallet.
4. Forward

Users can forward the content of interest to fans / followers, so as to

reinforce social relationships.
5. Transmit

As the unique function of the QunQun Platform, the “Transmit” function is a

basic function to realise cross-site function.

As the member of a community, users may still view the contents of other
communities. After finding other communities on the QunQun Platform, users
may browse through other communities as tourists based on the “passing
account system”. Users who are interested in contents of a community and
who want to share it with other members of their own communities may use
the “Transmit” function (only available on the QunQun Platform) to share the

content and creator to their own communities.
The transmitted contents will be displayed on the off-site Timeline.
6. Share

When consuming content in the community, users may share high-quality

content to third-party social platforms for their friends on other social

15/46
© QUNQUN
platforms.

The third-party sharing function on the QunQun Platform supports several
mainstream social platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Wechat, QQ, Weibo,

etc.
3.6.5 Find

With the growth in the community and ecosystem, the increase in number of
site-masters / managers and users will definitely result in a larger number of
communities. Therefore, users should have certain mechanisms to assist
them in finding their communities of interest. The QunQun Platform will
incorporate a “Find” mechanism in time to allow users to connect with

interesting communities, users and contents.
3.6.6 App Center

There are two categories of applications in the App Center. The first category
comprises various functions and applications developed by the QunQun
Platform, while the other comprises applications developed by third-party

developers with the tools provided by the QunQun Platform.

To enrich the functions of community, create more entertainment channels,
as well as to activate the community, the site-master/management team may
add or open the necessary applications according to the community's

requirements.
1. Applications developed by the QunQun Platform

With the purpose of improving the operational efficiency of each community,
the QunQun Platform provides each community with abundant tools used for
community construction and operation. For example, a “Community Data”
App provides the statistical analysis function for new user data, held-out data,
user behavior data and all content-related core data that has received interest

during community operation.
© QUNQUN
Meanwhile, the QunQun Platform will provide a variety of community robots
(Bot) to assist the site-master / management team. For example, Headline
Bot can automatically generate the key contents of the community, and find
out the contents that are in line with the interest of community members, as
well as assist the site-master / management team to more easily construct
the community. It is envisaged that the variety of Bots will play a vital role in

development of content on the QunQun Platform and community activation.
2. Other application provided by third-party developer

In line with the decentralisation concept of blockchain technology, the
QunQun Platform will launch an open platform for third-party developers,
while gradually improving its blockchain technology. Any competent
developer may develop and provide a variety of third-party applications (e.g.
various tools, social networks and games for community) based on the open
API provided by the QunQun Platform.

Incentive mechanism

QunQun has set up a special ecosystem incentive mechanism which uses the
native Token (QUN) of the QunQun Platform as the only mechanism for the
payment of incentives. A double-layer incentive mechanism based on the
unique POA (POA) + POC (Proof of Contribution) algorithm is formulated on
the platform and used to incentivise the participants who make contributions

to development of the community and ecosytem.

The Incentive Pool system would perform a calculation of incentive
distribution every 24 hours. According to the calculation result, QUN
incentives will be automatically distributed to the personal wallet of each

participant.

4.1 Incentive Pool

Incentive Pool is a Token pool exclusively used to incentivise users who
contribute towards development of the ecosystem. Incentive Pool will be

replenished daily according to the incentive elastic coefficient.
4.2 Community incentive distribution--- Proof of Activity

Incentive Pool will perform the first-layer incentive distribution by using POA
(Proof of Activity), which means that QUN in the Incentive Pool shall be

distributed to each community based on its activity.

The calculation of POA is as follows: Incentive Poll will calculate the valid
DAU, valid posts, valid number of post, valid page views, valid number of page
view, valid likes, valid number of like, valid comments, valid number of
comment, the average number of posts view, the average online duration,

peak concurrent users and number of new users of each community every 24

18/46
© QUNQUN

hours. The activity A,,of each community is:
k

An = » aF;
i=l

Herein k the number of factors, while F;stands for the value of all factors

proving the community activity obtained by using normalisation algorithm, a;

is the weight of different factors.

The daily allocation is new currency of R. All existing communities shall be
included in the distribution. Accordingly, the overall incentive R,, obtained by

each community shall be:

-_- x

Rn — n .
y= A

Herein n is the number of communities within the whole ecosystem by the

end of distribution.

After a community receives the POA distribution from the Incentive Pool, the
QUN received will be distributed to the site-master/management team and
users participating in the development of the community based on a certain
percentage. The initial distribution ratio of site-master/management team to
users would be 40%: 60%. The site master/management team may be
entitled to adjust the distribution ratio with users participating in the
development of the community, so long as it ratio payable to the site-master/
managemement team does not exceed 50%. The remaining QUN should be
distributed as user incentives to users participating in the development of the
community construction, according to the Proof of Contribution calculation

(described below).

19/46
© QUNQUN
4.3 Users incentive distribution--- Proof of Contribution
In addition to site-masters, users in a community may also receive QUN
distributed to the community daily. Users incentive will be distributed to each

active user according to POC (Proof of Contribution) algorithm.

QunQun can calculate Level L,, for each user by calculating the behaviors of
browses, likes, comments, incentives, and forwards obtained by the content
after creating and publishing, as well as the behaviors of post view and the

browses, likes and comments to others’ post:
k
L,= » a,O;
i=l

Herein O; is the value of single behavior’s number obtained by using
normalisation algorithm; it not only includes the active behaviors such as
likes, comments, post, etc., but includes the passive behaviors such as being
interested, being liked, post being viewed, post being commented, etc. a;
refers to the weight of each behavior. Different behaviors will have different
thresholds for O; within a fixed period of time. If being performed after

exceeding the threshold, the behavior will no longer affect user's level.

The community would receive QUN as incentives from the QunQun Platform
via POA mechanism every 24 hours. Part of the obtained QUN will be
distributed to the creator and management team of the community. The other
part will be distributed to incentivise users who make intraday contributions

to the community by virtue of POC mechanism.

The intraday contribution of community users C,, shall be calculated by
calculating the number of single user’s active behavior S and passive

behavior within the same day and their weights:
© QUNQUN

C, = y aS,+ Yad

i=1 i=l j=l

Herein S;, is the value of single active behavior's number obtained by using
normalisation algorithm, while a; refers to the weight of the active behavior. /;

is the weight of single passive behavior, while / refers to the number of users
who perform the single passive behavior. During the calculation of passive
behavior, weight distinction is conducted to the levels of users who perform
the passive behaviors. In simple terms, if someone with higher level performs
the behaviors such as like, comment, etc. to a post, then the post creator will
obtain higher contribution. However, the number of each behavior is

calculated for only once.

R,,, refers to the monetary incentive obtained by the community via POA.
After the proportion of community operators being deducted, the incentive

which may be obtained by an ordinary user r,s:

Cr
r, = ——— *(1 - 0)R,,

s=l Cs

Herein o refers to the proportion that management team shall receive, while t

is the number of members in the community by the end of distribution.

positive discussions, and creation of communication atmosphere.

As the solid basis of all site-master in the ecosystem, the QunQun Platform
will incentivise site-master/management teams with QUN according to the
operation of all communities, and based on the unique POA (Proof of Activity)

mechanism.
5.3 User

Users can be regarded as the cornerstone around which the ecosystem and

community on the QunQun Platform is built.

After registering on the QunQun Platform, users may join any community that
they are interested in. Users may publish image-text and videos, participate in

22/46
© QUNQUN
the community construction, as well as interact with other users in the
community. Users who create high-quality content will be able to receive POC

incentives (paid in QUN) daily.

Users are the major driving force of consumption in the ecosystem, and will
be required to pay QUN in exchange for various services / products on the
QunQun Platform (e.g. payment of incentive, purchase of content, purchase

of apps, purchase and/or playing games).
5.4 Developer

Developers play an important role in the diversified ecosystem on the QunQun
Platform. The Foundation’s goal is to drive the whole community ecosystem
based on blockchain technology and build an open and dependable social
application platform. Not only will the Foundation provide basic technical
support, anyone or institution possessing developmental capability can
develop the third-party applications for the ecosystem on the QunQun

Platform.
5.5 Advertiser
Advertisers are an important part of the economy on the QunQun Platform.

With the growth of various communities, the QunQun Platform will gradually
introduce eco-friendly advertisers into the community. Part of the advertising
revenue will go to the Foundation and applied in accordance with its objects,

while the rest will be paid to the Incentive Pool in the form of QUN.

Outlook

The QunQun Platform aims to become the largest and most active
community platform in the blockchain digital world. With the rapid promotion

of digital currency users and penetration of this market, it is envisaged that
23/46
© QUNQUN
the model of the QunQun Platform will gradually fulfill its true potential and

obtain geometric growth finally.

In order to continuously support the development of the community on the
QunQun Platform, it is planned that the commercial revenue of the QunQun

Platform will mainly come from the following ways:
6.1 Sales and transactions of virtual goods

The QunQun Platform QunQun will develop and design various virtual goods
on the community platform (e.g. forms of community themes, skins, paid
virtual items, as well as various personal virtual images for individuals). Some
of these virtual goods may be obtained for free, while the rest will be sold in

exchange for QUN.

There will be a transaction market on the QunQun Platform which is able to
support transfers between users, as well as the transaction of various virtual
goods. The QunQun Platform will charge a commission in QUN for these

transaction costs.
6.2 Application and game revenue sharing

The QunQun Platform will provide tools for third-party developers to provide
applications and SNS games for the community, and charge a portion of the

revenues of these applications and games as fees.
6.3 Advertising revenue

Advertising is one of the critical revenue streams for the QunQun Platform.
With the help of intelligent and reliable blockchain advertising and value
analysis systems, the QunQun Platform combines advertising with a
community incentive model, effectively connectsingthe advertisers with users

so as to maximise the interests of all parties.

The average revenue per user (ARPU) metric for digital currency users is

24/46
© QUNQUN
several times that of traditional mobile Internet users, which is expected to

assist the rapid development of the QunQun Platform.

Technical realisation

There are three layers included in the overall technical architecture of the
QunQun Platform: client, community platform and underlying architecture.

7.1 Client

Client refers to various terminal products which the QunQun Platform has
provided for users to meet their different demands (including iOS, Android,
H5, etc). The QunQun Platform will also provide a full-featured RESTful API.

Any developer may develop efficiency tools or games based on 25hese API.
25/46
© QUNQUN
When fully developed, the QunQun Platform will provide a site-master/
management team with a community management tool (Dashboard) which
includes theme templates, function options, management of application plug-

in, etc.
7.2 Community platform

Clients can access the services provided by the QunQun Platform via RESTful
API. In order to provide RESTful API with high availability, high concurrence
and high performance, the components such as load balancing, log storage,
service monitoring, message queue, authorisation checking, account

unification and data statistics will be established within the QunQun Platform.

Account module provides basic accounting service for the ecosystem on the
QunQun Platform. The Account module is designed to be compatible with an
Ethereum account in an optimal manner. Such a unified QunQun account will
be able to ensure security of funds, as well as allow users to enjoy all services
quickly and easily. Users may view information of other communities within
the APP and also but interact with users from other communities (e.g.

functions such as liking, commenting).

Statistics module aims to record and save all core operations of the QunQun
Platform so as to perform various data analysis. The data analysis includes
calculation of community activity, calculation of user contribution, calculation

of developer sharing, etc.

The QunQun Platform will provide various tools for developers to develop the
third-party applications that are suitable for the ecosystem on the QunQun
Platform based on the various interfaces provided by the QunQun Platform.
After the launch of the developer platform, the QunQun Platform will offer
technical documentation and sample programs so as to help developers get

started quickly.

7.3 Underlying architecture

The underlying technology architecture of blockchain + IPFS will be adopted
by the QunQun Platform.

7.3.1 Blockchain

Part of QunQun's core services is formulated on the basis of blockchain
technology. The blockchain of QunQun is developed based on the integration
of Ethereum public chain at present. The native chain of the QunQun Platform
(QunQun Blockchain), which is designed to be more suitable for social

communities, will be launched in the future.
1. Account

Mark of user's sole digital identity;

2. Token

The native cryptographic token designed to be used on the QunQun Platform
(QUN) is based on ERC-20 standard. Users may check their QUN balance
through the QunQun Platform or any application which supports ERC-20
standard. Before the launch of QunQun Blockchain, to get around the
technical barrier, the QunQun Platform will issue the representative token on
the Ethereum blockchain, and perform a transfer once the development of the
QunQun Blockchain is complete. This transfer will have no effect on the

usage and digital assets of users.
3. Smart contract

The “smart contract” of Ethereum is Turing-complete. Various constraints
shall be written into the smart contract in QunQun ecosystem. The realisation

of some community-related contracts is shown as follows:

@ Community information
© QUNQUN
Anyone can establish a community by paying certain amounts of QUN to the
QunQun Platform. In order to mark the uniqueness and ownership of that
community, community information and ownership will be written into the

smart contract of the QunQun Platform.
The creation and transferring of community are shown as follows:
» Create a community

Anyone can establish a community by paying QUN. Community information
and ownership will be written into smart contract of QunQun. The sample

code of contract is as follows:

//Community data structure

struct sitelnfo {

string name;

string status;

bool is_exist;

address owner;

uint32 price;

}

uint32 SITE_LCREATE_PRICE = 50;

mapping (address => uint256) public balanceOf; // account balance
mapping (bytes32 => sitelnfo) public site_info; // community list
event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);
/**

* Create a community

*/

function createSite(address owner, bytes32 site_key, string name)
28/46
© QUNQUN
public returns (bool success) {

//Check whether the identity is already taken.
require(site_info[site_key].is_exist == false);

//Check balance, ORIGIN_PRICE refers to the cost of creating a community.
The initial price is 49.99QUN

require(balanceOf[owner] >= SITE_CREATE_PRICE);
//Set the community ownership
site_info[site_key].is_exist = true;
site_info[site_key].owner = owner;

//Set the status as running
site_info[site_key].status = "running",

//Set the community name
site_info[site_key].name = name;

// Deduct expenses, QUNQUN_ACCOUNT refers to the account of community

platform

_transfer(owner, QUNQUN_ACCOUNT, SITE_CREATE_PRICE),;

return true;

}

» Purchase a community

If users want to purchase a community available for sale, they can perform

the fee purchasing and ownership transferring independently by virtue of
calling smart contract. The sample code of contract is shown as follows:

[**
* Purchase a community

*/
29/46
© QUNQUN
function buySite(bytes32 site_key) public returns (bool success) {

//Check whether the community is for sale.
require(sha3(site_info[site_key].status) == sha3(‘for_sale"));

// Check whether the account balance of contract caller is adequate.
require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= site_info[site_key]. price);

//Account transfer

_transfer(msg.sender, site_info[site_key].owner, site_info[site_key].price);
//Ownership transfer

site_info[site_key].owner = msg.sender;

return true;

}

Apart from the above functions, the smart contract of QunQun will also save
the core operational data such as user scale, active reservation, eco-incentive,

etc.;
@Ecosystem rules

The shared proportion of POA incentives that is shared by site-master/

management team and community users.

Rules for revenue sharing between the QunQun Platform and third-party

developers of applications.

Rules for sharing of advertising revenue between the QunQun Platform, site-

master/ management team and users of the QunQun Platform.
Quantity of QUN required to create a community.
Other ecosystem rules that shall be included with the development of the

QunQun Platform.

30/46
© QUNQUN
7.3.2 IPFS

IPFS network is fine-grained, distributed and highly compatible content
distribution network. The photos, videos, documents generated by users on
the QunQun Platform will be stored on IPFS. The QunQun Platform will record
statistics to the resources usage of each community, and take measures (e.g.

warnings, account banning) against users found to have abused resources.

Issuance plan

8.1 QUN

In order to motivate developers of the community and participants, and
improve the ecosystem on the QunQun Platform, the native cryptographic
token designed to be used on the QunQun Platform (QUN) is a major

component of the ecosystem on the QunQun Platform.

QUN is a non-refundable functional utility token which will be used as the unit
of exchange between participants on the QunQun Platform. QUN does not in
any way represent any shareholding, participation, right, title, or interest in the
Foundation, its affiliates, or any other company, enterprise or undertaking, nor
will QUN entitle token holders to any promise of fees, revenue, profits or
investment returns, and are not intended to constitute securities in Singapore
or any relevant jurisdiction. QUN may only be utilised on the QunQun
Platform, and ownership of QUN carries no rights, express or implied, other
than the right to use QUN as a means to enable usage of and interaction with
the QunQun Platform.

In particular, you understand and accept that QUN:

(a)is non-refundable cannot be exchanged for cash (or its equivalent value in

any other virtual currency) or any payment obligation by the Foundation or

31/46
© QUNQUN
any affiliate;

(b) does not represent or confer on the token holder any right of any form with
respect to the Foundation (or any of its affiliates) or its revenues or assets,
including without limitation any right to receive future revenue, shares,
ownership right or stake, share or security, any voting, distribution,
redemption, liquidation, proprietary (including all forms of intellectual
property), or other financial or legal rights or equivalent rights, or
intellectual property rights or any other form of participation in or relating

to the QunQun Platform, the Foundation and/or its service providers;

(c)is not intended to be a representation of money (including electronic
money), security, commodity, bond, debt instrument or any other kind of

financial instrument or investment;

(d)is not a loan to the Foundation or any of its affiliates, is not intended to
represent a debt owed by the Foundation or any of its affiliates, and there

is no expectation of profit; and

(e) does not provide the token holder with any ownership or other interest in

the Foundation or any of its affiliates.

The contributions in the token sale will be held by the Foundation (or its
affiliate) after the token sale, and contributors will have no economic or legal
right over or beneficial interest in these contributions or the assets of that

entity after the token sale.

To the extent a secondary market or exchange for trading QUN does develop,
it would be run and operated wholly independently of the Foundation, the sale
of QUN and the QunQun Platform. The Foundation will not create such

secondary markets nor will it act as an exchange for QUN.
8.1.1 Application scenario of QUN

Application scenarios of QUN include but not limited to:

32/46
© QUNQUN
1. Purchase a community: Users can purchase an initiatory community from
the official platform of QunQun, or they may purchase a mature community

which is on sale via the market on the QunQun Platform.

2. Incentive: The QunQun Platform will incentivise users and site-masters that

make contributions to the community with QUN.

3. Incentive: Users may use QUN to incentivise creators of high-quality

content on the QunQun Platform.

4. Purchase the paid content: Users can purchase the paid content prepared

by other users.

5. Purchase the third-party applications: Some third-party applications are not

for free, therefore, users shall purchase then by paying QUN.

6. Purchase virtual goods or game items: Users can purchase various on-sale

virtual goods or participate in community games to purchase game items.

7. Advertisements: Advertisers may advertise effectively through the
blockchain advertising system on the QunQun Platform through the payment
of QUN.

8.1.2 Methods to obtain QUN

1. Participate in the supporting programs of private placement and purchase
QUN with ETH.

2. Participate in the development of the ecosystem on the QunQun Platform

to obtain QUN as an incentive.

3. Publish high-quality content and obtain QUN incentives from other users.
4. Purchase QUN from third-party transaction platforms.

8.2 Distribution plan

The initial issuance of QunQun is 1.5 billion QUN, based on the following
33/46
© QUNQUN
distribution plan:

8.2.1 Presale

The proceeds of the presale of QUN will be applied towards technological
research and development, cost of hardware and bandwidth, project

operation, and market promotion of projects on QunQun Platform.
8.2.2 Funding for the Foundation

The project to develop the QunQun Platform is a long term project. In order to
ensure continuous development of the QunQun Platform, it is necessary for
the Foundation to continuously recruit excellent talents to work on the
project. At the same time, as part of the development process, some
important nodes will be reached and more partners will be needed to
complete it. This portion of the supply of QUN will be applied towards
incentivising team members and business partners who may contribute to

the development of the QunQun Platform at later stages.
8.2.3 Ecosystem incentive fund

The initial token sale for the QunQun Platform will set aside 15% of QUN for
the ecosystem incentive fund, which is mainly used to make up the bonus
pool of the first-year platform. The system will determine the incentive elastic
coefficient according to the POA activity index, and allocate the

corresponding amount of QUN to the bonus pool daily.

Thereafter, the ecosystem incentive fund will be supplemented in the form of
additional issuance of QUN yearly after the second year. The additional
issuance each year will be 9.5% of the total amount from the second year, and

this will decrease by 0.5% yearly until it falls to 1%.
8.2.4 QunQun team and early contributors

The QunQun team and early contributors had provided various products,

34/46

Risks

You acknowledge and agree that there are numerous risks associated with
purchasing QUN, holding QUN, and using QUN for participation in the QunQun

Platform.
1. Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions

The regulatory status of QUN and distributed ledger technology is unclear or
unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is impossible to predict how, when or
whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulations or create new
regulations with respect to such technology and its applications, including
QUN and/or the QunQun Platform. Regulatory actions could negatively
impact QUN and/or the QunQun Platform in various ways. The Foundation (or
its affiliates) may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that
regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate
in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary

regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.

After consulting with a wide range of legal advisors and continuous analysis
of the development and legal structure of virtual currencies, the Foundation
will apply a cautious approach towards the sale of QUN. Therefore, for the
presale, the Foundation may constantly adjust the sale strategy in order to
avoid relevant legal risks as much as possible. For the presale, the
Foundation is working with Tzedek Law LLC, a boutique corporate law firm in

Singapore with a good reputation in the blockchain space.
2. Loss of Talent

The development of the QunQun Platform depends on the continued co-
operation of the existing technical team and expert consultants, who are
highly knowledgeable and experienced in their respective sectors. The loss of

any member may adversely affect the QunQun Platform or its future
© QUNQUN
development.

3. Competitors

It is possible that alternative networks could be established that utilise the
same or similar code and protocol underlying QUN and/or the QunQun
Platform and attempt to re-create similar facilities. The QunQun Platform may
be required to compete with these alternative networks, which could

negatively impact QUN and/or the QunQun Platform.
4. Security weaknesses

Hackers or other malicious groups or organisations may attempt to interfere
with QUN and/or the QunQun Platform in a variety of ways, including, but not
limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based
attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, there is a risk that
a third party or a member of the Foundation or its affiliates may intentionally
or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure of QUN
and/or the QunQun Platform, which could negatively affect QUN and/or the

QunQun Platform.
5. Failure to develop

There is the risk that the development of the QunQun Platform will not be
executed or implemented as planned, for a variety of reasons, including
without limitation the event of a decline in the prices of any digital asset,
virtual currency or QUN, unforeseen technical difficulties, and shortage of

development funds for activities.
6. Other risks

In addition to the aforementioned risks, there are other risks (as more
particularly set out in the Token Purchase Agreement) associated with your
purchase, holding and use of QUN, including those that the Foundation
cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialise as unanticipated
© QUNQUN
variations or combinations of the aforementioned risks. You should conduct
full due diligence on the Foundation (and its affiliates), the QunQun team,
understand the overall framework and vision for the QunQun Platform prior to

purchasing QUN.

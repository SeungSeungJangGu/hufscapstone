DAPS

“WHITEPAPER
INTRODUCTION

DAPS is a planned experimental hybrid fork-swap of Peepcoin, to be conducted in 2018.
The goal of DAPS protocol is to create a fully anonymous coin and eventually payment
system with a trustless governance structure, a first in crypto-currencies.

How will we do that? We have crafted a unique blend of tested obfuscation techniques,
some redundant, all vetted. We believe this will offer the most complete anonymity
package in any Protocol to date, with on-chain Trustless Governance solution, called
Proof-of-Audit, a first in the sphere. Utilizing various successful features of competing
protocols, we hope to implement a multi-layered and fully anonymous system with
mandatory privacy while also removing the "trust issue" of completely private networks.

The legacy of DAPS is rooted in Peepcoin, a coin based on the libzerocoin protocol with

anonymity features removed. We will be enabling these features, running on DAPS network,

and allow Peepcoin holders to swap to this new chain upon completion. The swap will be

credited on a1:1 basis at a to-be-confirmed (TBC) date.

A main push for DAPS is to anonymize assets, and secure an infrastructure for development
of further features. DAPS aims to be more than a coin, but a culture.
o WHY DAPS?

In traditional blockchains and various "partial" anonymity chains, the users are exposed to
analytics and malicious attack vectors. Oppressive governments around the world use this
data to track and punish cryptocurrency users. We aim to preserve everyone's right to
control their finances as they see fit.

“HISTORY OF
HARPOCRATES (DAPS) PROTOCOL

The Zerocoin Protocol (libzerocoin) is the foundation for many of the privacy coins we see
today. Used by other assets to create relatively safe and secure privacy assets, this protocol

is highly vetted and is considered the standard for privacy implementation.

Using this privacy foundation, many coins expanded on the Zerocoin (libzerocoin) Protocol in

various ways, with one notable example being DASH.

The DASH Team created a new layer called "Masternodes" on top of this Zerocoin Protocol,
to strengthen the network and allow additional chain features to be added. These features
include Instantsend, Privatesend, and enabling Masternodes to vote on proposals, decen-

tralizing the network's governance out of developer's hands. PIVX expanded on this concept
by enabling a "see-saw reward scheme" for Masternodes, to strengthen Masternode

incentives vs staking.

Following the Decentralized Anonymous Payment scheme protocol definition as described
by Sasson et al (2014), DAP scheme is described as a method of payment that allows users

o directly make payments to one another privately by hiding the origin and destination of
he payment including the payment amount. This approach to cryptocurrency employs
“zero-knowledge” proofs that prevents analysis of transactions or addresses.

Utilizing proposals and initiatives like RingCT in conjunction with other vetted features, we

hope to achieve complete obfuscation of users in a trustless network.

“An obvious way to negate the downsides of the CryptNote protocol... would be to
implement hidden amounts for any transaction" -Shen Noether, Ring Signature Confidential

Transactions for Monero]

This mix of features and protocol will be called the Harpocrates Protocol, providing a

trustless, completely anonymous network.
~ THE
BITCOIN PROBLEM

Bitcoin is not anonymous. By design to prevent double-spends, the blockchain is fully public
and visible to anyone. This data is easily tracked and used by unscrupulous actors. This
makes Bitcoin trustless, i.e. you do not need to "trust" any bitcoin node operator, you can
verify the chain status with third party means. This is one of the ways Bitcoin network

secures network health, at the cost of complete monetary exposure.

MAKING TRUSTED TRUSTLESS

Privacy currencies are not fully private. The only “fully private" chain is Zcash, which is not a
trustless system. To become a fully private blockchain, a degree of trust must be given to
the "Nodes" (Masternodes/Nodes) as a central governance of the coin supply, inflation and

various specifications. This is the "Trust Issue" of completely private coins.

In a completely anonymous currency, node operators can collude off-chain to generate

infinite coins (Zcash Hyperinflation Hack) in secret with no third party to verify if the chain is
under such attack. As you cannot roll back changes, it is critical to be able to detect any such

attacks or collusion as they happen and not after the fact like with Zcash's Zerocash

protocol.

To introduce a degree of Trust-less-ness to the Trust system of a completely private coin is
a sea-change in how privacy coins can be handled. This on-chain Trustless Trust solution will
be called Proof-Of-Audit.
“ WHAT IS THE "TRUST ISSUE"?

In acompletely anonymous private coin network, you must trust the nodes to be working in
good faith. There is no outside verification for transactions, balances, or emissions. To know
how the chain is doing, you must be given information from "Trusted Nodes". How do you
verify the chain's authenticity when the watchmen are the people who tell you the chain's
status? It is a question major privacy coins have setup commissions to handle. This is the
"Trust Issue" of completely anonymous crypto-currencies, since you have to trust the node

operators are working honestly.

In theory, in a completely anonymous chain, no matter the protocol, node owners can
collude off-chain to run their nodes maliciously. This can be disastrous in many ways for any
network, and represents a built-in security risk to previous iterations of wholly private
networks. If nodes were to collude, generate infinite coins for themselves in secret, and
spend them, the world would be unable to discover this as the transactions and balances

will be hidden from public view.

To be trustless an objective third party must be able to verify the coin supply, check coin
emissions, and make sure nodes are not being used maliciously. We do not believe trusting
the honesty of node owners should be the only backstop against malicious actions.

The Harpocrates Protocol will have a hard coded solution to the "Trust Issue" elegantly using

the protocols already available. More details about this will be released in it's own white

paper.
“ MASTERNODES
AND YOU

APS Masternodes are required to have 1,000,000 DAPS collateral, a dedicated IP address,
and be able to run 24 hours a day without more than a1 hour connection loss. Masternodes
get paid using the See-saw method as described in the next section. For offering their
services to the network, Masternodes are paid a portion of block rewards to maintain the
ecosystem. This payment will be in DAPS and it serves as a form of passive income to the
Masternode owners.

The DAPS Masternode system is modeled after the PIVX Master node system. This has
many bonuses, including preventing a 51% attack unless both layers are compromised
simultaneously.

The SBRS (See-Saw Balance Reward System) will have a 60/40 MN/PoS reward split
balancing to a maximum of 40/60 MN/PoS reward split. This will give a fair reward to
holders with too little coins to partake in a Masternode, an issue in many Masternode coin

networks.

TOR LAYER
Nodes will be mandatory TOR Hidden Services, with onion addresses to prevent attacks on
node operators by tracing IP or port usage.

As some countries block Tor access, OBFS4 will also be implemented so that users from
these countries can continue to use the wallet as they wish. OBFS4 will be mandatory along
with TOR Hidden services, to allow anyone to access the network from anywhere. One
trade-off of this technology is slower wallet synchronization times on launch, which is
acceptable in order to achieve wholly-obfuscated nodes.

MANDATORY STEALTH
DAPS will have a public and a private address system, with private being the default option.
Users will be able to create public addresses at any time, with a dynamic stealth address
allocated to the public address on time of receiving transaction, being re-hashed on
completion.

EMISSIONS, FOUNDER'S FEE, SPECS
Additionally, Posv3 will be integrated, with block rewards set to 1050. This is inspired by the
Bitbean capped staking system, and will result in staking being more fair long term.

To help secure a development infrastructure, 5% of DAPS emissions will be used in the
DAPS Development Fund, which will be split between DAPS Core and the DAPS Foundation
to utilize for their respective missions. More information about DAPSCore and DAPS
foundation will be released on future date.

DAPS CHAIN SPECS:

HARPOCRATES PROTOCOL
SECRECY - FULL CONFIDENTIALITY - TRUSTLESS

NODES/IPS
= Mandatory Tor relay for all nodes
Hides all node/masternode IP addresses, which can be used as attack vectors

® Utilize OBFS4, will obfuscate in "blocked" countries

If TOR traffic is blocked, OBFS4 will activate, and mask the Tor layer, allowing normal

function. This will allow the DAPS wallet to run on any network, anywhere.

TRANSACTIONS
= Privatesend, using Coinjoin++
Coins will be mixed before all transactions, powered by Masternodes
= ZK-snarks
All transaction metadata is completely encrypted
® Ring CT (confidential transaction)
Hide amount sent or staked in raw TX

BALANCES
= Mandatory stealth address
Stealth/Public address system, with STEALTH address dynamic for PUBLIC address,
preventing tracking STEALTH address
= Ring CT, obfuscate address
Ring CT will also obfuscate wallet balance

OTHER FEATURES

= PoSV3 - Energy efficient, fair

® Static emissions - No fancy inflation models, flat emissions

= 10MB Block size - Scalable into indefinite future

= Masternodes

= Onchain supply "audit" - address "Trustless Trust" issue of wholly-private network - The
Harpocrates keystone. This will be called "Proof-Of-Audit". As details of this are highly
confidential, we will not release this information until it is implemented to prevent copycat
Protocols from emerging in other competitors.

Using the above chain features, we hope to completely obfuscate transactions, addresses,
balances, and nodes/IP. With a built in coin supply audit on-chain, the system will be
trustless and avoid the "trust" issue of wholly-private coins. Released under the MIT license,
this unique mix of features will be called the Harpocrates Protocol and we believe it will
change the standard for privacy coins.

As total Decentralization is the long term goal, future feature pushes will include

cross-chain/off-chain swaps (Atomic Swaps) to help remove the influence of exchanges on
the market.

NoTEs:

= OBSF4 is not as established as TOR, possible weaknesses

= TOR/OBSF4 increases sync times, trade-off for anonymity

= Coinjoin/Privatesend may be redundant with Stealth Addresses, will decide if performance
trade-off is worth implementation

= Masternodes are not a Trustless governance model, must have auxiliary chain verification
("Audit")

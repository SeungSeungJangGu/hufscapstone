1. Summary

CyberMiles Foundation Limited (“CyberMiles Foundation”), is a company limited by guarantee
to be incorporated in Hong Kong and governed in a not-for-profit manner. It will work closely
with 5miles LLC (“Smiles”), with the aim of developing CyberMiles: a next-generation
blockchain optimized for e-commerce and designed for mainstream adoption.

By focusing on e-commerce and online marketplaces, CyberMiles will integrate the latest
blockchain innovations to power “Smart Business Contracts” on a highly effective chain, and
resolve the latency issues associated with existing, general-use blockchains. Its utility token,
CyberMiles Token, is planned to be a “master token” to fund & empower new e-commerce
applications and projects, similar to how ETH is used for the current generation of ICOs.

Throughout the network development, CyberMiles Foundation will be assisting the governance
of the decentralized platform, with strong involvement by members of the ecosystem. Our
vision for the future is a public network that provides secure and trusted business services for
its members, by its members.

5miles plans to gradually migrate its sellers and buyers, as the first group of users, onto the
decentralized network. In other words, S5miles’s marketplace platform will be one of the first
environments to utilize the network as a back-end service and jumpstart the ecosystem. Once
the network reaches a critical mass, its own network effects, strengthened by incentives
provided by the CyberMiles Token (“CMT”), are expected to be applied to other partner
platforms and marketplaces, driving CyberMiles’ development as a market-leading blockchain
protocol for commercial and marketplace applications.

5miles

5miles is a leader in consumer-to-consumer (“c2c”) e-commerce in the United States. Its
flagship application, the 5miles app, has over 10 million registered American users, and is
estimated to surpass $3 billion in total transaction value in 2017?. The 5miles app is rated a top
10 shopping application in the United States?. On average, Smiles users spend 24 minutes per
day on the app, making it easily one of the most engaging e-commerce apps in the US 3.

5miles has been active in the research and development of blockchain technologies. We
believe that blockchain technologies could provide natural solutions to common problems in a
c2c e-commerce network. For example, the blockchain network’s mechanism for reaching
consensus amongst non-cooperative strangers (that is, reaching the Nash equilibrium of the
network) is a key feature that could allow c2c sellers and buyers to reach agreements, and

hence greatly reduce the cost associated with customer support and dispute resolutions. The
blockchain network’s digital token could provide a very efficient in-network settlement
currency, and greatly reduce transaction costs. It could also act as a springboard for members
of the community to create their own initiative, creating a strong network effect. The
blockchain network’s decentralized computing infrastructure could ensure that the
marketplace will never go offline, and significantly reduce certain operator’s IT expenses.
Furthermore, blockchain technology could facilitate and even automate business transactions
through the use of smart contracts and an immutable ledger.

2. Vision and Motivation

Modern society’s commercial infrastructure has evolved to favor the largest players, from big
box retailers like Walmart, to e-commerce giants like Amazon. These players have accumulated
the scale advantages that allowed them to achieve greater efficiency through centralized
procurement, marketing, and distribution. But while efficient, these giants of commerce and
retail are completely centralized operations focused on selling new, standardized products. The
constant influx of new products, combined by the vast amounts spent on marketing and
advertising to convince consumers to buy these products, has resulted in a wasteful society
where unused or lightly used products are either taking up space in our homes or exist as waste
in landfill.

Certain platforms that allow c2c trading have harnessed the internet to better connect buyers
and sellers. They encourage the resale of products across different categories and geographic
markets. However, these platforms are also centrally managed, running all the functions such
as listings review, dispute resolution, payments, and allocation of user traffic. As a result of
centralizing all these functions and limiting payment solutions to a handful of providers, the
total costs of conducting business can be as high as 15% of the merchandise value 4.
Furthermore, in pursuit of greater scalability on its centralized functions, many of the products
sold such platforms often come from larger, more established merchants, selling products with
larger inventory.

From its formation in 2014, Smiles has set out to establish a very different kind of marketplace,
one that was built to enable truly c2c transactions and unlock value from pre-existing
merchandise. Its platform is completely mobile-based, enabling real-time, location-specific
communication to finalize deals amongst friends and strangers alike in a safe environment.
Due to its market-by-market focus, 5miles has also been an important tool for many local
businesses, who otherwise would have been closed out from online marketing, which usually
favors businesses with deeper pockets and advanced technical capabilities to run online
campaigns. All users, from casual shoppers to business accounts, have unique user profiles,
peer ratings and reviews, ensuring that good marketplace participants would naturally garner

more interest and business on Smiles. In essence, Smiles has been building an online
ecosystem that leverages geographic proximity between users to create vibrant marketplaces.

From its vantage point of a c2c marketplace operator, Smiles is a strong believer that
blockchain-based technology and decentralized processes can further revolutionize online
marketplaces and local commerce. 5miles has seen that economic incentives, when
transparent and properly implemented, motivate people to be active and good participants in a
community. If those incentives can be earned throughout the various processes that run a
marketplace and online community, then many marketplace functions that are currently
centralized can be done in a decentralized manner, powered by the communities’ own
members. This strengthens the participation and creativity of its marketplace participants,
while at the same time allowing the network to become even more dynamic and scalable.

While promising, existing blockchains have not been able to address the needs of e-commerce
because 1) they are not designed to do so; 2) they have not solved the latency issues in order to
support the high volume of transactions typical of e-commerce platforms; and 3) the current
implementations of Smart Contracts are too primitive for e-commerce use.

That’s why CyberMiles Foundation is developing a next-generation blockchain protocol with the
following attributes:
e To support a large library of commerce-related Smart Business Contracts that power
decentralization of processes
e To manage user identity & transaction data privately & safely, while enabling new
transactions & settlements amongst network participants. Starting with Smiles’ 10+
million userbase, this access to user data will be a key driver for other e-commerce
& consumer finance platforms to be built on CyberMiles
e To utilize a delegated-PoS (“Proof-of-Stake”) consensus engine to support tens of
thousands of transactions per second (“TPS”), hence resolving latency issues of
existing chains.

In building this future, CyberMiles has the potential to be the first blockchain with both real-

world business application and mainstream adoption, and may also soon be one of the largest
blockchain networks in existence.

3. CyberMiles & Smiles Background

CyberMiles is the blockchain technology being developed by CyberMiles Foundation, a
blockchain research laboratory working closely with Smiles. Smiles was formed in 2014 by a
world-class team from China and the US. Since its inception, 5miles has since raised
approximately USD 62 million from top-tier investment firms such as SIG, IDG, Morningside,
and Blue Lake. Since the launch of its app in 2015, Smiles has already established itself as a Top
10 shopping app, with more than 12 million users and USD 3 billion in annual transaction value.
Its founding CEO, Dr. Lucas Lu, was previously a co-founder and CTO of Light In the Box, a
company which went public on the NYSE. Before that, Lucas was the first GM of Alibaba’s
Taobao Mobile platform.

underpin these solutions, and CMT aims to be the fuel for transactions, and serve to incentivize
participants in the ecosystem.

The CyberMiles Blockchain Protocol and CyberMiles Token

CyberMiles is a new blockchain protocol being developed and specifically designed and
optimized for business and marketplace applications. The protocol will consist of a blockchain
based “virtual machine” and defined modules of middleware software stacks, which operate
outside the chain to support decentralized processes governed by smart contracts
implemented on the network.

CMT is the native crypto token currency being created to be integrated with and used on the
CyberMiles network, and on decentralized applications on the network.

Initially, CMT is proposed to be issued and implemented on the public Ethereum blockchain as
an ERC-20 compliant token. 5miles will integrate its existing “wallet” function to hold CMT
balances, and allow users to utilize the tokens on the 5miles platform shortly after the tokens
are activated. The CyberMiles protocol is being developed for implementation on its own open
source blockchain. In this scenario, the initial CMT based on ERC-20 would be exchanged on a
1:1 basis with native CMT issued on CyberMiles’ blockchain, with any stored value & rights
transferred to the native token.

Our aim is for CMT to serve the following purposes:

1. To reward and incentivize community members to contribute computing power and
maintain the integrity of the network. Examples of such services could include running
network nodes, validating transactions, and executing smart business contracts. When
e-commerce market participants, such as sellers, buyers, and marketplace makers,
utilize the network services, they would provide CMTs to network maintainers.

2. To incentivize community members to provide value-add services, such as peer-to-peer
customer support and conflict resolution services. The service provider could receive
CMT from other members in the community after a consensus is reached.

3. To facilitate transactions within the network. Processes and interactions throughout the
supply chain, as well as between buyers and sellers, could be recorded and facilitated by
CMT. That allows for decentralized settlement and could potentially greatly reduce the
cost of transactions and friction on the network. The network would extract a
transaction fee to pay validators who execute smart business contracts associated with
the transaction.

In order to create the CyberMiles e-commerce ecosystem, substantive research and
development into blockchain technology itself is needed. Already, Smiles has developed a

cybermiles
(9,

novel blockchain protocol to support complex business transactions, known as ”smart business
contracts”, in blockchain networks, with CMT to be the native token for this new blockchain
protocol. This new blockchain protocol is further detailed in the CyberMiles Technical
Whitepaper available at ( https://cm.5miles.com/file/Technical%20White%20Paper.pdf ).
Interested technical readers are encouraged to read further, and join the open source
development community for CyberMiles.

4. Potential CyberMiles Applications - Smiles Case Study

5miles’ app is expected to be one of the first commercial applications to utilize the CyberMiles
blockchain network. In this section, we discuss specific application scenarios and features that
would be enabled by our proposed decentralized CyberMiles blockchain solution, and contrast
them with a typical centralized c2c e-commerce marketplace. The CyberMiles blockchain
protocol has a built-in mechanism through its tokens to help non-cooperative network
participants reach the Nash Equilibrium consensus.

A marketplace that never goes down

One of the key advantages of a decentralized network is the high availability of network
services. It is resistant to data center failures. As long as some network nodes are running, the
network services will be available — although the service capacity or bandwidth may fluctuate.

Today’s c2c marketplace apps depend on centralized servers and IT departments for back-end
services. If the data center goes down, the marketplace will cease to function. In the
CyberMiles blockchain network, computing power and business services can all be provided by
members of the community. And hence, the network service is more resilient to failures.

Community-based conflict resolution

The economic incentives introduced by CMT could provide a means for community-based
conflict resolution. This would save a marketplace operator, such as 5miles, the need for
employing and maintaining a team of customer service agents for resolving potential conflicts
between buyers and sellers. Subject to appropriate governance controls, volunteers in the
community could now be arbiters, and could use transactional data recorded transparently in
the blockchain to make judgements. This would work as follows:

e When a buyer and a seller enter into an agreement, they could each put up an equal
amount of CMT as a deposit for the transaction. If there is no dispute after the
transaction completes, each of them will automatically get back their tokens through a
smart business contract, or the CMT could act as a settlement currency.

cybermiles
(9,

e If adispute does occur, however, the network would automatically ask a pool of service
providers to bid to become an “arbiter”.

e The arbiter, once accepted by both parties, would work with both the buyer and seller
off the blockchain to resolve the conflict. Subject to compliance with data protection
rules, they would have full access to the transaction details.

e Once the arbiter makes a decision, the losing party would forfeit their deposited CMT to
the arbiter. The arbiter’s decision would be final, as this would have been pre-agreed by
both parties.

In this case, the service would be provided entirely by the members of the network community,
and the service providers are compensated with CMT. So, the value created by the network
could be represented in digital form, in CMT. The marketplace operators could focus on their
core competencies and eliminate the cost, energy and time associated with dispute resolution.

User-generated & user-curated “Smiles Groups”

5miles has plans to introduce user-generated forums and sub-communities (“Groups”) within
the platform. These Smiles Groups would focus on common interests (like “Fashionistas of
Dallas”, or “Vintage Cars Forum”) or by affiliation (church groups, school districts, universities,
etc.), and can be used to plan events and exchange ideas. However, for traditional platforms,
managing user forums is a difficult task, as centrally- managed forums lack local authenticity and
flexibility.

CyberMiles could contain smart-contract modules to enable
and incentivize the marketplace participants to form and
manage these sub-communities. Network members can use
a certain amount of CMT to propose and establish a new
Group. To join a particular Group, participants pay
“membership dues” in CMT, with part of the proceeds
utilized by a Group moderator. Businesses or participants
who want to promote their products or businesses to
members of these Groups would have to pay an access fee
(determined and governed by smart business contracts), and
members could also use CMT to facilitate events (like school
|9} fundraisers, etc.). Groups with the highest amount of
yal pe LL ta participation will rank highest and receive more prominence

Local Promotions and Brand Ambassadors

As a local marketplace, focused on achieving very high user density in each of its markets,
5miles has naturally attracted a large number of local businesses, including service providers,
retailers and resellers, restaurants, and free-lance professionals. For many of these business
users, 5miles is their “online storefront”, and their preferred channel for local marketing.

Furthermore, the CyberMiles could facilitate smart-contracts for key influencers within the
5miles the ecosystem, so as to promote positive experiences they have had with local
businesses. Many 5miles users have hundreds of “followers” on 5miles, and they also have
significant social media presence.

5miles could introduce a user reviews page called “Smiles Experiences” that allows users to
post pictures of products they’ve purchased or interactions they’ve had with businesses in
5miles. CMT could be transferred from the business to the “brand ambassador” based on the
number of views or likes that are generated by the post.

Marketplace “leads” bidding

As a social network centered around local commerce, 5miles is uniquely well-suited to match
supply and demand for goods and services, and CyberMiles’ solutions could fuel the next-
generation of features to better connect “sellers” with the most relevant “buyers”. For
example, we expect many car dealers or auto mechanics would like to reach out to the daily
volume of approximately 12,000 active car buyers on Smiles, and many moving companies
would like to reach out to users buying large furniture.

On traditional marketplaces, sending messages or pop-up notifications to those users may be
intrusive and disruptive. However, a potential solution could be:
e merchants & service providers use CMT to bid to transmit messages
e relevant users receiving messages can choose to accept and view the messages, and
receive a certain allocation of CMT for doing so.

Shared advertising resources

In most existing c2c marketplaces,
items are displayed to the buyers,

As a result of the economic incentives represented by CMT,
users could be more accepting of in-bound inquiries, and
more potential matches between merchants and buyers
could be possible.

the central operating entity sets rules on how the for-sale
and then extract profit by selling advertising space through

auctions. Ina decentralized and community-operated c2c marketplace, the advertising revenue
could be captured by the network itself and shared among the community members. To
illustrate a potential scenario a potential scenario:

e Through a set of smart business contracts, the blockchain network sets up an auction
market for search keywords. Sellers can bid for advertising space for their products, and
the payment in CMT is governed by the smart business contract.

e The smart business contracts that create product lists for decentralized applications
(“Dapps”) prioritize and label advertised items, and the Dapps display them to the
buyers when the buyers are browsing or searching.

e Once the advertisements are displayed, the seller’s CMT payment in the related smart
business contract could either evaporate (as a way to reduce total supply of CMT if the
network has an inflationary policy), or be distributed back to buyers as a form of price

reduction / promotion.

In addition, the token holders could also vote on proposed advertisements to reduce spam and
other problems associated with traditional internet advertising.

¢

Democratic community management

In ac2c marketplace, the most contentious problems are related to centralized management.
For example:

Account closure. In a centralized marketplace, the marketplace operator can
unilaterally close accounts. That could negatively impact the affected sellers and
buyers, as it takes significant of time and monetary investment to build up highly-rated
accounts.

Censorship. The marketplace operator sometimes needs to intervene and remove
illegal products offered for sale (e.g., firearms, or prescription drugs in certain countries
or regions). In a centralized marketplace, the operator makes unilateral decisions. Such
decisions are expensive (as they often require legal expertise and review), create large
potential liabilities, and can even cause resentments in the community if users believe
they have been improperly made.

We strongly support safe and appropriate marketplaces. However, centralization by its nature
concentrates decision-making into a single person or body.

CMT and the CyberMiles blockchain platform, through smart business contracts, could provide
ways for the community to manage and regulate itself. As we described above, the community
can resolve individual conflicts by incentivizing arbiters. However, for issues that go beyond
two transactional parties, we could introduce a voting mechanism that is similar to the “Proof-
of-Stake” (“PoS”) consensus process. This would require the community to come together and
reach consensus on issues related to the management of the whole network. Such consensus
could be reached through the use of smart business contracts. To illustrate a potential
scenario:

A person in the community brings up a request to close an account or censor a product
listing for any reason. This person pledges a specified number of CMT in a smart
business contract when making this request.

The network automatically requests a number of (for example, 100) random token
holders to vote on this issue. Each vote costs a certain amount of CMT depending on
the system setup. The voting results are binary, and a simple majority determines the
outcome.

Depending on the voting result, the initial requester wins or loses the case. And

everyone who casts a vote either prevails or forfeits (that is, according to whether they
voted with or against the majority decision).

cybermiles “
L

y

¢

e The pledged CMT from the initial requester and the payment from each voter is put into
a collection of CMT held by a smart business contract.

e Depending on the outcome, the initial requester could forfeit their pledged CMT (if the
request is voted down), or get back the pledged amount plus an allocation from the
CMT used to cast a vote (if voted in his/her favor). The majority voters get back their
contribution, plus an allocation from the other CMT used to cast votes. The other voters
receive nothing.

A system like this creates incentives for community members to participate in the management
of the network itself. It could be far more effective and cheaper than a centralized system.

5. CyberMiles Beyond 5miles

In the previous section, we discussed CyberMiles blockchain network’s potential applications in
ac2c marketplace. That is the sweet spot of 5miles, and is how Smiles can help the CyberMiles
Foundation jumpstart the network.

However, we aim to make the CyberMiles solutions capable of supporting many kinds of
business transactions beyond the c2c marketplace. As such, the network could provide back
office business transaction services to many types of businesses, especially small businesses.
Through the concept of smart business contracts described in the technical white paper, the
CyberMiles blockchain network could become a leader in the provision of automated / smart
contracts for commercial applications.

The CyberMiles network could act as an outsourced provider of a variety of business services
including IT, finance, customer service, and community management. Building on the Smiles
team’s extensive expertise in business execution, the CyberMiles team has identified the
following major categories of business contracts we could potentially automate.

A decentralized identify management platform

As the Equifax hack demonstrated (personal identify and credit history of over 100 million
Americans were stolen in 2017), centralized personal identity management creates high risk for
consumers and high liability for companies that hold such data. To solve this problem, one must
rethink the whole paradigm of identity management. One obvious solution is to let the user
have full control of her personal information. The user should be able to decide, on a case by
case basis, who have access to her data. The access timing, duration, and accepted use of the
data should all be approved by the user. In this case, there will be no central repository of
personal information to attack. However, without blockchain-based Smart Business Contracts,
such systems are also very hard to implement.

15

cybermiles
L

iy

¢

Blockchain networks manage identities through cryptographic keys. The user’s “wallets” on
bitcoin or Ethereum blockchains are decentralized, and entirely controlled by the user through
her private key. Using Smart Business Contracts, we can extend the concept of “wallets” to
include a secure deposit of not only crypto tokens, but also arbitrary personal information. Like
crypto currency wallets, there could be many “personal identity wallets” on the network. Upon
user’s request (a transaction signed by the user’s private key), the wallet can authorize 3rd
party applications to access the data temporarily via the OAUTH protocol. A user can use
different wallets for different purposes, just like how crypto token wallets are used today.

The workflow and figure below illustrate how an “online wallet” for personal information could
work. This particular “wallet” stores the user’s personal banking information. Hence the user
can authorize financial applications on the CyberMiles network to utilize it. An example is the
peer-to-peer small business lending application illustrated in the next section.

1. The user selects a "wallet" app she trusts.

2. The user registers personal information and banking information with wallet.

3. The wallet does AML / KYC validations for government mandated anti-money laundry
check.

4. The wallet generates a public / private key pair and then broadcasts the public key to
the blockchain for record.

5. The wallet authorizes and tests the banking link.

A peer-to-peer small business loan marketplace

A potential application built on the CyberMiles’ blockchain would be a peer-to-peer small
business loan marketplace. As described in the previous section, we will build a decentralized
identity management platform on CyberMiles. The blockchain can then record the credit
history for each user identified by her public key.

With the identity and credit history, we can build a loan matching engine (the loan “exchange”)
on the blockchain. And once loan terms are matched, the Smart Business Contracts would
automatically settle the loan directly from each party’s bank account using CMT (authorized via
their “personal information wallets”) without a central clearing house. The workflow and figure
below describes how to match and settle a loan.

1. The user logs into the exchange via OAUTH from her wallet. The exchange caches but
not stores personal information.

The user submits her desired loan terms (borrow or lend, term, interest rate).

The exchange suggests matches.

The exchange provides detailed credit scores and histories for matched candidates.
If the user selects a candidate. Both parties would need to agree.

The loan contract is recorded by the exchange and on the blockchain.

The exchange requests the wallets to settle both parties via their bank accounts.

Upon the end of the loan term, when a payment is due, the Smart Business Contract would
automatically execute the following:

1. The exchange requests both party’s wallets to settle payments via their bank accounts.
2. The transaction result is broadcasted to the blockchain, and become part of the credit
history.

A more efficient supply chain

In an e-commerce ecosystem, the seller needs to procure products from suppliers and then
ship to buyers. In the process, the product changes hands multiple times. In a traditional
system, the transactions along the supply chain must be settled using fiat currencies, which
create significant friction and cost.

However, in a token-based system, transactions amongst community members may be
recorded instantly and securely using digital tokens. The parties would only convert any excess
tokens into other assets from time to time on an “as needs basis”, limiting transaction costs.

Addressing the counterfeit problem

Counterfeit products and fraud generally are serious problems in e-commerce marketplaces.
For a centralized operator to address this problem, it must generally review and track every
product listed for sale on the marketplace. That is prohibitively expensive, and probably
ineffective as human reviewers lack the expertise to evaluate the authenticity of all possible
products in a marketplace, even with the assistance of technology that is currently available.
As a result, most centralized marketplaces can only reactively deal with counterfeit products,
creating a “cat and mouse” problem that is common to all centralized systems. A blockchain-
based network can help resolve this problem much more elegantly.

e Proactively: One of the key features of the blockchain is the immutability of its records.
That makes it ideal for tracking the authenticity of for-sale products. Sellers or even
manufacturers / suppliers, can create certificates of authenticity for products. Once the
certificate is associated with recordable features of a product, and relevant information
is stored in a distributed ledger, its ownership can be tracked and the risk of tampering
is significantly reduced. That allows buyers (or even arbiters) to review the entire
history of the product in the system, depending on the information recorded and visible.

e Reactively: As we discussed earlier in this white paper, the CyberMiles blockchain
network provides a mechanism for community-based conflict resolution. That of course
includes the cases where the buyer disagrees on the authenticity of the product. In
disputes alleging fraud, the buyer would need to provide evidence in support of its claim
in order to obtain a favorable decision from the arbiter.

The CyberMiles community can be incentivized to come together and prevent counterfeit
products and frauds on the marketplace.

Automatic escrow

Most current business transactions require trust. The blockchain network’s main feature is its
ability to operate in a trustless environment. For example, one of the primary function of an
Ethereum based smart contract is an escrow to hold and release assets automatically when
certain conditions are met. In many application scenarios outlined in this white paper, the
network would need to hold certain escrow or pledged CMT from multiple parties until a
certain outcome occurs. This level of automation can make escrow much more prevalent and
widely used in our society.

For example, in a sales transaction, the smart business contract could release the CMT in
escrow to the seller when the seller’s shipping carrier sends back a delivery confirmation to the
network. Or the escrow condition may be that when the buyer inspects the product and agrees
to accept it. If the buyer does not accept it, the automated arbitration process begins.

An ICO platform for e-commerce

With a Smart Business Contract platform specifically optimized for e-commerce, and common
data services such as personal identify and credit history on the blockchain, the CyberMiles
blockchain is ideally suited for many types of e-commerce applications. If a blockchain
application is going to be built on CyberMiles blockchain, it will utilize the CMT as its means to
pay for the execution of Smart Business Contracts and settlement of financial transactions. The
application could also issue its own tokens in an Initial Coin Offering to support its own unique
features and community. Just as Ethereum-based applications use the ETH as the basis to issue
ERC20 tokens in ICOs, e-commerce applications could use the CMT as the basis (i.e., master
token) to issue their own ICO tokens.

6. The CyberMiles Foundation

The CyberMiles ecosystem is envisioned to be a community of partners, including blockchain
node operators, validators, service providers, marketplace operators, businesses, and end
users. They could provide or utilize the network services, and exchange CMT on the CyberMiles
platform. The CyberMiles Foundation is intended as an independent, not-for-profit company
that maintains and facilitates democratic governance for the members of this ecosystem. The
CyberMiles Foundation’s mission is:

To decentralize c2c marketplace platforms, and develop blockchain solutions for real-
world and online marketplace applications.

The CyberMiles Foundation has three structural principles:

e Impartiality
o Managed solely to develop CyberMiles blockchain and applications
o Separate legal entity from Smiles and any other member company
o Directors act independently of Smiles, and well-respected within the tech
community

e Not-for-profit governance
o Serves the interests of CMT holders, to develop a robust and scalable system
o Collaboration with 5miles based on arms-length commercial agreements
o Token issuance and distribution managed by the CyberMiles Foundation

e Strong governance
o CyberMiles Foundation is a separate legal entity, with distinct operations and its
own governance framework
o Advised by top-tier professionals
o Implement best practices from other established foundations
o Additional measures in response to regulatory changes and requirements

The principal functions of the CyberMiles Foundation will include:
e Open governance of its resources together with other ecosystem partners;
e Support and advance the technology related to CyberMiles blockchain network’s
implementation; and
e All matters related to ecosystem membership.

The CyberMiles Foundation’s mandate is to grow an open ecosystem of digital services that
consumers can easily explore and find value in, while giving developers an open and sustainable
platform to develop, deliver, and enhance those services and attract users. To fulfill its mission,
the CyberMiles Foundation will dedicate resources to three specific goals related to research,
development, and governance as described below.

¢

A. Governance goals

The Foundation proposes to dedicate resources to establish a fair and transparent governance
process that will take into account the voices and needs of all participants within the
ecosystem. This open governance model would oversee decisions related to the membership
process, participation rules, token issuance, pricing rules, legal matters, and content and
compliance guidelines. The CyberMiles Foundation would be responsible for administering and
overseeing the security of the CMT reserve, as well as transparency in its use of CMT and any
token proceeds.

B. Research goals

The CyberMiles Foundation aims to foster an environment of innovation by working with
partners to test new ways to participate in the ecosystem and drive value creation and network
effects. The CyberMiles Foundation could fund research and development efforts to support an
autonomous network that is secure and effective in providing business transaction services.

C. Development goals

The CyberMiles Foundation proposes to direct and fund the development of the CyberMiles
blockchain itself, as well as tools that give ecosystem partners the ability to build, grow, and
create value for one another. As part of this process, Smiles proposes to make its own
codebase available as an open source project that can be leveraged to power new communities
and add capabilities to existing ones. The CyberMiles Foundation would further this work by
engaging development teams to continue improving the technology suite supporting the
CyberMiles Ecosystem, and will maintain an open source codebase that ecosystem participants
can use.

7. CyberMiles Token Issuance

CMT Token Issuance

The CyberMiles Foundation proposes to initially generate and issue 1 billion CMT, however over
time, this may expand and be capped at 10 billion CMT. Further information about when and
to whom CMT are proposed to be allocated can be found below.

Upon the completion of the proposed CyberMiles token contribution (“Token Contribution”)
for 700 million CMT, there will be a total of 1 billion CMT in circulation.

Token Contribution is proposed to launch soon after incorporation of the CyberMiles
Foundation. For further information and updates regarding the Token Contribution,
prospective participants are invited to provide their email address at http://cm.5miles.com.
Further updates and announcements regarding the timing and the details of the Token
Contribution will be communicated through the website.

Use of Token Contribution proceeds

The proceeds raised from the initial Token Contribution are intended be used for the following
purposes:

1) Fund the development and establishment of the CyberMiles blockchain protocol;

2) Marketing and operating expenses related to the expansion and migration of Smiles’s
platform to the CyberMiles’ blockchain network. Arrangements with 5miles and the
CyberMiles Foundation will be at arms length; and

3) Research and development costs incurred by the CyberMiles Foundation in developing the
CyberMiles platform.

In addition to the hard cap of 700 million tokens to be issued for the Token Contribution, it is
proposed that another 100 million tokens will be pre-allocated to 5miles, in consideration for
its role in establishing the CyberMiles platform and developing the initial ecosystem for CMT.
This will be a key component of a strategic partnership in which 5miles contributes its brand,
technology, and integration of its 10+ million registered users with CyberMiles and CMT. A
further 100 million tokens will be pre-allocated to the CyberMiles team & partners, for
developing the technology & operating the Foundation. The token allocation for both 5miles
and for the CyberMiles team and partners will be subject to a long-term (2.5-year) vesting
period.

A further 100 million CMT are proposed to be held in reserve for future release by the
Foundation to end-users, to jumpstart the use of the CyberMiles applications and to encourage
participation in the ecosystem. The CMT to be distributed is intended spur adoption of various
CyberMiles processes and applications (such as voting on dispute resolution, setting up
CyberMiles wallets, etc.), and completion of Smart Contracts on the CyberMiles chain.

Token Supply Schedule

As transactions occur on the CyberMiles chain and Smart Business Contracts are executed, the
transactions will be processed and validated through a delegated-PoS (“D-PoS”) consensus
engine system, and will result in newly minted tokens to incentivize & compensate the network
participants. The mechanisms for the D-PoS engine are in-development, but the CyberMiles
Foundation will target an eight-percent (8%) compounded annual increase in the total number
of tokens, from the close of the Token Contribution Event, until the 10“ year anniversary. Upon
the 10* anniversary of the Token Contribution Event, the Foundation will decide, based on the
development of the CyberMiles ecosystem and with input from the community, on the targeted
growth in the token supply for subsequent years. Regardless, the Foundation is proposing a
long-term cap of 10 billion tokens as the maximum number of CMT tokens that can be issued
and circulated.

Inflation Schedule

As discussed above, the delegated-PoS (Proof of Stake) mechanisms will be developed to effect
the targeted outcome of 8% annual increase in total number of tokens, until the 10"
anniversary of the close of the Token Contribution Event. Below is the targeted inflation
schedule for the active supply of tokens:

HAVEN

A decentralised payment network and stablecoin
v0.8

Samuel Brooks, Anton Jurisevic, Michael Spain, Kain Warwick

Abstract

There is currently no decentralised currency useful for everyday economic
purposes. We propose a peer-to-peer payment network and price-stable
token that does not rely on a central authority to maintain trust. Prior
to Bitcoin, attempts to create digital currencies were centralised, making
them vulnerable to censorship and seizure. Bitcoin’s consensus mecha-
nism protected it from interference, but its fixed monetary policy induced
extreme price volatility. Havven solves this by issuing tokens against a
distributed collateral pool, which derives its value from fees levied on
transactions. Growth in transaction volume thus increases the value of
the collateral, allowing the token supply to expand to meet demand. The
resulting system retains the best features of Bitcoin, while the introduction
of price stability results in a superior form of money.

1 Introduction

1.1 Payment Networks

Payment networks are closed systems within which users can transfer value.
Such systems include credit card networks, the SWIFT network, and PayPal.
Proprietors of these networks possess absolute control over the value within the
network, so any transaction conducted within them may be blocked or reversed
at any time. Although this is ostensibly designed to protect users, it introduces
systemic risk for all participants. If the network is compromised or its owners
cease to behave benevolently, no party can trust that the value in their account
is secure or accessible.

In a traditional payment network like American Express, participants trust that
the fees charged are sufficient to service the expenses incurred. However, were
this trust to disappear, merchants would refuse to participate. Thus, the value of
the unit of account within this network is derived solely from a single entity and
the trust that participants have in that entity. As a result, the viability of any
centralised payment network depends on complete trust in a central authority.

Bitcoin solved these problems by ensuring that users have sole discretion over the
money in their account by producing a trustless, permissionless payment network
in which anyone could participate at will. Since users could enter and exit the
system at any time without being exposed to the aforementioned risks, adoption
was accelerated, and network effects were amplified. Programmable blockchains
allow the logic of a payment network to be decentralised in a transparent way, en-
abling anyone to verify whether the network is solvent. This eliminates systemic
risk and reduces the costs associated with centralised networks.

1.2 Cryptocurrency

The technology of money has three key functions: to act as a unit of account, a
medium of exchange and a store of value. As payment technology has advanced
in recent years, money has become increasingly invisible and it is often lost
upon its users that, like any technology, it can be improved. Bitcoin and other
cryptocurrencies represent an impressive technological advancement on existing
forms of money because they deliver improved durability, portability, and di-
visibility. Further, they do so without requiring centralised control or sovereign
enforcement from which to derive their value. Their fixed monetary policies have
protected them from debasement and devaluation, allowing them to outperform
other forms of money as a store of value. However, this has created the potential
for short-run volatility as they lack mechanisms to dynamically adjust supply
to changing demand. Bitcoin has thus tended to be a poor medium of exchange
and an even worse unit of account. In order for a token to effectively act as
money its purchasing power must remain stable against goods and services over
the short to medium term.
1.3. Stablecoins

Cryptocurrencies exhibit transaction immutability and censorship resistance, and
in these ways are a better form of money; but their adoption has been hindered
by the volatility inherent in their static monetary policies. Users cannot engage
with such systems as a medium of exchange if the purchasing power fluctuates.
Stability continues to be one of the most valuable yet elusive characteristics for
the technology.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed for price stability. They should ideally
be as effective at making payments as fiat currencies like the US Dollar, while
retaining their other desirable properties. A decentralised payment network built
on a stablecoin would be able to capture all the benefits of a permissionless sys-
tem, while also eliminating volatility. One approach to achieving price stability
is to produce a token whose price targets the value of a fiat currency. Targeting

stability against fiat currencies obviates the need to respond to macroeconomic
conditions, as the token then benefits from the stabilisation efforts of large insti-
tutions acting in fiat markets. Furthermore, if a token’s price can be maintained
at $1, then it can serve as an interface between fiat money and cryptocurrency.
If such a stablecoin does not require an account in a traditional bank, then it
can be effectively used for settlement and purchasing, without the centralisation
and counterparty risk involved in fiat transactions. Thus it can be expected that
by using stablecoins, exchanges that trade fiat for crypto will be able to rapidly
reduce their transactional costs, reducing the barriers for new users to enter the
market.

1.4 Distributed Collateral

Today’s fiat money is not backed by an asset; its stability is derived from the
authority of the governments which issue it. These governments require that tax
obligations are denominated in the currencies they control, which are then use
to fund active stabilisation efforts. However, with government control comes the
risk of tyranny and debasement. Decentralised monetary systems don’t have
these powers, and so they must use collateral to provide confidence in the value
of their tokens. A decentralised system cannot use collateral assets that exis
outside the blockchain, as interfacing with these assets necessitates centralisation
with the aforementioned failure modes. Meanwhile, cryptoasset prices have been
lominated by speculative volatility. So whether a system uses real-world assets
or cryptoassets to back a stable token, if the value of the collateral is uncorrelated
with the demand for the token, then the system is vulnerable to external price

shocks. Large corrections can destroy the value of collateral without any change
in the demand for the token issued against it. Clearly then, in designing an
asset-backed stablecoin it is important to select the collateral asset carefully, bu
no existing asset perfectly serves the purpose.

1.5 Havven

Havven is a decentralised payment network where users transact directly in a
price-stable cryptocurrency. Those who use the stablecoin pay fees to those who
collateralise the network, compensating them for the risks of providing collat-
eral and stability. Collateral providers control the money supply, and fees are
distributed in proportion with each individual’s stabilisation performance. Thus,
Havven rewards suppliers of stability and charges those who demand it.

Havven implements two linked tokens to achieve this structure:

Nomin
The stablecoin, whose supply floats. Its price as measured in fiat currency should
be stable. This token is useful insofar as it provides a superior medium of
exchange. Thus in addition to price stability, Havven should encourage adequate
nomin liquidity.

Havven

This token provides the collateral for the system and has a static supply. Its mar-
ket capitalisation reflects the system’s aggregate value. Ownership of havvens
grants the right to issue a value of nomins proportional to the dollar value of

havvens placed into escrow. If a user wishes to release their escrowed havvens,
they must first present the system with the quantity of nomins previously issued!.

The havven token is a novel decentralised asset, whose intrinsic value is derived
from the fees generated in the network it collateralises. This enables a form o:
representative money in which there is no requirement for a physical asset, thus
removing the problems of trust and custodianship. Issuance of nomins requires a
greater value of havvens to be escrowed in the system, providing confidence tha‘
nomins can be redeemed for their face value even if the price of havvens falls.
The system incentivises the issuance and destruction of nomins in response to
changes in demand, but ultimately the intrinsic value of the havvens will reflec
the required nomin supply. Backing a stablecoin in this way provides full trans-
parency over how many tokens have been issued against the available collateral.
This provides a solid basis for confidence in the solvency of the payment network
built upon it.

Denominating the value of the nomin in an external fiat currency means that
stability is relative only to that currency. Initially this currency will be the
US dollar, and this is the target currency used throughout this paper, but in
the future the system will support additional flavours of stablecoin that are
denominated in other currencies.

Following Bitcoin, the Havven system will appear in uppercase and singular; while the
havven token will be lowercase and may be plural.

w
2 System Description

Havven is a dual-token system that, combined with a set of novel incentive mech-
anisms, stabilises the price of the nomin with respect to an external asset. Users
of the nomin token pay the owners of the havven token for collateralising and
stabilising the system.

The havven token incentivises those who hold it to fulfil two functions:

- To provide the system with collateral.

+ To participate in the stabilisation of the nomin price.

Collateralisation

Confidence in the stability of the nomin begins with overcollateralisation, so
that the value of escrowed havvens is greater than the value of nomins in circu-
lation. As long as the ratio of total nomin value to total havven value remains
favourable, there is sufficient backing in the underlying collateral pool to ensure
that nomins can be redeemed for their face value. The redeemability of a nomin
for the havvens against which it was issued strongly supports a stable price.

Stabilisation Incentives

Havven rewards those that have issued nomins. These rewards are derived from
transaction fees and are distributed in proportion with how effectively each issuer
acts to maintain the correct nomin supply. The system monitors the nomin price,
and responds by adjusting its targeted global supply, which individual issuers
are incentivised to move towards.

Where volatility persists, stronger stabilisation mechanisms may be applied, for
example automated collateral recovery. Where a significant portion of nomins
are being used for hedging, (and hence not generating transaction fees) a charge
can be applied to ensure that the cost of utility for hedging is not being solely
borne by transactions.

2.1 Equilibrium Nomin Price

We first introduce the core system variables:

HT havven quantity N nomin quantity

P;, havven price P,, nomin price

All havven tokens are created at initialisation, so H is constant. The quantity of
nomins floats, responding to the issuance actions of havven holders. The Havven
system needs to incentivise issuers to maintain N such that the nomin price Py,
is stable at $1. As we proceed, we may subscript variables with t to indicate
the value of that variable at a given time. Any variable lacking such a subscript
indicates the value of the quantity it represents at the current time.

In Havven, the measure of the value of nomins against the value of havvens is
called the collateralisation ratio:
P,+N

C= DoH

()

From the law of supply and demand, at a given level of demand, there exists
some supply of nomins N* which yields an equilibrium price of $1. This quan-
tity is associated with an ideal collateralisation ratio at a parca havven
price Cp, which is achieved when N = N*. Therefore, when C = C5, , = $1.
We visualise this equilibrium below with hypothetical demand and sari curves.

Pr

We assume that some level of demand exists given the utility of nomins as a stable
cryptocurrency. Although the organic supply and demand for nomins cannot be
easily manipulated, all issuance is controlled by havven holders, whose incentives
are in turn controlled by the system. It follows that as we require a fixed price
P,, = $1 and are unable to control either P;, or H, we must incentivise havven
holders to manipulate N, and therefore C, in order to satisfy our requirement.

2.2 Issuance and Collateralisation

Havven’s goal is to stabilise the nomin price while remaining overcollateralised.
In order to do so, the system defines a collateralisation target:

0< Cont <1 (2)

Copt is implicitly closer to Cp, than C is; when C approaches Copr, it also ap-
proaches C4, .

It is necessary at this point to distinguish for an account 7 the nomins it contains
N; (equity) from the nomins it has issued N; (debt). Note that globally, Mi =
Nj, as all nomins were issued by some account. However, a given account
may have a balance different from its issuance debt. Hence we can define the
collateralisation ratio for an individual account 7 in terms of its issuance debt:

P,,- N;

CO Poe, (3)

The system provides incentives for individual issuers to bring their C; closer to
Copt While maintaining Cp; itself at a level that stabilises the price. As each C;
targets Copr, the overall collateralisation ratio does also.

Nomin Issuance

The nomin issuance mechanism allows Havven to reach its collateralisation target.
Issuing nomins escrows some quantity of havvens, which cannot be moved until
they are unescrowed. The quantity of havvens H; locked in generating N; nomins
is:

- P,,-N;
a — 2a 4
"Py Cmax (4)

Under equilibrium conditions, there is some Hy; < H; when C; coincides with
Copt, Which the issuer is incentivised to target. These incentives are provided
in the form of transaction fees, discussed in section 2.4. It is important to note
that the issuer may voluntarily increase their C; up to the limit of Cyax; for
example if they anticipate a positive movement in Copz.
On the other hand, no one may issue a quantity of nomins that would lock more
than H; havvens. Consequently, C; may never exceed Cmax, except by price
fluctuations, and in such circumstances, issuers are rewarded for bringing C;
back under Cynax-

After generating the nomins, the system places a limit sell order with a price of
$1 on a decentralised exchange. This means that the nomins will be sold at the
current market price, down to a minimum price of $1. If we assume implemen-
tation on Ethereum, then the nomins are sold for an equivalent value in ether,
with the proceeds of the sale remitted to the issuer.

Nomin Destruction

In order to access the havvens that have been escrowed, the system must destroy
the same number of nomins that were originally issued. When the issuer indicates
the intention to retrieve their havvens, the system places a limit buy order on
a decentralised exchange, up to a maximum price of $1. The system places this
order on behalf of the issuer and upon completion, the nomins are immediately
destroyed.
2.3 Collateralisation Ratio
2.3.1 Optimal Collateralisation Ratio

The optimal collateralisation ratio Cop; is a target for havven holders to reach
which brings the global C' closer to Cp, . If havven holders target Cop; effectively,
the amount of fees they receive is maximised.

Copt is defined as a positive function of P,, such that its value directly tracks
changes in the nomin price; a havven holder wishing to maximise their fees will
target Cop: by issuing or destroying nomins to manipulate their individual C;.

The function for C,,, given below provides our dynamic target for havven holders
based on the price of nomins:

Copt = F(Pa)+C
f(Pa) = max(a-(P, — 1) +1,0)

go price sensitivity parameter (a > 0)

(5)

y flattening parameter (i € N, 7 { 2)

f(Pn)

When P,, is at $1, no signal is available to suggest that the global nomin supply
is incorrect. In this case Cop, = C and no incentive exists to move away from
current collateralisation levels. However, if P,, < $1, nomin supply outstrips de-
mand; then Cop, < C, which encourages issuers to burn nomins, thereby raising
the price. This movement of Cop: reflects the fact that Cp, < C under these
circumstances. The P,, > $1 case is symmetric.
Notice that when the P,, is close to $1, f’(P,) is small, so that Havven does
not overshoot the correct nomin supply. However, the further it diverges from
$1, the larger the slope becomes, providing a stronger fee incentive for a havven
holder to move toward Cop,.

2.3.2 Maximum Collateralisation Ratio

Havven seeks to maintain C < Cop: < Cmax < 1, in order to retain sufficient
havven collateral. It might seem intuitive that Cmax should be a static value.
However, since C,,; varies linearly with P, and inversely with P,, there are
situations where Cynax may need to change. We allow that a user may wish to
set their C; > Cmax, but constrain by how much they may do so.

Below we define Caz in terms of Cope.

Cmax = a: Copt .
7 (6)
a>1
The value of Cmax determines how much collateral each nomin is issued against.
The higher it is, the more nomins can be generated for the same value of havvens.
By contrast, if Cmaz is low, the system has a greater capacity to absorb nega-
tive shocks in the havven price before it becomes undercollateralised. The value
of Cmax therefore represents a tradeoff between efficiency and resilience. By
defining Cynaxz as a function of C,,,, Havven finds the optimal balance in this
dilemma. This ensures that like Cop:, Cmax only changes as a consequence of
instability in the nomin price.

It should be noted that Cinaxz > 1 corresponds to a fractional reserve monetary
system, where a greater value of nomins can be issued against each havven. In
Havven, this situation is unsustainable because it would cause simultaneous
appreciation of havvens (up to at least the value of nomins issuable against a
havven) and depreciation of nomins, immediately diminishing C, Cop: and Caz,
bringing them back under 1.
2.4 Transaction Fees

Havven needs a direct incentive mechanism that can correct the global collater-
alisation ratio, C’, in response to changes in the price of havvens or nomins. In
order to target the correct price, the system adjusts the fees it pays to havven
holders according to their effectiveness in stabilising the nomin price.

2.4.1 Fees Received by Havven Holders

The fee rate received by a havven holder that has escrowed havvens is ¢,,;. The
actual fee they receive is H; - ¢,,;, being proportional with their havven balance.
This rate changes with respect to their unique collateralisation ratio, C;. It in-
creases linearly to a maximum @yase at the optimal collateralisation ratio Cop,,
before quickly diminishing as C; approaches the maximum collateralisation ratio

Cmaz-

This function is designed to encourage havven holders to constantly target the
optimal collateralisation ratio, by rewarding them with greater fees if they bring
their C; into alignment with Cop.

2.4.2 Nomin Transaction Fees

Every time a nomin transaction occurs, the Havven system charges a small
transaction fee. Transaction fees allow the system to generate revenue, which it
can distribute to havven holders as an incentive to move the circulating nomin
supply towards N*.

The fee rate charged on nomin transactions is ¢,. It is constant and will be
sufficiently small that it provides little to no friction for the user. We may then
express the total fees collected in a period, F’, as a function of the velocity of
nomins v and the total nomin supply N:

F=v-¢:N (9)

2.4.3 Base Fee Rate

Let us define the total fees received by havven holders F;.:
Fo = OM bri (10)

Havven requires that the total fees collected from users has to be equal to the
total amount of fees paid to the havven holders in the following period, so that
F,.. = F,_1. Substituting our earlier definition (7) for ¢,,; and solving for dbase:

Fai

= 11
Yi Ait Tia (4)

Pbaset =

We have now defined the maximum fee rate, dpase, in terms of the fees collected,
F. This rate should be achieved when an individual’s C; was at Cop; in the
previous period.

The definition of Cy», therefore provides the following incentive. If P, > $1

then the system encourages more nomins to be issued. However, if P,, < $1, the
system encourages nomins to be burned.

3 System Analysis

3.1  Nomin Demand and Havven Value

Being freely-tradable tokens, havvens will have a market price which, like the
nomin price, can be measured with an oracle. Initially, while nomin demand is
low, a seven day rolling average of the market price will be used for both havvens
and nomins. This rolling average is designed to smooth out fluctuations in the
market price and increase the cost of attacking the system.

However, once nomin transaction volume is sufficiently high, we may instead
estimate the value of a havven by the fees it is likely to accrue. This value,
which implicitly measures nomin volume, would allow issuance incentives to
directly reflect changes in nomin demand. By using this value instead of the
havven market price, the system can avoid the influence of speculation, since
the permitted nomin supply would expand and contract in line with actual usage.

While the system cannot perfectly determine future fee returns and hence nomin
demand, it is possible to estimate as a function of the transaction fees that the
system has recently generated. This computation is designed not to be vulnerable
to instantaneous volume spikes, while taking the most recent transaction volumes
to be the most highly-correlated with future volumes:

t

v= y- Frew: Fat-t (12)
fa..-—CO(1 +r)

with
V, the system’s valuation of a havven at period t
F, the total fees collected in period t
Py. the nomin price at period t

ra falloff term

This can be computed efficiently, because Viz. = He PeP en Further, for large

enough t, if it is assumed that P,, + $1 and that current fees are close to future
ones, so that F, ~ Fy, t < t’, then:

oo

Fr Fr
\a~) ——j{ = 13
f »~ Gan eo (13)

Consequently, Fa approximates the number of periods for a havven to yield a fee
return of V;. A judicious choice of r can then yield a V; which underestimates
the market price of havvens (which also incorporates, for example, capital gains),
while not unduly constraining nomin supply.

12
3.2 Fee Evasion

Being a set of smart contracts, Havven is potentially vulnerable to the wrapping
of its tokens being by another smart contract. Such a smart contract would
take deposits of nomins, and replicate all nomin functionality on redeemable
IOU tokens it issues. These wrapped tokens could then be exchanged without
incurring fees. We consider this situation unlikely for a number of reasons.

First, the fees are designed to be low enough that most users shouldn’t notice
them, so they will not in general be strongly motivated to switch to a marginal
and less trustworthy alternative. Additionally, transfer fees will still be charged
upon deposit into and withdrawal from token-wrapping contracts, which partly
constrains the utility of the wrapper.

Second, network effects are tremendously important for currencies; in order to
have utility a token must be accepted for exchange in the marketplace. This is
challenging enough in itself, but a wrapped token must do this to the extent
that it displaces its own perfect substitute: the token it wraps. In Havven’s case,
this would undermine its built-in stabilisation mechanisms, which become more
powerful with increased transaction volume. Consequently, as a wrapped nomin
parasitises more of the nomin market, it destroys the basis of its own utility,
which is that nomins themselves are stable.

Finally, it is unlikely that a token wrapper will be credible, not having been
publicly and expensively audited, while its primary function undermines the
trustworthiness of its authors.

Even as token wrapping may appear unlikely to the authors, there are at least
two remedies which can be instituted to resolve this.

It would be a simple matter to implement a democratic remedy, weighted by
havven balance, by which havven holders can freeze or confiscate the balance
of any contract that wraps assets. Those havven holders are incentivised not to
abuse this system for the same reason that bitcoin mining pools do not form
cartels to double-spend: because abuse of this power would undermine the value
of the system, and thus devalue their own holdings.

The credible threat of such a system existing is enough to discourage token
wrappers from being used, even if they are written, since any user who does so
risks losing their entire wrapped balance.

An alternative solution is to institute a hedging fee, charged on static nomin
balances. Such a fee could be discounted against transfer fees so that it encourages
general token velocity, and imposes a cost on those who buy nomins simply in
order to hedge, and are thus a risk for the network. Under this model, a token
wrapper would not dodge this fee: the full balance that was wrapped will not be
available at the time of unwrapping.

13
3.3 Issuance Case Study

In this section we illustrate how Havven’s incentives encourage havven holders
to maintain stability.

In 3.3.1, we first present a simplified example the practical issuance dynamics for
a havven holder, Bob, if he targets C.p;. In the second part, 3.3.2, we examine
the optimality of following this strategy with a more sophisticated model of the
mechanism as a two-player game.

It should be noted that these are simply illustrative examples to give the reader
a feel for the nature of the system’s issuance dynamics. This section is partly an
adaptation of the calibrated analysis results presented in much greater depth in
as part of the economic analysis of Havven performed by cryptecon, which can
be found in its entirety here.

The cryptecon investigation concluded that the Havven system generally sta-
bilises the nomin price at $1, but most of the supporting apparatus has been
omitted in this white paper. Therefore, an interested reader should consult that
reference for further details and an explanation of the assumptions which underly
its results.

Throughout this section we will assume implementation upon Ethereuem, there-

fore in this example, the system will buy and sell nomins in exchange for ether,
but this could be substituted with any asset tradeable in a decentralised way.

14
3.3.1 Practical Issuance Dynamics

Initial Conditions

Bob decides to purchase 100 havvens at $1 each. The system is in price equilib-
rium, with the global collateralisation ratio C equal to the optimal collaterali-
sation ratio Cop. We will denote Bob’s personal H and C; with Hp p and Chop.
The initial conditions are then as follows:

Cmax = 0.5 Copt = 0.4 C=04
P,=1 P,=1 Hyon = 100

The internal parameters of Cop; and Cmax, as described in section 2.3, will remain
constant throughout the example:

o =50 ~=3 a=1.25

Initially, Bob’s wallet contains only free havvens, but he wants to earn the
maximum possible fees, so he issues nomins up to Cop¢. The system generates 40
nomins and escrows 80 of his havvens, locking $80 worth of value in the system.
The nomins are sold for $40 worth of ether and the proceeds are transferred to
Bob’s account.

FREE ESCROWED

We now proceed to examine the respective consequences for Bob of nomin and
havven price shocks.

15
Nomin Price Shock

This example shows how the system incentivises havven holders to correct insta-
bility in the nomin price.

1.

As a consequence of reduced demand in decentralised trading markets, the
nomin price P, drops to $0.90. The system needs to incentivise havven
holders to reduce the supply of nomins so that the price returns to $1.00.

First, consider that both C and C;,» have decreased to 0.36. Since the
nomin price has changed, Cy); is recalculated to 0.342, which is smaller
than both Cy.» and C. Consequently, Cmax also changes to 0.4275. This
increases the percentage of Bob’s havvens that are locked.

FREE ESCROWED

$40 ETH

. Bob now has a higher dollar value of locked havvens and Cy.» > Copz. This

means that he is no longer receiving the maximum fee rate pase. In order
to return to @pase he must lower Cyo4 back to Cop, by burning some nomins.
He needs to work out how many to burn.

. He should burn 2 nomins so that he has 38 total issued, which will cost

$1.80. When the system completes this process, his locked havvens will
reduce back to 80. In addition, Cp.» is equal to Cop; at 0.342, which means
he is once again receiving the maximum fee rate.

FREE ESCROWED

$38.20 ETH

. Bob has taken the correct actions to raise the low nomin price. By electing

to burn nomins, the system performed a limit buy order on his behalf,
putting upward pressure on the nomin price. As compensation for doing
so, he is rewarded with the optimal fee rate dpase-

16
Havven Price Shock (Market Price)

This example illustrates how the system maintains the dollar value of the under-
lying collateral by adjusting the quantity of a user’s escrowed havvens when the
havven price changes. We will use the same initial conditions as in the previous
example.

1. As before, Bob elects to issue up to Cop; in order to maximise fees.

FREE ESCROWED

‘$40 ETH

2. The havven price P;, drops to $0.90, which means the value of Bob’s wallet
has decreased to $90. Both C and Cj,» have increased to 0.44. Since the
nomin price has not changed, the system does not need to incentivise
issuance or burning. This is reflected in the new value of Cop, which
changes to 0.44, matching C and Cpoy.

3. However, the system needs to escrow more of Bob’s havvens to maintain
the dollar value of the locked collateral. The system has now locked around
89% of Bob’s havvens, to maintain $80 of locked collateral.

3.3.2 Optimality of Targeting C.,,

We will now examine the correct action for players to respond to changes in
the nomin price. The game begins in an equilibrium condition, with all players
holding issuance levels matching the optimal level.

For simplicity, we consider a system which has only two havven holders. We lose
no generality here, as a collection of actors behaving together can be considered
as one agent. The sets of agents we consider are those those havven holders who
do and do not respond to nomin price shocks by matching their aggregated C;
to Copt as it changes, which is motivated by the monotonicity of the fee function
(7) on either side of its maximum.

One player is assumed to own fewer havvens than the other. If this is not the
case, then in reality it soon will be if one strategy player’s strategy is more
profitable than the other’s.

We will examine each of the four cases describing how each player can act, and
show that the correct action is for each player to target Cope.

Initial Conditions and Definitions
We denote the fraction of e-commerce transactions using nomins with e-GDP
and assume the following inverse demand function for the nomin price:

e-GDP,

Pat =
, ur: Nt

The expected profit of a havven holder i at period t, with respect to fees and
their issuance actions can be expressed as follows:

Fin

Tit = Orit * + (Ni — Nit-1)- Pre

The first havven holder owns 100 havvens and has issued 50 nomins. The second
owns 200 havvens and has issued 100 nomins. Neither havven holder buys or
sells havvens:

H = 300 Hy, = 100 Hy = 200
N_, = 150 Ni,-1 = 50 No,-1 = 100

The transaction fee rate (¢,), interest rate (r) and velocity (v) are fixed through-
out:

be = 0.2% r=0.6% v=6

18
The values of the price sensitivity parameter (c), the flattening parameter (1)
and the Cjnaz multiplier (a) are:

a =50 w=3 a= 1.25

To evaluate P,,1 we assume that ¢-GDP_, = 900. We can now also evaluate
Ph,-1 and the initial issuance ratios:

Pri-1 Pri-1 Cy Cy-1 C2,-1 f(Pa,-1)| Copt,-1 | Cmax,—1
1 1 0.5 0.5 0.5 1 0.5 0.625
Table 1: Prices and collateralisation; t = —1

The number of escrowed havvens for each havven holder is given by equation
(4). We can also evaluate their expected profits:

Ay; = 80 ™,-1 = 100
Hp, = 160 T2,-1 = 200

At the beginning of period t = 0, there is a 10% decrease in ¢- GDP causing the
nomin price P,, to decrease from $1 to $0.90, but neither player has yet reacted
to the situation:

Pro Pro Co Cio C20 f(Pno)| Copto | Cmaz,o
0.9 0.9 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.905 0.4525 | 0.5656

Table 2: Negative shock; no reaction; t = 0

We now consider all possible combinations of actions in turn. Either one, neither,
or each player will react to bring their own issuance levels into line with Cop.
We examine the resulting expected profit for each player in each situation and
show that the correct action for both players is to do so.

19
Neither Havven Holder Reacts

If neither havven holder changes N; then P,, will remain at $0.90. Altough for
both havven holders ¢,.;1 < @pase,1, their expected profits remain the same.
This is because they have the same fee rate, all fees must be distributed and
collectively they own all havvens. However, their number of locked havvens has
increased:

Ni. = 50 Fy = 88.4 ™,1 = 100
No.1 = 100 Hy = 176.8 12,1 = 200

Both Havven Holders React

Instead of remaining idle, each havven holder has an opportunity to increase
gra by changing N; to align with Cop1,0:
Copt,o* Po Hi

Pro

If both havven holders target Cop:, their new nomin balances, locked havvens
and expected profits are:

Nia =

Ni = 45.25 F114 = 80 1,1 = 86.22
No.1 = 90.5 Hy = 160 9,1 = 172.45

Due to their actions, the nomin price, Phi ~ 1, f(Pna) ¥ 1 and Copia & C1.
There is no further incentive for either havven holder to change N;. They also
have reduced H; to the level it was originally:

Pra Pra Ci Cia C21 f (Pra) Copta_| Cmax,
0.9945 | 0.9 0.500 0.500 0.500 0.999 0.499 0.625

Table 3: Negative shock; both react; t = 1

Havven Holder 1 Reacts
We now consider the scenario in which only the first havven holder changes Nj.

We show the payoffs for each havven holder after 6 iterations. Havven holder 1
improves his profit at the expense of havven holder 2:

Ni¢ = 46.57 Hi¢ = 80 71,6 = 118.53
No = 100 Ho = 171.77 0,6 = 171.58

20
P,, stabilises around $0.92 instead of $1. The reason being that, although P,, 4 1,
C16 = Copt,e- This means that havven holder 1 has no further incentive to change
Ni:

Pre Pre Ce Creé C26 f (Pre) Copt,e | Cmac,6
0.921 0.9 0.500 0.477 0.512 0.953 0.477 0.596

Table 4: Negative shock; havven holder 1 reacts; t = 6
Havven Holder 2 Reacts
Finally, we consider the case in which only havven holder 2 changes No:

Ni6 = 50 Hy 6 = 85.31 1,6 = 77.25
Noo = 93.78 Hy = 160 12,6 = 204.90

In this case, havven holder 2 improves his profit at the expense of havven holder
1. Again, P,, does not stabilise at $1 but does stabilise closer to $1 than in the
previous scenario, since havven holder 2 has a larger fraction of N:

Pus Pre C6 Cie C26 f(Pne)| Conte | Cmaz,6
0.939 0.9 0.500 0.522 0.489 0.978 0.489 0.612

Table 5: Negative shock; havven holder 2 reacts; t = 6

Nash Equilibrium

Both havven holders are best off by changing N; to align with C,,;. Although for
each of them the best scenario would be if the other does not do anything, this
scenario cannot be an equilibrium. This can be seen from the following strategic
game representation of the previous analysis (for this representation, we assume
that all iterations are made instantaneously and simultaneously by both havven
holders).

N2,0 Nz
Nio | (100, 200) (77.25, 204.9)
Nz | (118.53, 171.58) | (86.21, 172.43)

Table 6: Negative shock; strategic game representation

N;,o is the action of maintaining the same number of nomins taken by holder 7,

whereas N;* is the action of changing their nomin issuance. Each box has the

21
payoff that both holders get by choosing some particular action. For example, if
havven holder 1 chooses Nj9 and holder 2 chooses N2,0, the former gets a payoff
of 100 and the latter 200. It can be seen that havven holder 1 will choose Ny# no
matter what action is chosen by havven holder 2 (1 gets larger payoffs following
N} for any action that 2 can take). Similarly, 2 will choose Nj no matter what
the action of havven holder 1 is. In other words, action N;* strictly dominates

remaining idle with Nj,9. Therefore, {Nj}, N3} is the unique Nash equilibrium.
Other Conditions

Note that the expected profit for each player decreases in the case of a negative
price adjustment. This is due to the fact that the players must buy back nomins
from the market. Yet this analysis does not take into account the profit obtained
by later selling those nomins in the case of a positive price adjustment.

The analysis for an isolated positive correction is similar to that for a negative
one, but since nomins are being issued rather than burnt, the nash equilibrium
profits strictly increase versus the "do nothing" scenario. A table similar to the
one above can be constructed for the case of a positive price shock:

N20 Nz
Mio | (00, 200) | (100, 218.5)
Ny | (110.2, 200) | (114.7, 229.5)

Table 7: Positive shock; strategic game representation

In both cases the expected profit is positive; note that a balanced sequence of
positive and negative price shocks yields a positive expected profit. Thus in a
steady state havven holders should be able to profitably stabilise the system,
and absorb modest decreases in aggregate nomin demand.

Appendices

A Road Map

The Havven system will be released in phases, described in the following sections.
This phased rollout accelerates market penetration while allowing features to be
introduced and monitored incrementally. The intended approach is to decentralise
Havven as it is built, which will be accompanied by a gradual increase in the
issuance ratio while the system develops. This provides a balance of safety and
functionality until Havven is fully mature.

System B: Dynamic Market Issuance Q3
System C: Multi-Currency Nomins Q4

A.1  Ether-Backed Nomins (eUSD)

The ether-backed nomin system implements eUSD, an interim stablecoin which
is designed to enable data collection to determine the parameters necessary for
the havven-backed nUSD system. Price stability is maintained by a pool of ether
which backs the circulating stablecoin supply. In this system, eUSD can be pur-
chased from and sold into a pool for $1 worth of ether. The Havven foundation
provides at least $2 of ether collateral for each issued eUSD, which ensures that
the entire supply is redeemable for its face value even in the face of the ether
price falling by up to two thirds. Fees are collected on transactions, and these
fees are collected by havven owners.

The eUSD system, being based on ether collateral, has a constrained maximum

supply. Therefore, in order to scale, the system must move towards its ultimate
issuance mechanism, where nomins are backed with havvens.

23
A.2 Havven-Backed Nomins (nUSD)

System A Static Foundation Issuance

The System A version of nUSD allows issuance of nomins against the value of
havvens up to a static ratio, which is set by the Havven foundation. nUSD will be
created directly in the issuer’s wallet, and fees paid proportionally with the num-
ber of issued nomins per user. Given that it’s necessary to encourage liquidity,
but not all the mechanisms outlined in this paper will be operating yet, issuance
will be by the foundation itself, and potentially other white-listed addresses it
trusts. In this way, the stability of the token is maintained by direct market
intervention by the foundation.

As System A fundamentally changes the issuance mechanics, nUSD is a distinct
token from eUSD, even though both target a price of $1. At the time of the nUSD
launch, the eUSD contract will enter a liquidation period, when eUSD can be
sold back to the contract. At the conclusion of this period, the contract will be
destroyed. Future updates to the Havven system will not entail the destruction
of any nomin tokens; thus both havvens and nUSD will persist without further
interruption.

System A limits issuance so that only those havvens the foundation controls can
be used to back nomins, which means the full value of the havven network can-
not be deployed for issuance. At this stage the market will be monitored closely
by the Havven foundation, and the issuance ratio maintained at a low level or
gradually increased to allow for expansion of the nUSD supply. This version of
the system is constrained while the remaining system parameters described in
this paper are finalised. Since nomins are created directly in the issuer’s wallet,
liquidity may be limited if issuers choose not to sell those nomins, which would
be counterproductive to the general goal of stability. Systems B aims to combat
such limitations.

System B Dynamic Market Issuance

System B composes the complete mechanism as described in the main body of
this paper. The incentives will be activated so that users earn fees in accordance
with how effectively they stabilise the nomin price. System B will enforce that
issuance occurs through an issuance controller or decentralised exchange to
ensure that new liquidity is injected directly into the market at $1 per nomin.
The Havven system must manage open issue/burn orders while also continually
updating the price at which they are offered.

These elements being in place, market players are encouraged to behave cor-
rectly. Thus, this phase opens up the opportunity for anyone to engaging in
the issuance process. With the intended mechanisms operational, any cap on
the ultimate scale of the Havven system is effectively removed, and the most

24
important remaining task is stimulating demand for nomins.

System C Multi-Currency Nomins

One means of increasing usage of nomins is offering it denominated against a
variety of different currencies. In principle, the Havven mechanism can target the
price of any asset. With this in mind, the foundation intends to allow issuance
of different flavours of nomins. For example, in addition to nUSD, the system
could also allow nKRW to be issued, tracking the price of the Korean won. In
such a system, issuers would be rewarded with fees only for currencies they have
issued. This extension would replicate the Havven mechanism for each currency.
If such issuance occurs against the same collateral pool, it is straightforward
to see that in the absence of other incentives, the issued supply of each nomin
flavour should be proportional with the each flavour’s share of total transaction
volume.

A multicurrency nomin system clearly has the advantage of providing the benefits
of stablecoins to many markets, and thus of deepening the fee-generating volume
for havvens. But that these nomin flavours are interrelated by the common pool
of capital provides extra utility in the form of relatively cheap foreign exchange
in nomins, using havven issuance to settle between them. The introduction of
new nomin flavours will become straightforward, requiring only the creation of
a new oracle for the intended asset, which does not have to be a currency.

Once this version of the system is operational, additional extensions to its capa-
bilities are anticipated for future work.

A.3 Continuing Development

The Havven protocol is not tied to any particular distributed ledger, only re-
quiring general smart contract capabilities and a modicum of speed. However,
its ultimate success is tied to the solution of a number of fundamental problems
in the blockchain space, and to the quality of its own mechanisms. To this end,
research and development efforts will continue in a number of relevant areas,
which may include:

+ Fast decentralised oracles.

- Alternative (scalable) blockchains and cross-chain functionality.

- Improved fee structures, including dynamic fees and hedging charges.
+ Refined stabilisation mechanisms.

- System parameter optimisation.
+ Stablecoin econometrics and modelling.

In addition to these fundamental questions, the Havven foundation will continue
to pursue integrations with projects which would benefit from a stable unit
of account. This encompasses any platform needing a settlement token which
integrates with decentralised systems. All such efforts aim to increase nomin
transaction volume, increasing the resources available for havven holders to
stabilise the token.

B_ Modelling

We take the view that falsification is vital in validating a proposed cryptoeco-
nomic system. The more resilient a given system is to hypothetical attacks, the
more trust can be put in its viability.

Ultimately this must done empirically, but it is also important to model Havven
extensively before launch. Therefore in our quantitative analysis we have sought
above all to identify its failure modes, and also to characterise its stability under
a range of conditions.

In our quantitative analysis, we have taken three distinct approaches in modelling
the system:

Analytical

By expressing our system in the language of game theory and microeco-
nomics, we seek to gain insight into Havven’s incentive structure and the
resulting price equilibria. Examining the problem from this direction leads
us to concise and mathematically robust conclusions.

Simulationist

We implement a broad range of strategies as AI agents, and examine
how the market responds under different initial conditions, with different
constituent populations, and in response to external shocks. This approach
allows us to examine situations which are analytically intractable.

Empirical

The earlier releases of the Havven system are invaluable in testing our
assumptions about later ones. Observation of real market behaviour al-
lows us to better understand how it responds in different situations, and
therefore how to choose appropriate values for system variables.

Some of the results of our analytical investigations can be found here, while a
simulation may be found here, and its code here.

26
B.1 Agent-Based Modelling

It has been observed that analytic methods are often difficult to apply in the
complex and dynamic setting of a market. One suggested solution to this prob-
lem is agent-based modelling. Under this paradigm, we proceed by first defining
rational agent behaviour and then simulating the interplay of those strategies
over time. We seek to develop a more effective method of characterising market
behaviour and equilibrium prices than pure analytic reasoning.

Such simulations also provide an immediate means of measuring quantities of
interest. Simply by observing the model, we can discover how varying input
parameters affect system outputs in an experimental fashion. One important
corollary is that this is a way of extracting reasonable settings for system pa-
rameters (such as fee levels) that might be difficult to reason about a priori.
These systems, reactive as they are, also provide a method for testing proposed
remedies for any identified failure modes, and are a platform to simulate the
conclusions of any antecedent game-theoretic reasoning.

B.2. Expected Market Players

Here we outline some of the players anticipated in the market. These represent
only some of the agents that our modelling and simulations are predicated upon.

Havven Holders

A havven holder provides the collateral and liquidity for the system. It
is assumed that havven holders primarily seek fee revenues, and escrow
most of their havvens, adjusting their issuance to track Havven’s moving
fee incentives. While these incentives make sense if havvens are relatively
stable in the long term, Havven will also provide incentives for correcting
the nomin price in in the short term. Returns for these actors are primarily
realised in fees, seignorage, and the appreciation of havvens resulting from
their constrained supply.

Nomin Users

These are the market participants who will make up the base demand for
any stablecoin, chasing its superior utility as a medium of exchange or as
as means of hedging against other forms of value. The users of nomins may
include merchants, consumers, service providers, cryptocurrency market
actors such as exchanges.

The transaction volume these users provide is necessary for fees to ex-
ist. They may be disincentivised from using the system in low liquidity
situations or with excessive volatility in the price of nomins.

27
Speculators

Speculators may tend to magnify price corrections, and are a significant
vector by which to introduce exogenous shocks to the system. In our
modelling we induce volatility by simulating modes of interest such as
large capital flows in response to breaking news and the like.

Speculators also produce an important stabilisation force. When the mar-
ket believes that the price is being stabilised, upward price shifts induce
sell pressure, and downward price shifts induce buy pressure. This strategy
is profitable on the assumption that the price will return to the equilibrium
point. This neutral stabilisation force is a self-sustaining negative feedback
loop which operates independently of other incentives; preliminary simu-
lations and observations of other systems have verified the efficacy of this
corrective pressure.

Arbitrageurs and Market Makers

The arbitrage force allows us to assume that the havven/nomin, havven/fiat,
nomin/fiat prices are properly in alignment or will soon become aligned.
Market-making activities allow us in our modelling to neglect the bid/ask
spread, and situations where there is insufficient liquidity for players to
transact.

Executive Summary

Origins of Ambrosus

/know that / am mortal and the creature of a day. but when / search out the

The Ambrosus network is a blockchain-based ecosystem for supply
chains, ensuring the origin, quality, compliance and proper handling of
items tracked by the network. Ambrosus’ primary focus is on improving
supply chains for life-essential products, specifically food and medicine,
although the protocol can be applied to almost any complex supply chain.

By using distributed ledgers, data processing and sensor systems, the Am-
brosus platform can integrate across supply chain flows and enable trans-
parency at every point within them. These new capabilities allow buyers
and other participants in the supply chain to ensure that the standards of
their Quality Assurance programs are being met. Ambrosus also enables
the transmission of additional information between supply chain counter-
parties, as well as the creation of new applications and markets that utilize
the platform's real-time data.

Ambrosus uses a novel incentive mechanism called the Amber token to
provide these functions in a decentralized manner. The Amber token is
used to keep information on the Ambrosus network up to date as prod-
ucts move across the supply chain without requiring a centralized actor
© maintain resources. This token enables a transparent ecosystem with
rustworthy data that can be freely accessed by interested parties.

This White Paper provides an overview of the Ambrosus platform, its arch
ecture, and case studies. We have also created other guides that may be
of interest to those learning about the Ambrosus network. These guides
are available in English, Chinese (Mandarin), Russian, Arabic, Korean and
Japanese and are available online at: https://ambrosus.com/#tech-docs.

Many have — rightly — sounded the alarm, and are searching for
new solutions.

1.1. A Data-Centric Solution

At its core, the solution to improving global supply chains
revolves around handling data. Until now, it has been difficult to
gather accurate data about the state and integrity of materials
and products along the whole supply chain. Even where data is
available, it is challenging to collect it, aggregate it, disseminate it
and, above all, ensure its accuracy and integrity.

New technological developments are poised to change this.

These developments, which in particular include advances in
sensor technology and the Internet of Things coupled with
the capabilities of blockchain technology, smart contracts and
decentralized applications (dApps), allow us to boldly rethink
how global supply chains and markets might operate.

We envision a system of interconnected quality assurance
sensors that can reliably record the entire history of a product".
A blockchain can then protect the integrity and verifiability of
this sensor data. Finally, smart contracts can provide automated
governance of supply chains and manage commercial
relationships between actors along them?®..

1.2. The Ambrosus Project

Ambrosus is an ambitious project dedicated to making the vision
we have described a reality. The project is made up of some of
the world’s leading experts and pioneers in the areas of sensor
technology, data encryption, supply chains, blockchain, smart
contracts and dApps, among others (see Team below).

Our team’s mission is to create useful solutions for supply
chains that enhance their quality, integrity and transparency,
thus improving the quality and integrity of the products we all
consume.

We believe this vision can be best achieved through self-
governed, quality-focused networks to track products across
relevant supply chains. These would be true ecosystems based
onan open platform enabled by blockchain technology, with no
centralized owner. The Ambrosus protocol is being developed to
expressly allow the creation of such ecosystems.

1.3. Ambrosus Technology

Ambrosus is an end-to-end integrated solution that includes
hardware, software, a protocol layer and developer tools.

The Ambrosus protocol and the software layer on top of it are
built on the Ethereum blockchain as well as other distributed
technologies that allow information from lol devices to be
recorded onto a decentralized network. We are also building a
developer toolkit to facilitate the creation of apps on top of the
network. This includes an open API tailored to the needs of food
and pharmaceutical supply chain participants, one that is flexible
enough to use with any type of commodity or consumer good.
A JavaScript interface to Ambrosus sits on top of the blockchain
layer, permitting users to develop to our platform without any
blockchain programming Knowledge.

Ambrosus
To demonstrate how this can work, we have built a functioning
prototype of an ecosystem that showcases the protocol’s ability to
collect information from lol devices and record it on immutable
decentralized databases. At the time of writing, we have released
demo applications built on top of the current implementation of
the protocol. These are publicly available online.

At the same time, the Ambrosus team is developing hardware
sensors that feature plug-and-play compatibility with our
blockchain network. The hardware products we have built to
date include a range of non-invasive and rapid analytical devices
for on-site measurement of biological samples. We are in the
process of assembling lol sensors around containers and printers
to transform passive supply chain components into smart and
intelligent systems.

Our development pipeline includes personalized tag methods as
well as food grade tracers and biosensors to transform passive
packaging solutions into smart conveying systems. These
products connect to our blockchain through different gateways
customized for different use cases.

Future iterations of our system will include ready-made and
reusable connectors to rapidly share supply chain information
with existing information services such as SAP or Oracle and
which leverage GS1 standards such as EPCIS (Electronic Product
Code Information Services)!”

1.4. The Amber Token

The heart of the Ambrosus network is the Amber token, an
ERC-20 compliant token that underpins all transactions on the
Ambrosus network.

Amber is the world's first data-bonded token. It is used to bind
continuously updated and verified logistical, environmental
and biological data from the supply chain to its correspondin
product as it travels between counterparties. It is also used t
carry out transfers of value within the ecosystem. As such, th
token performs both the utility and transfer of value functions
within the ecosystem of applications built on top of Ambrosus
protocol.

1.5. White Paper

In our view, Ambrosus Is the most advanced project to date to
tackle the complex and often life-essential challenges posed by
today’s global supply chains.

In the following chapters, we examine the Ambrosus protocol
and the technologies being developed around the project. It is our
hope that, with Ambrosus, we are creating tools that will enable
all those involved in supply chains to meet industry challenges
and create a new generation of trusted supply chains to meet the
world’s life-essential needs.

2.1. Overview

In the following chap

ter, we describe key components of the

Ambrosus protocol as well as important details relating to its
structure and implementation.

2.1.1. Protocol Components

The Ambrosus protocol is constructed from three main

components:

e Measurements Repository: Built around the Measurements
Smart Contract, this component manages a_ distribute

dataset for product-
of a programmable

system (IPFS). This smart contract is used to store readings
of specified attributes collected for a given batch at specified

changes or deletion.

° Capacity: The system is capable of storing large quantities
of small data packages.

° Requirements Smart Contract: This enshrines the quality
requirements to be compared with the content of

Smart Contract. Some of the ways well-

defined requirements can be used and reused include:

° Monitoring: Users can verify that the quality of a particular
batch of products fulfills pre-defined requirements.

° Agreements: Multiple parties can automatically execute

terms of agree

ments by comparing the content of the

Measurements Smart Contract against the definition in the
Requirements Smart Contract. This includes automatic

payments settl

ment on the blockchain.

Ambrosus

11
e Amber token: The data-bonded token architecture intrinsically
ties data to AMB transactions on the blockchain, connecting
chains together as products move through the supply chain.

Together, these components form the foundation of the
Ambrosus protocol.

2.1.2. System Architecture

The Ambrosus protocol is built to support high data loads
from hardware devices and network participants with
substantially higher capacity than standard Ethereum software
implementations. The platform's architecture is designed to
be reusable in different industries, even those outside of the
Ambrosus core team’s focus. We discuss our system architecture
in detail at the end of this chapter.

2.2. Measurements Repository

The Measurements Repository component of the Ambrosus
protocol manages a distributed database for product-specific
measurements. It is used to store readings of specified attributes
collected for a given item at specified points along a supply
chain. Key properties of the Measurement Repository include
authentication, capacity, transparency and immutability. We will
discuss firsttwo in the following sections. The lattertwo properties
will be a natural consequence of overall design.

2.2.1. Authentication

The Ambrosus network authenticates devices using public-
private key cryptography. Each device on the network signs data
transmissions with its unique private key in order to prove its
identity as an authorised device. Signatures from devices can be
verified against a list of authorised devices, which is a mapping of
public keys to devices that is publicly available in a smart contract.

The Measurements Smart Contract includes a defined list of
authorized measurement devices. Ambrosus-certified devices

To achieve this network capacity, Ambrosus has created a custom
blockchain that integrates with the Ethereum blockchain and a
distributed storage system.

In our early design of Ambrosus, we found that relying exclusive
on the Ethereum blockchain for data storage was prohibitive
limited in its capacity to handle Ambrosus’ full data needs. Th
dual architecture that Ambrosus has created provides a scalab
solution to the network's data capacity while maintainin
decentralization, immutability and transparency.

aonarax«<

ew measurement data is stored as leaves in a Merkle tree. The
easurements tree nodes are then mapped to IPFS nodes. A
erkle tree is a structure that allows any party to quickly verify
he validity of data in a branch or leaf using the root hash of
he tree. In the Ambrosus network, this allows any network
participant to quickly verify that a particular measurement is
part of the given asurements Repository. The root of the
erkle Tree is permanently stored in the Ambrosus network's
easurements Smart Contract. Every new measurement added
o the Measurements Smart Contract creates a new version of
he Merkle Tree with a new root, which can then be stored in the
easurements Smart Contract.

To retain a scalable system structure, Ambrosus chooses not to
save a new root of the tree every time the tree changes (i.e., when
anew measurement comes in). This would mean writing to the
blockchain whenever new data arrives. Instead, the root of the
tree is updated in the smart contract periodically (e.g., once every
100 readings).

Storing the Merkle tree root on the blockchain ensures the data
cannot be modified once it is written into a contract. Ambrosus
also maintains the entire history of all Merkle roots to ensure
that no data has vanished or been altered between Merkle tree
updates.

2.3 Requirements Smart Contract

The second component of the Ambrosus protocol is the
Requirements Smart Contract. This portion of the protocolis used
to define quality standards that can be directly compared to items
in the Measurements Smart Contract. It is important that users
create a set of well-defined, designed and tested Requirements
contracts which are publically available on the blockchain. The
requirements defined by users will be critical to applications
monitoring items in the ecosystem.

In its simplest expression, the Requirements Smart Contract
determines whether a product continuously meets standards
defined by an interested participant in the Ambrosus network. For
instance, a party may define distribution requirements to ensure
food or pharmaceutical products remain safe for consumption.
However, the concept of consumption is relative and depends
on the product's purpose. For instance, a product might need to
meet different requirements for:

« Consumption by humans

« Consumption by babies

¢ Consumption by animals

« Consumption by people with allergies

¢« Consumption by patients with certain conditions

¢ Instant consumption or future consumption

e Further processing (of different types).

For food products, Ambrosus can go further and define the
various levels of quality for a particular product (e.g., low/mid/
high/premium quality).

From atechnical perspective, Requirements are lists of statements
based on the readings from sensing devices. We can define a

list Of measurement ranges that are acceptable to an example

< Amb

rQSUS
company in the food industry. The following is an illustrative list
of Requirements for a batch of milk, defining a set of the following
ranges:

e Temperature [4°C to 7°C],
e Fat [3.18% to 3.22%],
e Lactose [2% to 4%].

Similarly, monitoring systems in the pharmaceutical industry may
define the following Requirements for frozen vaccine storage:

e Temperature [-25°C to -10°C],
« Humidity [2 to 3%],
¢ No direct sunlight or fluorescent light.

Requirements may be described using different quantifiable
variables: range, binary (true/false) statements with information
supplied by specific devices, orinputfromahuman inspector (with
the appropriate device and his own private key and reputation).
Complex statements are also permitted (e.g., the temperature
must be in the range [0°C to 10°C] for no longer than 10 minutes
and [4°C to 7°C] thereafter). An alternative complex statement
may define measurement timing (e.g., at least one temperature
measurement must be taken every 10 minutes). These complex
statements may also be coupled with instant financial rewards or
penalties for assuring or failing to assure high quality, respectively.

We expect more advanced Requirements to use Statistical
analysis and machine learning to detect irregularities and support
automated decision-making and real-time auditing. Those
algorithms can be coded as Ethereum contracts or performed
off-chain and verified on Ethereum.

As Requirements are sets of smart contracts working together
and delivering from each other, in terms of object-oriented
programming, Requirements can be viewed as a composite
design pattern.

The diagram below provides a detailed overview of how
Requirements are structured.

2.4. Amber Token

upporting the Ambrosus network is an ERC-20 compliant to-
ken called Amber. Amber is the first data-bonded token. As items
move through the supply chain and are transformed in the man-
ufacturing process, the Amber balance assigned to a particular
batch can be splitand merged into multiple other Measurements
Smart Contracts, which together create a graph representing the

istory of a given item. Amber tokens are sent to the network

Contract untila batch has completed its movement through the
supply chain.

Amber tokens remain bonded to a product until a defined expi-
ration date or until the “termination event”, which can be defined
by a purchase, delivery or any other event on the supply chain.

End consumers can claim tokens at the end of the cycle. In this
way, tokens can be recycled and return to the ecosystem. The
value gained by recycling tokens incentivizes consumers to pur-
chase Ambrosus-tracked products. This cycle also benefits pro-
ducers, who receive free promotion.

2.5. Optimizing Network Costs

To bolster adoption of Ambrosus, it is important to optimize the
costs of using the network. Each individual supply chain uses
unique transactions and contract deployments on the Ethereum
network to handle data as items move through the chain. Run-
ning transactions on the Ethereum blockchain has become fairly
expensive, and our custom blockchain implementation solves
this issue.

Instead of the main Ethereum network, the main transactiona
network used by Ambrosus Is the Ambrosus blockchain, a private
version of the Ethereum blockchain. Note that the term “private”
iS potentially misleading here, as the network is public and can
be accessed by anyone. The term is only used in this context to
distinguish the Ambrosus blockchain from the Ethereum main
network. All smart contracts related to the Ambrosus protoco
will run on the Ambrosus blockchain, which will be periodically
copied to the Ethereum main network for further validation.

While the Amber token crowdsale will initially take place on the
Ethereum blockchain, Amber tokens will be transferred to the
Ambrosus network once the construction of the Ambrosus
blockchain is complete.

2.6. Architecture

2.6.1. Layered architecture

At the lowest level, Ambrosus is a set of core Ethereum smart
contracts (including but not limited to the Measurements and
Requirements Smart Contracts introduced in the previous sec-
tions). These serve as core business logic of Ambrosus and sup-
port data storage.

Ambrosus
A JavaScript library sits above our contract layer. The JavaScript layer ex-
poses the Ambrosus protocol interface to application developers. It ab-
stracts the details related to particular implementation choices (e.g., we
currently use Ethereum as a blockchain and IPFS as a distributed storage).

This layer is also used to run software that does not need to be distributed
and/or is expensive to implement as a smart contract, such as offline mea-
surement verification. On-chain and off-chain operations are combined

here into a single consistent interface.

The top layer of Ambrosus consists of a React Component library. It pro-
vides Ul components for building applications on top of Ambrosus net-
work. This layer can be accessed by any web browser and connects to the

JavaScript layer.

2.6.2. Data Architecture

Ambrosus uses an additional three-layer architecture for storing data:

1. The first layer is a library used to store large quantities of small data with

blockchain and distributed file sys
of individual data in a transparen

ems. This layer can store collections
, persistent and immutable manner.

Core concepts here are signed data and Merkle trees.

2. The second layer is dedicated to
such as Measurements and Requl

supply chains. It employs concepts
ements Smart Contracts.

3. The top layer is Ambrosus.js, a protocol dedicated to food and phar-
maceutical supply chains, with specific types of measurements and re-

quirements related to those indus

ries.

An overall technical overview of Ambrosus’ architecture protocol along
with the key dependencies is given below. We also provide a sample ap-
plication to demonstrate how it interacts with Ambrosus.

Depending on the needs of a particular project, developers can
use some or all of the features of our JavaScript and React li-
braries and/or the Measurements and Requirements Smart Con-
tracts.

 Ambrosus
oly Chain

The previous section focused on the software components of
Ambrosus. This section describes how data originates on devices
and its journey to Ambrosus’ software.

3.1. Tag, Tracer and Sensor Systems

A key attribute of the Ambrosus network is its comprehensive
support for lol hardware and sensors, which provides the ability
to tag and monitor physical objects and transmit data associated
with them. This compatibility allows goods to be tracked
throughout the supply chain and assures full integrity of readings.
The Ambrosus network primarily collects data from tags, tracers
and sensors.

A tag Is an element set on the product itself, generally on top
of the packaging, that provides information about the product
and its identity. 1D/2D barcodes and passive electronic RFID
stickers are examples of common tagging systems. A tracer
is a natural compositional feature of a product or an added
component inserted into a product, while a sensor is a device
that detects and responds to some type of input from the
physical environment. Sensors characterize the product and/
or its environmental physico-chemical properties. A tracer
will remain stable throughout its entire supply chain journey,
whereas the correct sensor solution would need to be designed
for each counterparty on the supply chain and will likely require
more upfront investment and knowledge of product properties.
Tracers are the ideal solution to track and trace products. When
implemented in a supply chain, sensor solutions assess quality,
safety and logistical conditions.

Ambrosus
3.2. Detection Systems

Specific detection systems are selected and deployed by
Ambrosus at various stages in the supply chain to offer the most

effective and cost-efficien
stage. A product's physio-

3.3. Data Transmission

When information is transmitted from a device to the Ambrosus
network, the data is bonded to an Amber token and sent to
the network. Common information that may be sent in a data

transmission includes:

Tag |IDs, location and time, tracer, sensors and gateway |Ds;
Digitized certificates and transaction IDs;

Product quality and safety attributes;

. Transportation, handling and storage conditions as measured

5. Producer operability, capability and workability;
6. Integrity of detection systems;

25
An Amber token follows a product or batch along the supply
chain, acting as a digital certificate that ensures the transparent
transfer of information. All prior information can be retrieved at
any supply chain stage.

Ambrosus is already actively working with industry partners
to study various potential uses of the protocol. The list below
contains market-fit studies we are currently running. Detailed

2. Food Industry: Compliance and Auditing

The food industry is dogged by regular scandals, the lates
being the egg scandal in Europe, where consumers suffered
from fraudulent practices involving fresh eggs contaminated by
pesticides'®!. Mishandling and fraudulent processes are almos
always eventually discovered, but by the time they are brought to
public attention, the damage is done. Consumers have already
bought, and likely consumed, the product, leading to potentia
health issues, loss of confidence, recalls, and other penalties.
These problems stem from a lack of auditing. Companies are
audited far too rarely, and the auditing process itself is time
consuming and inefficient.

consumers’ trust in the system.

3. Healthcare Industry: Data Information
Management

The healthcare industry has been trying for a while now to
encourage patients to take a more active role in managing
heir own care by self-administering medicines?! which are
usually taken at hospitals or bought in a pharmacy. Delivering
personalized prescriptions to patients’ homes would free up
much-needed capacity elsewhere in the system and is thus an
important challenge for the pharmaceutical industry.

But migrating from a system in which care is provided in a
relatively small number of hospitals, clinics and surgeries to
one in which care is provided through a widespread network
of nurses and community carers has enormous ramifications.
Pharma companies will need to distribute products to many
more locations, including patients’ homes. It will have to be
able to deliver new therapies requiring rapid and constraining
shipping solutions, especially to emerging markets, with better
risk management and in compliance with more stringent quality
requirements. The pharmaceutical industry will therefore have
to harness the most efficient ‘final mile’ distribution networks in
order to deliver medicines as economically as possible.

The immediate challenge is for healthcare to change its
business model to a consumer-centric one, with a demand-
driven supply chain. The key to preventing such a supply chain
from becoming too fragmented and complex is seamless
bidirectional management of information between patients and
pharmaceutical companies. Information about patients and the
medicines they need will thus be as important as the products
themselves.

Ambrosus
Ambrosus is designed for long and complex supply chains. Forthe
healthcare industry, the Ambrosus protocol can connect digital
smart tracers to medical products, with Amber tokens servin
to connect the medical product and th
data about it. As a product moves through the supply chain an
passes along different stages and sensors, Amber tokens follow |
persistently. This creates the highest assurance of traceability an
compliance for allingredients and components of drugs, while a
the same time monitoring proper handling conditions for them.

necessary, the solution can even be tailored to the personal need
of individual patients. Any parameters can be encoded throug

the smart contracts which power the Ambrosus protocol.

The Ambrosus protocol acts as the backbone for the informatio
platforms needed by logistics systems to record and exchang

data securely and economically with suppliers around the world,

to recall and analyse data very rapidly and to respond to sudde
changes in supply and demand. The protocol is complemented
by Ambrosus tracers and sensor systems that assure advanced
ities, which enable logistics systems to monitor
he factory gate to the patient's door efficiently
minating any scope for human error.

l!. Current State and Future Work

At the time of writing, we have implemented a prototype of a
protocol along with example apps which use the protocol.

1. Prototype

The screenshot below is from an application using the protocol.
Theapp provides a distributed marketplace for food, where parties
can agree on the quality of food delivered. Quality is measured
and stored on distributed storage. An escrow allows agreement
to be automatically settled based on sensor readings, allowing
the creation of quality-conditional contracts.

A demo is available at: ambrosus-demo.com.

Why Crypto

A challenging question for the majority of the
cryptocurrency community and, at the same
time,a mission that initially seemed impossible
to us arose from the presence of our project in
the field of crypto cryptocurrency.

Unlike all unsuccessful versions of the
cryptocurrency market, our project will offer a
new form of combining cryptocurrency
opportunities and achieving a lofty goal in the
vast animal community around the world since
we argue that the cryptocurrency community is
the great power of powerless creatures.

We know that you want to play a role in changing
and ensuring the well-being of animals, but you
may not have found a suitable platform for this to
date. Our platform has created a golden
opportunity for animal advocates around the
world through which each user sponsors
campaigns in addition to increasing his/her
capital through us.

Why MALITOKEN

Theoretical and legal issues of animals and
related challenges have been largely neglected
although human rights and their theoretical and
procedural foundations are very popular. Animal

rights may challenge some aspects of human
rights because the equality of human rights and
animal rights, as well as the difference between
the two, is established only in the sense of
suffering and the presumption of emotion and the
power of expression in animals.

Belgian Malinois, the guardian of peace, which
was born in 1981 to the medical school by the
Hobart brothers, completed all of its assigned
missions successfully. This time, the hero
Malinois, in a huge challenge in the crypto space,
seeks to realize the contribution of its fellow
breeds and, if possible, the large animal
community by connecting the separate links of
the global animal protection chain, which is the
same animal rights campaigns. It makes it
possible for every one of you the real animal
advocates by offering its platform tokens on the
popular blockchain, Binance Smart Chain.

Our concern

Animals are members of the moral community.
Animal welfare means their right to enjoy
well-being in life and to increase their well-being
with the protection of the law and legislation
with an animal protection approach.

Animal welfare advocates have concerns such as
killing them for food or recreation, using them for
scientific research, using them in zoos and
circuses, food and health poverty, and lack of
shelter. These are just some of the threats to
animal life. So, groups around the world have
begun spontaneous and popular activities in the
form of campaigns to combat such anti-animal
behavior, as well as to provide food and shelter
for animals.

Unfortunately, these activities have not been
enough and effective due to the large population
of animals and the high volume of their
challenges. Our project has new and practical
ideas in the world of cryptocurrency due to its
attractive levers and potential. Our alternate goal
is to unite all animal-friendly groups and
campaigns around the world with your
participation. These separate circles will become
a chain of attention and well-being of the animal
community with your participation.

Interestingly, even in the field of cryptocurrency,
we see the use of the names and shapes of native
dogs and cats in each location by a large number
of different projects to sell their tokens, projects
sometimes briefly mention the extinction of
certain breeds and the vital threats to them in
their goals and even have provided facilities for the
participation of cryptocurrency users, such as

SHIBA INU, in parts of their platform. Accordingly,
there is a lot of appreciation and thanks to the
leaders and managers of these projects.

We want to stress the importance of saving and
ensuring the well-being of these earthly angels
requires more attention and more practical action.

This is where Malinois, the hero, uses its ability
and intelligence to solve problems with the
powerful leverage of Malitoken. It needs strong
executive arms to strengthen animal protection
campaigns.

ROAD MAP

The biggest question for our team is whether
people like Elon Musk lead a technocratic
revolution with dogs. Dogecoin is now more
valuable than Twitter with the help of Musk.
Shiba Inu commands an army of supporters of a
beautiful breed. What magical power lies in the
nature of these purest creatures of God,

causing them to be are a source of goodness

even in the businesses of their owners? Isn't it
time for these faithful creatures to own the
business of their names and spend all the
proceeds to improve the welfare of their fellow
breeds? There will be a great revolution in the
animal community if human beings who love
animals intelligently monitor these matters. Our
project team no longer sees these tokens as
mere means of making money but to advancing
a pioneering technology.

V1-10/12/21-MALI BOOK WWW.MALITOKEN.COM

TAlthough blockchain is a special technology,
this project will not be just a technological
revolution, but a huge transformation in the Big
Bang dimension in the field of culture of dealing
with animals. These sacred tokens are a joint
investment opportunity between humans and
animals. We promise you that you will see
exponential profits in your wallets while
strengthening weak and needy animal
protection campaigns by investing in
Malitokens. This is because our philanthropic
project has been sponsored by many great
figures in various fields of sports, art, cinema,
and politics. Thus, we will have big and
impressive names in our holder box.

This is just the beginning. We plan to quickly
transfer our platform to our dedicated
blockchain so that malitoken sponsors and
investors can experience a safe and
inexpensive platform to transfer their money
with us. Our goals are big, and the tools we
have now are few. We claim cultural innovation
in the world of technology provided that we feel
the warm presence of each of you alongside the
Malitoken project.

Conclusion

The Malitoken community, which started with
the seed of a spiritual idea, enters the world of
cryptocurrencies with a minimal budget and a
simple leadership of animal protection
campaigns in the world where financial
problems have become a major obstacle to their
animal-friendly activities. By introducing its
financial platform, the community has provided
the opportunity for individual lovers of street
dogs and cats to play an important role in
providing shelter for these terrestrial angels as
their capital grows.

Our team has volunteered for a great, amazing
job and sees a shining light at the end of the
tunnel. We are determined to make our dreams
come true and believe that the path in which
BTC is flagging the world's counter-movement
system can be used as a pretext to save
animals because all of our members have a
common goal and start a new era of animal
rights advocacy. In our opinion, it is time for
supporters of stray dogs and cats to put their
vision into practice globally in cryptocurrency.

Malitoken will be an important point of contact
between the nascent decentralized world and
the animal-friendly global community, enabling
us to make our view to the widespread
acceptance of cryptocurrency Defi. We
acknowledge that none of this would have been
possible without your participation.

We rise, we change.

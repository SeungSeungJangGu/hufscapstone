CONNECTED CAR/AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE SECURITY AND
INFORMATION PLATFORM WITH BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY

CUBE is anetwork security company based on Blockchain

At present, the automobile market of 1.7 trillion USD, has reached an important
turning point. The rapid expansion of car connectivity has brought attention to
the significance of network security. Newly manufactured cars from 2020 will
be produced with a built-in CDMA. Connected cars are expected to be under
constant cyber-attacks, similar to the malicious attacks towards network
connected PCs. CUBE is preparing to embrace a pivotal role in the rapidly

changing vehicle market.

Endpoint

Blockchain
CUBE Multi-layer Protection

Connected cars and autonomous vehicles require a myriad of communication
hubs: vehicle to vehicle (V2V), vehicle to network(V2N), vehicle to
Infrastructure(V2I), vehicle to device(V2D) and et cetera. The increased
connectivity increases the user convenience, yet also increases the attack
surface for possible malicious malware attacks. Thus, network security is pivotal
in stabilizing the connectivity in vehicles. CUBE utilizes Blockchain, Deep
Learning (in-depth learning) based Al-intelligence, Quantum hash encryption,
Endpoint protection and Cloud-based Intelligence to ensure secure automotive

network.

|. BLOCKCHAIN SECURITY

The conventional blockchain technology grants security whilst maintaining
simplicity, but has its limitation on transmitting large files. CUBE Blockchain
security resolves the drawbacks of conventional blockchain, through utilizing
peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol and asymmetric encryption. CUBE
Blockchain technology will provide next generation security for the automobile
industry, taking advantage of the impossibleto-hack nature of blockchain, whilst

providing rapid data transfer.

2. CUBEBOX ENDPOINT SECURITY TECHNOLOGY

Connected cars engage in multilateral communication from various external
sources: vehicle to network(V2N), vehicle to vehicle(V2V), vehicle to
Infrastructure(V2I), and vehicle to device(V2D). CUBE Endpoint Security
Technology generates endpoints at all external connection points for
protection. CUBE’s unique technology uses hash to scan and distinguish over
300 million ‘known’ attacks with only 1OMBs of disk space. In fact, even with our
light-weight software, it holds the fastest endpoint processing speed amongst

the existing endpoint security product.

3. CLOUD CHECK BOX TECHNOLOGY
CUBE Cloud Technology can distinguish ‘unknown’ attacks through

transmitting suspicious files to the cloud malware database, the Check Box. Our
Cloud Check box is partnered with more than 50,000 corporations, that uploads
and shares newly encountered malware on a transnational database. ‘Unknown’
attacks that are left unidentified are sent to Sandbox, where files run in a virtual
vehicle environment. Based on the verdict from the Sandbox analysis, the

results are uploaded to the database and will be shared across other vehicles.

TECHNOLOGY APPLICATION
AUTOMOTIVE MARKET TREND

CUBE incorporates blockchain, endpoint and Cloud-based CheckBox to

implement following business models.

@1. DATA BUSINESS

According to the Mckinsey Report, the value of data collected from the car
exceeds that of the car itself. CUBEBOX enables anyone to become data
producer through simply plugging our device in a car. CUBE will establish an
ecosystem of automobile data sales and aim to become the world’s largest Big

Data company.

DATA CONSUMERS

THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF PARTS.
DATA PROVIDERS AND DATA CONSUMERS

Data Providers

The CUBE token links driving-related information from the car to data
consumers who need this information. Drivers generate this information
as they drive and receive CUBE tokens in return. CUBE then links it into a
blockchain. Data providers can use this to tap into services such as

“Over the Air’(OTA) autonomous car security, and mileage insurance

services from data consumers.

Data Consumers

Data consumers who need this information will provide their services in
exchange of CUBE tokens. Automobile generated information, is sent,
utilized, and received by all nodes. Data consumers can also provide OTA
services and autonomous car driving support information to data providers.
This circulation is a key principle of the CUBE token. CUBE’s tech can be
applied to different blockchains and improve data security and sharing

in various real world situations.

patches.

3. AUTOMOTIVE SECURITY BUSINESS

According to ‘Cybersecurity Ventures’, the cybersecurity market grew from 3.5
billion USD in 2004 to 120 billion dollars in 2017, more than 35-fold within a
short time span. The switch to connected cars will result in burgeoning of the
demand for network security. CUBE will provide robust security, that is vehicle-

optimized and based on blockchain, endpoint and cloud checkbox technology

INTER-COMMUNICATION NETWORK SECURITY
An autonomous vehicle must acquire as much information as possible about its
surroundings to operate the vehicle alone. Such information may be path
information for navigation, traffic information, or data for updating an old
firmware of an autonomous vehicle. Receiving such a variety of data can be very
helpful in operating autonomous vehicles, but at the same time increases the

risk of malicious intrusions.

V2N, which means Vehicle to Vehicle communication, is an important function
to make an autonomous car safer. In a connected car, the vehicle receives

various vehicle data points from other nearby vehicles.

V2V helps to operate autonomous vehicles in various aspects. There are two
types of V2V information, short range and long range. Representative
information of the short range can be the distance between the vehicles and the
behavior data of the driver. Long range information includes road conditions,

accident information on the road, and traffic information.

CUBE Intelligence | Page 8
cube
IOT SECURITY

Many lol devices are used to operate autonomous vehicles. The most
representative is the “Guide Assist loT,’ which will be applied to smart roads. This
loT informs the autonomous car of its current position, receives speed and
driving information from the autonomous vehicle, and sends this information to

the clients who need it.

While a variety of technologies are available to ensure safety when an
autonomous vehicle is operated, the technology within the vehicle alone is not
enough. The most obvious method is to install the loT on the road where the
autonomous vehicle is running. The autonomous vehicle is constantly in
communication with the lol on the smart road. In this case, it is necessary to

certify that the loT of the smart road is the authorized loT.

The biggest problem here is the speed of authentication. An loT should be
manufactured at low cost because it must be distributed in large quantities.
Therefore, we cannot expect a high level of processing power. In particular, it is

impossible for a car running in the public chain of this type to operate loT.

Therefore, a method of authenticating a chain closer to real-time than real-time
authentication is needed. CUBE sees this loT’s real-time authentication method

as one of the important future development factors.

INTRA-COMMUNICATION NETWORK SECURITY

Automakers need to communicate with autonomous cars continually. Most
important is navigation routing information, which includes traffic information.
For completely autonomous self-driving cars, the car should receive the routing
information from the automaker’s traffic management centre. Even though the
car has the navigation map data, it should receive the best route information,
which comes with live traffic information. The potential danger is a malicious

attacker with fake traffic information, such as fake traffic or a fake road block.

CUBE Intelligence | Page 9

cube

An autonomous car has a much more complicated Electronic Control Unit,
which includes Break Control Unit (BCU), Transmission Control Unit (TCU),
Wheel Control Unit (WCU), and many other units to control self-driving
functions. An ECU being penetrated by a malicious attacker could be seriously
dangerous. A great problem arises in terms of security because of the network
between automakers and the gateway of autonomous cars. An automotive
company should check each autonomous car's loT devices to make sure that
every autonomous car's ECU works without problem. At the same time, an
automotive company should upgrade their automotive car's firmware remotely
through the network. These checks and upgrades must be done regularly as all
of these network connections will make the automotive cars vulnerable to

malicious attacks.

1. BLOCKCHAIN LAYER

The key to blockchain is that the technology ensures trust. CUBE uses
blockchain technology to ensure the security of autonomous mobile networks.
But there are various difficulties in applying traditional blockchain to
autonomous vehicle safety. The problem of blockchain is the slow speed and the

low scalability.

At the heart of blockchain is securing trust with technology. So far, no
technology has been able to prevent hacking 100% in the network. But the
blockchain has shown a remarkable ability to prevent hacking completely

without any failure in the past decade.

By solving the slow speed problem and the scalability issues that the blockchain

has, we will be able to provide the highest level of autonomous car security

CUBE Intelligence | Page 10

1.1 THE PROBLEM OF CONVENTIONAL SECURITY
AND NEED FOR BLOCKCHAIN

There are three major problems in traditional automotive technology.

The amount of data that the car must process is tens of times larger than the

data amount of other virtual currencies.

CENTRALIZATION ISSUE

The amount of data received from the outside while driving is estimated to be
more than 4Terabite per day. Such a large amount of data causes a serious
problem. Centralisation reduces the operation speed of the CPU and eventually

stops the system if the number of cars increases.

PRIVACY ISSUE

The centralised approach eventually threatens the privacy of the driver. If
someone can access the central server, you can access the personal

identification of all drivers as well as the driving record.

SAFETY ISSUE

A malicious attack on a car's network cannot be blocked 100% by current
security methods. Alternatives must be created in order to reach maximum

security.

Considering the weakness of conventional security methods, CUBE adopted
blockchain as a key security platform for autonomous car. Blockchain is a
distributed database that maintains a growing list of blocks that are chained to

each other. Blockchain is managed by a distributed peer to peer network.

There are various difficulties in applying traditional blockchain to autonomous
vehicle safety. Blockchain instantiations suffers from high overhead and low
scalability. All transactions and blocks are broadcast to the entire network

which results in extremely large packets.

CUBE Intelligence | Page 11

cube
© 1.2 CUBE AS A HYBRID BLOCKCHAIN

CUBE's autonomous vehicle security is based on decentralised blockchain
technology. Each entity is a node, making it basically the same as the security
systems running on Ethereum. However, in the case of an autonomous car,
there is a limit to the use of existing blockchain methods. Due to the blockchain’s
slow speed and scalability problems, the blockchain technique cannot be used
“as-is.” For this reason, CUBE has been preparing a hybrid chain.

Ali Dorri et al., ‘BlockChain: A Distributed Solution to Automotive Security and Privacy’,
IEEE Communications Magazine, 2017, pp2-3

CUBE is composed of hybrid blockchains that use public and private
blockchains together. When datafying a vehicle’s drive, tons of data is
generated, though the data varies depending on how the data was accumulated.
Even when counting only the driving information and the peripherally
recognised information used in datafication, enormous amounts of data (up to
ATB) are generated every day. This takes a lot of time to process or share. By
contrast, vehicles require fast data processing, transmission, and receipt to

prevent accidents.

The security of current autonomous vehicles is inefficient, in terms of velocity
and volume, when it comes to handling by the public blockchain. To date, we
have seen Hyperledger, the Linux Foundation’s Umbrella, and R3, in addition to
more than 75 banking consortiums around the world, as examples of private
blockchains. CUBE constitutes the private blockchain of autonomous cars,
operating as a private blockchain to solve the problems of velocity related to
data processing and volume. This, however, requires a very high level of trust in
critically important elements, such as firmware upgrades by automakers. Those
elements that require such a high level of trust will rely on public blockchains,

suchas Ethereum.

In summary, CUBE uses its own private blockchain, and also uses a public
blockchain for critically important elements; thus, CUBE is a hybrid blockchain

that can be used for all aspects of autonomous cars.

S 1.3 CUBE’S AUTOMOTIVE BLOCKCHAIN MAINNET

CUBE 's ultimate goal is to build an automotive blockchain mainnet, which will
require two steps. The first step is Over-the-Air (OTA). OTA is a technology that
remotely updates a car's firmware. OTA can easily and remotely update many
bugs in the car. These updates do not require high chain speeds since as they
only take about an hour; fast blockchain hashes are not seen. Therefore,
blockchain speed is not a major issue. CUBE will complete these technologies in

2018.

The second step is the autonomous car's security platform. The security of an
autonomous car requires high-speed confirmation of the incoming information.
It does not have to be too quick to receive simple navigation path information;
however, obstacle information and road information in front of the car require
very fast validation. Therefore, CUBE plans to apply one method of deep

learning for this rapid validation.

The application of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method, which is
quicker than gradient descent in deep running, is applied. SGD is a bit slower
than slow perfection and faster processing. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg says,

"Done is better than perfect".

Gradient descent uses the full-batch method to check all the cases and to make
decisions; however, it takes too much time. SGD uses the mini-batch method for

trial and error, but at a much faster rate.

Deep learning can provide a variety of applicable technologies for making
automotive blockchain. Momentum can be applied for faster blockchain speed
processing. The incoming information is considered validated once it is the
same. Nesterov's accelerated gradient (NAG) first predicts the incoming
information, and then calculates and checks the incoming information. AdaGrad
can be applied when you have not heard anything. AdaGrad is a way to search
more closely because it has not visited, yet. In this case, you can apply AdaDelta
to prevent it from stopping because it will slow down if you validate it too

precisely. Considering all these factors, Adam can be applied to a blockchain.

CUBE Intelligence | Page 13

cube
© 1.4 CUBE GOVERNANCE ISSUE

CUBE’s governance will come from the participating automakers and owners of
autonomous vehicles. Each participant becomes a node and has suffrage in the
main decision-making process. The cost of this transaction will be paid to the
carmakers as Proof of Share (POS). Automakers will have exclusive rights to data
upgrades that require high reliability, such as super nodes firmware for each

autonomous vehicle.

@ 1.5 DAAP BASED ON CUBE PLATFORM

CUBE is a hybrid blockchain platform that allows vehicles to easily share reliable
data peer to peer (p2p). On this platform, a variety of future Internet of Things
(loTs) (e.g., guidance assist loT, traffic information assist loT, collision avoidance

loT, etc.) can be easily shared with trust.

S 1.6 CUBE’S BLOCKCHAIN SECURITY OPERATION

CUBE solves these limitations of traditional BC technology with two concepts
of segmentation and permission. In the operation of autonomous vehicles,
many loTs provide information to autonomous vehicles. This information may be
transmitted directly between the loT and the vehicle or may be transmitted

through a center that controls the loT.

The invader may try to interfere between the traffic centre or lol and
autonomous vehicle by taking access to the main network. Eventually, the
invader can take control of the software binary with an intention of introducing

malware into a huge number of vehicles.

If an attacker enters a new information hash value is not associated with a chain
of existing blocks, it is considered a malicious attack. In case of important update
information, the CUBE platform and the automaker require multiple signatures

and only perform remote update if the two private keys match.

Figure 2

The data sent from the loT to the car includes information such as location
information and road conditions. Conversely, the information sent from the car
to the loT includes speed information and vehicle status information. For the
safety of autonomous vehicles, CUBE uses blockchain to handle
communication between these vehicles and the loT. Each of the lols becomes a
node and the autonomous vehicle becomes a node, as well. The data transfer

between these cars and the loT is considered a transaction.

Figure 3

The essential information used in another autonomous vehicle is self-driving
data provided by the automaker, the traffic management center, and so on. The
automaker must remotely monitor the status of the vehicle from autonomous
vehicles and remotely upgrade the firmware. The autonomous car should
receive only the authenticated data from the authenticated centre. The
authenticated centre should always be connected with the blockchain and
should be updated continuously. Most malicious entities will disguise
themselves using these centres, therefore this node is very important and needs

to be trusted.

Blockchain was originally characterised as permission-free, but since
communication with autonomous vehicles requires the highest security, only
autonomous vehicles should be allowed to communicate with permission.
Therefore, unlike the case with normal blockchain, the data should be processed
based on permission. To allow only authorised entities to access a node, CUBE
uses the concept of a super node. A super node plays an important role, such as
providing information to an autonomous vehicle and upgrading it, unlike a
general autonomous vehicle. These super nodes can be specified by the

automaker or the government.

CUBE Intelligence | Page 16

cube
SUB BLOCK

Figure 4

As seen in Figure 4, each sub-block works just like the current blockchain. It
updates every nodes’ transaction, such as traffic information, automakers’
hardware upgrade and navigation route information. The size of the sub-block is
relatively small, making the time to add a new block much faster than the current
method.

© 1.7 HAND SHAKING

If the autonomous vehicle's driving information needs to be handed over from
one base station to another, the data may be interrupted in the meantime. In this
case, the two base stations should negotiate so that the data can be transmitted
well so that the data is not disconnected. These two protocols are called hand
shaking. The handshaking process generally occurs to set up guidelines for
communication when a system tries to communicate with another device.
When a computer communicates with another device like a modem, printer, or

network server, it needs to handshake with it to establish a connection.

Handshaking can adjust factors that are suitable for systems and equipment at
all ends including coding alphabet, information transfer rate, interrupt

procedure, parity and some other hardware features.

CUBE Intelligence | Page 17

cube

Handshaking is a technique of communication between two entities. However,
within TCP/IP RFCs, the term "handshake" is most commonly used to reference
the TCP three-way handshake. A common handshaking protocol may include
the receiver delivering the message meaning -“I got your previous message and
you can send me the next one” "" A more complex handshaking protocol might
allow the sender to ask the receiver if it is ready to receive or for the receiver to
reply with a negative acknowledgment meaning “I did not receive your previous

message properly, kindly send it again”

@128 SINGLE-SIGNATURE AND MULTI-SIGNATURE

The way in which information comes into your car depends on how important
the information is. If the information is related to entertainment, it can be
accepted without any confirmation. However, the same level of traffic
information is secured with a single signature. If it is important information, such
as upgrading the car's firmware, a single signature is not enough. In this case, the
automotive manufacturer and the security platform of the CUBE must be
approved at the same time; a multisignature method is necessary for security

approval.
Ali Dorri et al has made the desirable validity checking method as follows:

“All transactions are broadcast to all OBMs. An OBM checks the validity of the
received transaction by verifying the affixed signature(s). If the transaction is
valid, then it is stored in a pool of valid transactions which will be collated to form
a block with a pre-defined block size, i.e., the total number of transactions stored
in the block.’ “A multisig transaction that arrives at the OBM may yet need to be
signed by the recipient, particularly when the recipient belongs to the cluster of
that OBM. Each OBM retains a catalog of PK pairs that produce nodes which are

permitted to communicate with each other.

The cluster members (i.e., overlay nodes) upload key pairs to the key list of their
OBM to allow other overlay nodes to access them In case the OBM discovers a
PK pair in its catalog that goes with the PKs in the operation then it processes
the transaction to the matching node which has uploaded the main pair. Or else,

the operation is transmitted to further OBMs.

2. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (Al)
DEEP LEARNING LAYER

To enhance the security level, artificial intelligence (Al) is applied at this stage.
Recently, attacks on hackers’ networks with malicious intent have rapidly been
evolving. Until now, however, cybersecurity technology has been a passive
method of collecting vaccines to defend against the attacks that have already
been perpetrated. Cube has developed deep learning network security where a
method is chosen based on predictions of malicious attacks that will occur,
rather than a passive approach that uses defensive (instead of active) methods.
CUBE will continue to learn how malicious attackers have attacked the network

to prevent future attacks.

CUBE’S SELF-TAUGHT LEARNING

An invasion detection system thinks of a common kind of attach situation,
where affected data packets are inserted into the in-vehicle Controller Area
Network (CAN) vehicle.

CUBE Intelligence | Page 19

cube

Artificial neural networks have not worked well in the past to protect against
these attacks, which is why new methods are needed. Three catalysts cause and
maintain the explosions of malicious data—new mathematical computations are
the spark, big data represent the fuel, and massive computation can be viewed
as the horsepower. Cube uses previous cases of malicious attacks to recognise
them. Cube allows the Al to train the Cube platform on cases of previous
malicious attacks and predict hundreds of millions of new possible malicious
attacks through this reinforcement learning. It then creates a defense system for

each case.

Cube employs TensorFlow, an open-source library built by Google. There are
many other ways of implementing deep running, but at present, TensorFlow has
the best position in the market. In addition, there are a lot of data going on while
watching the source code, which makes TensorFlow the most advantageous
library. TensorFlow is an open-source software library for numerical
computation using dataflow graphs; one reason for its popularity is that it can be

developed with Python.

A graph is a connection between one node and another, while a dataflow graph
is an operation. This edge is data to be easily said; this is called a data array.
TensorFlow enables calculations through this process, and the TensorFlow
runtime is a cross-platform library. Google designed TensorFlow for large-scale
distributed training and inference, but it is also flexible enough to support
experimentation with new machine learning models and system-level

optimisation.

CUBE Intelligence | Page 20

cube

Cube builds the first graph in TensorFlow. First, it can create a “placeholder”
node, and each node becomes a placeholder. When a placeholder is created, it
passes the value to the “feed data” as the graph runs through the session. This
graph is then executed and updated as needed, or it returns an output indicating
whether a malicious attack has occurred. A large quantity of data must be input
regarding previous malicious attacks in order to make the output more accurate.
CUBE’s neural network is initially trained by being fed large amounts of data.
Training consists of providing input and asking the network what the output
should be. For example, to build a network for identifying malicious attacks, the
initial training may include a series of past malicious attacks. Each input is
accompanied by the matching identification. Providing the answers allows the
model to adjust its internal weightings to learn how to do its job better. For
example, if nodes A1, B1, and C1 tell node D1 that the current input data
represent a malicious attack, while node E11 says they are normal data, and the
training program confirms a malicious attack, CUBE will decrease the weight it

assigns to E1's input and increase the weight given toA1, B1, and C1.

CUBE’S SELF-TAUGHT LEARNING

Cube uses a neural network to determine the malicious attacks expected in the
future. In fact, neural networks do not always provide good results. There are
three problems with such networks, namely underfitting, low speed, and
overfitting. Underfitting refers to a problem whereby the learning is insufficient.
Low speed is an issue where it takes too long to learn. Finally, overfitting means
that the network is inflexible, even when it has learned. These three problems

make a neural network's results unreliable.

UNDERFITTING

The first problem, underfitting, means that learning is not effective enough. A
neural networklearns via backpropagation. It updates itself by repeating the
processes of differentiation, multiplication, and adding, and all in vice versa. The
problem, however, is that a sigmoid function is used for activation. We have
found a repeated issue with the vanishing gradient phenomenon: As the layer
becomes deeper, the updates disappear. Therefore, underfitting occurs, which

results in poor fitting.

Instead of a vanishing sigmoid, Cube uses an activation function that does not
disappear. Specifically, rectified linear units (ReLUs) are used as the activation

function. This solves the problems related to the vanishing gradient.

LOW SPEED

The second problem to be solved for neural networks is the low speed problem.
Existing neural networks have used gradient descent (GD) to optimise the
weighting parameters. The gradient is obtained from the current weight of the
loss (or cost) function, and it is updated to reduce the loss. To put it briefly, this is
wrong (Slide 35). There are hundreds of millions of training data on hacking, and
if we consider those hundreds of millions of hits each time we hit a mark, the
network will slow down significantly. This raises the following question: Could
there not be a faster optimiser than GD? Here, we find the stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) method. The concept of SGD is that it is a method that can be
completed quickly, even if the results are not perfectly accurate. As Mark
Zuckerberg has said, “Done is better than perfect.” Gradient descent is amethod
that takes one step after a full batch; in contrast, SGD uses mini-batches and

moves forward step by step.

CUBE Intelligence | Page 22

cube

Cube employs Adam as an improved version of SGD. Combining the advantages
of RMSProp + Momentum, this solution is suitable in terms of both the step size
and direction. In the future, we can consider attaching NAG to Adam instead of

Momentum.

OVERFITTING

The final problem with neural networks is their inflexibility. To solve this
problem, we can deliberately omit information or turn off the intermediate
nodes when training a neural network. Dropout lets us learn what the important
factors are without obsessing over specific parts. Thus, the problem of

overfitting relates to obtaining flexibility without dropout.

Cube solves the three problems related to neural networks, namely underfitting,
low speed, and overfitting. The problem that Cube is trying to solve is not
snapshot data like images, but sequential data that discriminate whether the
signals are malicious attacks. Hence, Cube uses a recent neural network (RNN)

orlong short-term memory (LSTM).

TRANSPARENCY POLICY

CUBE considers transparency to be of the utmost importance. CUBE has

established policy for transparent operations and will execute the following:

1.) CUBE shall publish monthly operational reports and financial reports to
contributors to share the operational status of the company after token
distribution.

2.) When hiring new staff members, such as new developers, CUBE shall
build up a validation process as well as thoroughly examining portfolios from
past and set the reward policies in accordance with their abilities.

3.) The company's budget shall be tightly managed so that it would always be

possible to operate and manage the company without additional funding for
more than three years.

CUBE Intelligence | Page 24

cube
CONTRIBUTORS COMMUNICATION

1.) CUBE shall send a monthly report every month to share important company’s
update, after the token distribution.

2.) In case of an important occasion, CUBE must share the important matters by
emailimmediately.

3.) Follow CUBE’s social media accounts for live company updates and to

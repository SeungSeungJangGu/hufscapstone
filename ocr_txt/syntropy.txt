A Blockchain-backed Inter-Provider Segment Routing WAN v1.3

A Blockchain-backed Internet Segment Routing WAN (SR-WAN)

Whitepaper by NOIA Network

William B. Norton wbn@noia.network, Jonas Simanavicius jonas@noia.network

Abstract— Barely a day goes by without a news report of
some Internet infrastructure failure that impacted end-users
across the Internet. There is often nothing affected users can
do but wait for the storm to pass, and resume when
connectivity is restored.

Segment Routing has emerged from the IETF as a source
routing RFC that can force network traffic to, and then
through, a pre-defined sequence of relays called segment
routers. Each segment router replaces the destination
address with the address of the next segment to visit on
towards the destination. This enables end-systems to force
traffic along a network path that bypasses areas of network
degradation.

This paper is divided into two halves. The first half presents
a model for an inter-provider public Segment Routing WAN
(SR-WAN) that provides hosts (Mac, PC, Linux) with
additional paths through the Internet. This is done using
segment routing across network paths shared by the others
connected to the SR-WAN. Blockchain is used as the
distributed ledger for providers and consumers of spare
compute and bandwidth. The second half of the paper
focuses on private SR-WANs, with commercially operated
segment routers operating in well-connected Internet
colocation centers. Both the public and the private SR-WANs
share a common distributed database of segments available
for use or purchase.

1. INTERNET VARIABILITY

The public Internet is composed of autonomous Internet
Service Providers (ISPs), interconnected in arms-length
distance relationships called “Internet Transit” and “Internet
Peering.” Both of these relationships provide connectivity to
the public Internet, or portions of it, respectively.
Importantly, packets are exchanged between these networks
without consideration of the quality of the network paths
enabled. As a result, routers will blindly forward traffic
across lossy congested links.

Beyond occasional packet loss the public Internet is
increasingly experiences latency fluctuations. To illustrate,
one of the authors conducted inter-cloud measurements
between 25 cloud instances across the AWS, Google, and
Azure clouds in 2017. This study quantified the variability in
packet delivery between the clouds, spotlighting latencies
that deviated from the median latency measurement by more

than 20%!. These types of latency anomalies appeared almost
every day (see graph in Figure 1 for an example).

Figure 1 - Example of latency anomalies common on the
Internet

Research with the cloud network operators identified the
cause of this variability to be a MPLS traffic engineering
technique called ‘“‘auto-optimization.” This is a router
configuration instructing the MPLS underlayment to balance
the router load evenly across the underlying transport links.
When end-system traffic traverses these paths the latency can
vary by up to 100ms for minutes or hours. This variability of
course is detrimental to latency-sensitive applications, but
also leads to variability in connection time and effective
thruput.

Internet performance variability also comes from the
Internet inter-domain routing system. The Internet Society
reported 14,000 routing outages, leaks and hijacks in 2017.
Most recently (June 2019), Allegheny Technologies Inc., a
metals manufacturer, misconfigured its router leading to
widespread partial and complete Internet connectivity
failures.

All three of these examples led to Internet end-users
routinely experience periods of poor performance for minutes
or hours. When connectivity is lost or crippled, there is no
general recourse but to complain to your provider and wait
for the connectivity to recover, accepting that the public
Internet has periods of intermittent network degradation.

Until now.
2. A PUBLIC SEGMENT ROUTING SYSTEM

A public segment routing system brings the wisdom of
crowds and a technology called “Segment Routing” to the
public Internet. The Segment Routing WAN (SR-WAN)
continually measures and enumerates a list of alternative

cloud-premium-william-b-norton/

network paths through the public Internet using segment
routers operated by the SR-WAN community of users.

This “sharing economy” model enables connectivity for
partially isolated users to leverage the better connectivity of
other users. Network traffic is relayed through a path of
participating segment routers (called a “Segment Router
Path,” or a “SRPath’”)

The block chain provides accounting for the community,
rewarding utility tokens to those who relay the traffic for
others, which can be applied when connectivity is
problematic for the segment router operator.

2.1 Overview

The nodes of the SR-WAN operate segment routers. In the
public SR-WAN, the segment router is software (open-
source virtual router that runs in a container on your host.)

Each segment router packet contains the addresses of
segment routers to visit before delivering the packet to the

final destination. This source-routing system ”routes around”
congested paths as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 — Routing Internet traffic around a congested path

Much like MPLS is called a network underlayment acting as
“Layer 2.5,” the SR-WAN can be thought of as a network
veneer acting as “Layer 3.5.” Both plug into routers, and
apply hardware to optimize either utilization of links or
utilization of transit bandwidth respectively.

2.2 Components of the Public SR-WAN System
There are five main elements to the public SR-WAN system:

2.2.1 Ingress/Egress Segment Router

Traffic enters the segment routing system via an “Ingress
Segment Router” and sent out to the final destination via an
“Egress Segment Router.” For the purposes of this part of the
paper, a “segment router” refers collectively to the segment
router and support systems running in a docker on your host
(PC,Mac,Linux).

SR-WAN Docker

Figure 3 - Public SR-WAN Segment Router on the host

The docker provides an isolated environment for the
segment routing software and supporting systems.

2.2.2 The SR-WAN Controller

The SR-WAN controller kick starts off the segment
routing system with the assignment of segment routers into
segment router groups.

Segment router groups scale to up to 100. One segment
router in each group periodically communicates the group’s
collective network state to the controller.

The controller converts the performance matrices into a
database of available network segments and their recently
measured network performance characteristics. This
authoritative decentralized database is called the Distributed
Transit Exchange (DITEX).

2.2.3 Segment Router Pulse

All segment routers are assigned to groups that “pulse”
one another with their state information. This accomplishes
two things:

First, it provides the payload to measure one-way latency
between all segment routers in the group.

Secondly, each segment router can then construct a full
matrix of one-way latency measurements which can be
used to determine if there is a better path towards the
destination through the segment router system.

Note that round trip measurements (i.e. ping) are too
inaccurate as they conflate the performance of two distinct
network paths, and are therefore not an accurate reflection
of the performance of packets directed one-way through
the segment routing system.

2.2.3 First and Last Hops

To match the destination addresses to nearby segment
routers for ingress and egress, the segment routers and
destination addresses are tagged to a geolocation:ASN tuple.
This enables an Internet packet to be directed to an
appropriate egress segment router when the SR-WAN
provides a better performing path.

When an egress router receives the segment routing packet,
it forwards the original packet on to the destination. During
each transfer, each segment router calculates the one-way
latency and thruput observed through the segment routing
path. This path is called an “extraordinary path” and
becomes part of the state information propagated across the
group. This also allows the system to autonomously compare
the calculated latency expected against the actual latency.

The DITEX holds the SR-WAN segment state, and supports
several uses. First, the DITEX provides data for group
assignment. Secondly, the DITEX provides some network
accounting data for validators and for smart contracts.
Thirdly, the DITEX holds the data for path performance
validation to identify “bad actor” and “poor performer”
segment routers and quarantine them into groups. Fourth, the
DITEX provides the global perspective required to optimize
inter-group traffic across the global SR-WAN ecosystem.

2.2.5 Blockchain

Blockchain is the distributed ledger technology used to
settle between suppliers and consumers of the collective
resources of the SR-WAN. Utility tokens (aka “NOIA
coins”) are earned for traffic relayed for others, and utilized
when they themselves wish to utilize the SR-WAN (ie. its
default Internet path is congested.)

Network data is continuously collected by the segment
router and presented to the controller in the form of a ‘ticket’
along with group statistics. Validators verify the network
statistics that accompany the claim for reward, and add the
transaction to the blockchain so coins are transferred to the
NOIA wallet of the bandwidth supplier as shown in Figure 5.

The validators (Master Nodes) earn tokens for validating
transactions in the DITEX.

There are two sources of tokens for rewarding validators.
First, every transaction on the ledger generates a small
transaction fee. This transaction fee pool is also subsidized
systematically for the first three years. Transaction fees are
allocated to a validator pool (25%) and a dividend pool
(75%).

The dividend pool is rewarded to the top voted NOIA
wallets. This approach provides an incentive for large token
holders to get and share dividend yields, while maintaining a
healthy token velocity. Coin holders can “vote” their coins
with others to form groups to increase their chances of being
part of one of the reward wallets and receive a portion of the
dividend pool. These “votes” have no impact on the holders’
wallet, but rather provide a means for smaller wallets to
participate in the dividend pool reward.

Decentralized Internet Transit Exchange: Utilization of
Transit Capacity.”

2.3 The Public SR-WAN Supports the Sharing Economy

There are many concepts, such as collaborative consumption
peer-to-peer markets (i.e. BitTorrent), and access-based
consumption (i.e. airBnB), which can all be put under the
umbrella term of sharing economy. The public SR-WAN
brings forward a new example of a sharing economy that
satisfies all seven criteria enumerated by Hawlitchek .et. al.”:

1. Increasing utilization rates. The Internet has
spare capacity.

2. Peer-to-peer principle. Transactions are between
buyer and seller.

3. Existence of reimbursement. Coins are rewarded
for use of resources.

4. No transfer of ownership. The resource is used
and then is available for others.

5. Resource tangibility. To participate, one shares
part of their computer. The location of that
computer makes it more or less attractive to the
community of users.

6. Leveraging of information systems. Machine
learning systems are applied to the data to optimize

the routing system and settlement is done via
modern block chain.

7. Temporariness. Access to infrastructure is granted
for the short period of time.

The public SR-WAN demonstrates all of these
characteristics and so meets the definition of a sharing
economy. Network segments provided by a segment router
are the commodities with intrinsic value, the seller grants
access and the buyer consumes the resource, after which the
buyer and seller settle with blockchain.

3. A DAY IN THE LIFE OF ASR-WAN SEGMENT ROUTER

To illustrate the system, let’s follow the money for a 1GB
use.

Assume each NOIA coin has a nominal price of $0.05
USD. Further assume that the cost to relay traffic through the
public SR-WAN is $0.50 per GB. Each segment router earns
a share of the $0.50, proportionate to the number of relays in
the path’ as shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7 - Segment Routers earn tokens to the proportion of
their participation in the path

After the software is downloaded and installed in the
docker, there are six interactions.

3.1. Initialization

The segment router connects to the controller to receive
its configuration (including geolocation:ISP tuple) and its
group number. Coins are deposited in escrow for use when
traffic is sent to the SR-WAN.

3.2. Pulse

Each segment router periodically (every 10 seconds for
example) pulses their state information to all others in the
group, so every member of the group knows each other’s
geolocation, ISP and one-way latency for traffic sent to
them. This full matrix enables each segment router to
calculate aggregate path latency that can be compared
against the default Internet path latency.

3 The allocation formula is a bit more complicated than this; each node
earns proportionate to how many segment routers are in the path modulo a
piece allocated to the operation of the shared infrastructure.

3.3. Detection

Most of the time, the system operates in pass-through
mode, forwarding traffic on to the default gateway. The
system looks up the geolocation:ISP tuple to find the best
egress segment router for target destinations. A list of
alternative routes is calculated and compared to default
Internet routing performance.

3.4. Reroute through the Public SR-WAN

When congestion is detected in the form of packet loss or
latency variance, etc., a segment router packet is constructed
with the original packet as payload, and with the segment
routers to visit listed in the segment router packet.

This segment router packet is sent to the first segment router
in the path. Every router along the path forwards to the next
segment router hop. Along the path, each segment router
counts the amount of traffic sent and received by each other
segment router.

3.5. Delivery of original packet to the destination

When the egress router receives the packet, it unpacks the
original packet and sends it onto the destination. Note that
this packet originated elsewhere in the Internet, so may be
filtered by ISPs implementing BCP-38. A variety of
techniques can be used to address this.

3.5. Blockchain settlement

After relaying 1GB, each segment router sends a claim
‘ticket’ to the controller with its state (including counter
values like bootTime, totalTrafficIn, totalTrafficOut, and
InOctets/OutOctets from each segment router). Validators
review the group accounting data and transfer the coins from
consumer’s escrow to the provider’s NOIA wallet.

The egress router also stores the performance statistics of
these “exceptional paths” as part of its state.

Each segment router provides a portal (Web page) to
provide feedback to the operator such as coins earned, coins
applied, and traffic relayed. The dashboard also shows a live
latency matrix of the SR-WAN from the perspective of the
operator segment router.

For most users, the SR-WAN is a set it and forget it
docker appliance. By participation they earn the right to use
the segment router paths of others. NOIA Coins/Tokens
ensure fair sharing.

4. SR-WAN INCENTIVES
This public SR-WAN provides three powerful incentives.

1. It encourage operators to leave their segment routers
running all the time to garner more coin,

2. It supports good networks. Segment routers on good
networks attract more packets to relay and therefore earn
more coin,

3. Its value grows as the network grows. As the network
grows, the number and diversity of quality paths increases,
and therefore increases the value derived by the community.

5. SR-WAN LEVERAGES MARKET FORCES
The SR-WAN leverages several current market forces:

5.1. Universality of fixed-price Internet Transit
Internet Transit provides connectivity to any endpoint on
the Internet. The SR-WAN leverages this fact to reach the
segment routers on other Internet transit services.

Since these services imbue customers with a fixed price
for all the Internet traffic they can consume or produce
(up to a limit), there is no additional cost to participate in
the SR-WAN. Participation in the SR-WAN utilizes spare
compute and bandwidth. And since the price of Internet
Transit historically drops every year from about 20-30%",
the cost of participation in the SR-WAN is expected to
drop every year.

5.2. Acceptance of open-source distributed systems software

The world is shifting to open-source. In particular, the
popularity and acceptance of open-source software today
facilitates the acceptance of distributed systems such as
this. Containers provide isolation between the client
environment and the segment router. Frameworks like
NodeJS ease the development of distributed systems,
Express externalizes instrumentation as web pages and
RESTful APIs. All of these open-source components are
widely accepted and deployed today, providing the
project with production-ready off-the-shelf building
blocks to build a cooperative networked system.

5.3 Desire to participate in Crypto Currency

The rise in Bitcoin value to over $13,000° in 2019 has
propelled cryptocurrency into the limelight and fueled
speculative investment into digital assets. This SR-WAN
automatically rewards NOIA coins for participation in the
network, so provides a free and easy way to participate in
the cryptocurrency market system. One can simply run
some code and obtain crypto currency in return. While
not the intent of the system, we acknowledge this strong
allure.

5.4. Machine Learning is now accessible and applicable

The SR-WAN generates real-time network segment
performance data that enables machine-learning systems
to identify patterns in the data for use in dynamic routing.

Machine learning is utilized to automatically identify
trends and optimally group to shift collectives of traffic
along better segment-routed paths dynamically.

5.5 Emergence of Segment Routing from the IETF

About a dozen draft and full standards surrounding
segment routing have emerged from the IETF, driven
largely by Cisco Systems. Cisco enables routers to execute

segment routing in hardware. While the public SR-WAN
virtual router only leverages a small subset of features
documented in the specifications, the marketing and
technical support from major hardware vendors improves
the chances of broader adoption of segment routing
systems such as this.

5.6 The First Mover Advantage

The SR-WAN demonstrates network externality properties;
the value of the SR-WAN is proportional to the number of
nodes in the network and the quality of the paths they bring.
Therefore, late entrants into the market will have to compete
for users against an established and growing network that is
generating coins of increasing value for them. This provides
a sustainable competitive advantage for the first SR-WAN
with a critical mass of segment routers.

8. SR-WAN USE CASES
There are several use cases envisioned for the SR-WAN.

8.1 Route Around Congestion

This is the normative case. On the public Internet, routers
continue to send traffic along a congested path shown in red
in Figure 8.

Figure 8 - Detection and bypassing congested network paths

As described earlier, the SR-WAN paths are constantly
being compared and the SR-WAN path is used when better.
When the regular Internet path returns to normalcy the
default Internet path is once again preferred.

8.2 Buy cheap network bandwidth but use a better
network

Since the Internet transit service provides access to any
attached Internet device, there is nothing stopping one from
simply forcing all of their traffic to a segment router sitting
on an empirically better network. This traffic will be
received by the segment router on the premium network and
A Blockchain-backed Inter-Provider Segment Routing WAN v1.3

forwarded onto its destination across the premium network
path.

8.3. A Cost Effective Intranet

A cost-competitive alternative to MPLS can be constructed
for small and medium-sized businesses over other peoples
segment routers. This could deliver encrypted network
segments between offices. Since Internet transit is always
dropping in price, one can construct a private network
solution at a fraction of the cost of current MPLS solutions,
and the costs are expected to drop 20%-30% per year from
there!

9. Improve Security-Control and Visibility

The future of cyber security is adaptive and responsive,
something the SR-WAN is particularly well suited to do.
State-sponsored cyber attacks leverage automated attack
systems, so detection, mitigation and data collection systems
must be automated as well. The SR-WAN system provides
greater control and visibility than sending traffic over the
public Internet alone.

Control. The SR-WAN is driven by a constant flow of
performance data fed into an Al/machine learning system.
This system dynamically re-groups segment routers based
empirically on network performance reported by the
receiving routers. This enables the re-routing of traffic
dynamically based on current measurements and training
models. This data collection and feedback mechanism
enables the controller to adjust groupings based on measured
one-way latency between ingress and egress systems.

Visibility. Each segment router provides the operator with
visibility into the segment routing paths available. The
segment routing instrumentation is a constantly updated web
page run from within the segment router docker. Here the
system shows uptime, coins earned, the traffic relayed, and a
matrix of real-time performance data.

The matrix provides users with current network state as seen
by the segment router, highlighting paths where improved
traffic performance brings opportunities for better
connectivity.

10. DITEX PREMIUM BANDWIDTH USE CASES

“The most powerful asset in the digital age is data®.” — Don

Tascott

As introduced earlier, the Distributed Internet Transit
Exchange (DITEX) holds the repository of available
network segments and their performance characteristics, pre-
populated from the segments available on the public SR-
WAN.

° “How the blockchain is changing money and business,” TEDSummit
June 2016

Additional segments and paths can be listed on the DITEX
with coin premiums associated with them. For example,
commercial operators can sell premium segments with
automated smart contracts. The blockchain is used for
settlement between the buyer and seller, with a micro
transaction fee allocated to the DITEX operations.

10.1 Use case: Monetize spare capacity

To illustrate a DITEX premium bandwidth use case,
consider the Spread Network link between Chicago and New
York. Spread Networks spent a lot of money to tunnel
through the mountains to build a fiber path with the lowest
possible latency. This exceptionally low latency path is
expensive to lease, but is critical for automated trading
during business hours. The demand curve for this circuit is
shown in the graph, highlighting six hours of unused
capacity before and after the workday.

Spare Capacity

Figure 9 - Off-hours bandwidth available and monetized as
network segments

This off-hours capacity can be monetized by simply running
segment routers on either side of the link and listing them on
the DITEX. With its empirically measured lower latency,
this link will attract traffic, and its operator will receive
coins for its use during those off-hours. The listing of the
bandwidth can be anonymous and can be time-delineated, so
there is no market cannibalization or impact on most-
favored-nation-termed contracts.

10.2 Use case: Network-as-a-Service

Setting up a traditional network is both time and capital
intensive. Shifting from networking physical routers to
networking virtual routers only gets you half way there. The
DITEX provides the missing piece: the directory of available
resources that can be stitched together to create virtual
network required. Since this virtual network rides on top of
the Internet, it has maximal reach. Since it rides on the
Internet it also inherits the path diversity across many
networks.

10.3 Use case: Purchase Better Internet On-Demand

Some enterprises may want to leverage the path diversity
during times of crisis, but not forward segment routing
A Blockchain-backed Inter-Provider Segment Routing WAN v1.3

traffic on behalf of others. The DITEX enables the purchase
of coins for use if and when the segment routing path is
used. This mode of operation is implemented by setting the
price of the enterprise’s segment links to infinity in the
DITEX. This will in effect make these segments unavailable
for others to use but still allow it to participate in the latency
measurements so it knows when the SR-WAN provides an
empirically better path. This configuration will generate no
coins for the enterprise, but still allow the enterprise to
participate in the group pulse and engage better paths with
purchased coins when desired.

11. A PRIVATE SEGMENT ROUTING WAN

The Private Segment Routing WAN (Private SR-WAN)
leverages the same technology as the public SR-WAN but
utilizes professionally operated segment routers in native
IPv6 Segment Routers (SRv6), collocated in well-populated
Internet colocation centers. The operators of the
infrastructure purchase Internet Transit from ISPs that have
peering with the regional eyeball networks to produce the
lowest latency paths.

While these deployments are expensive, the performance
characteristics are perfect for emerging latency sensitive and
business critical edge applications. A single regional
deployment can provide direct reach to 80% of the market
within 25ms. This brings premium performance segments
into the DITEX.

Deployments will match the eight interconnection regions
across the U.S.: Seattle, Bay Area, Los Angeles, Chicago,
Dallas, Ashburn, Newark, and Atlanta as shown in Figure
10.

Figure 10 - Proposed US deployments (reach 80% of market
within 25ms)

In Europe, to reach 80% of a region within 25 milliseconds
one needs good connectivity to 5-8 eyeball networks. Here
again, transit from well-peered ISPs can be used to reach
these regional eyeballs in London, Amsterdam, Frankfurt,
and Paris.

i Ay

(twas | 4 Fae

Figure 11 - Proposed European Deployments (reach 80% of
market within 25ms)

Each deployment also leverages market competition for
transit. Historically transit is 10-20% cheaper in a popular
colocation center as compared with a corporate data center.
Since the colocation centers house the transit providers core
routers, the segment router operator is really only depending
on and paying for its Internet traffic to travel across a single
router backplane.

Each professional deployment provides multi-homed
segment routers. This brings a richer selection of paths than
the average public SR-WAN has access to. Peering at the
dominant [XP enables peering for additional direct reach.

It is important to note that the cost of Internet transit services
is borne by the segment router operator. There are usually
volume discounts and minimum traffic volume
commitments with Internet Transit purchases, so the
professional operator will have spare capacity if they fail to
meet their traffic commitments. In this case, the operator has
purchased spare capacity and is compensated in NOIA coins.

While NOIA is prepared to roll out a private SR-WAN as a
proof of concept, its preference is to engage with and
coordinate other with interested parties.

12. FUTURE USE CASES

Several future use cases are interesting to consider.

MPLS Supplement or Replacement. Current network
operators can supplement MPLS offerings to enterprises
with a lower cost private SR-WAN over the public Internet.
This solution rides on top of a plethora of diverse Internet
transit paths. This solution replaces partially utilized MPLS
links with more efficiently utilized Internet bandwidth.

Network Last Mile. Many network operators do not have
an inventory of last mile transport to bring customers onto
A Blockchain-backed Inter-Provider Segment Routing WAN v1.3

their network. This segment routing system could be used to
construct a public Internet on-ramp onto any physical
network.

Service Level Agreement Token Escrow An ISP may
escrow coins for customers to use in the event of congestion
or packet loss across their network. This form of SLA goes
beyond credits for downtime; it pays for tokens to bypass
congestion or faults in the provider’s network if at all
possible.

Virtual Circuits. One could construct heuristics that spread
the offered load across multiple SR-Paths with the same
performance characteristics. By sending the traffic in round-
robin pattern, the system learns more about the path
characteristics and more users are rewarded with coin. In
this way, last mile capacity can be aggregated into larger
capacity bandwidth chunks.

Content Distribution Systems. A CDN can leverage the
SR-WAN to populate caches deep in the last mile networks.
Operators of the segment routers receive coin for the traffic
exchanged, so caching provides one more reason why their
segment routers receive traffic.

13. CONCLUSION

The Segment Routing WAN brings together buyers and
sellers of spare Internet connectivity using rewards for
participation and relaying, and a community block chain for
settlement.

The public SR-WAN involves installing free open-source
software in a docker container on a host system. Coins are
earned and used by the host to gain access to a better
Internet.

The private SR-WAN brings professional operators
running hardware SRv6 nodes at well-populated colocation
environments to enterprises seeking optimized connectivity
for business-critical applications.

Abstract

The technology that brought us the first transparent, secure, and decentralized currency
through Bitcoin has opened the floodgates for incredibly innovative business solutions
through smart contracts on networks such as the Ethereum Network. Through this, a large
number of businesses have minted a growing group of people with significant wealth tied

to cryptocurrencies.

However, as it stands, the process to translate the wealth accumulated in cryptocurren-
cies to real-life experiences for cryptocurrency owners to enjoy is, unfortunately, painfully
inconvenient. The activities of purchasing, transferring, and exchanging cryptocurrencies

to widely accepted “money” are complicated, slow, and unstable.

The real-world usability problems associated with cryptocurrencies have encouraged a
number of companies to tackle this challenge. While many of the contenders in this space
have approached it with a seemingly logical prepaid plastic card solution, their use cases
are limited to just a few cryptocurrencies and acceptances are limited to just a small

number of Merchants, thus, hampering wider adoption.

In this regard, FuzeX is looking beyond the standard approaches. The team at FuzexX is
seeking to deliver an innovative user experience as well as solving the cryptocurrency

usability problem by introducing the Fuzex Ecosystem.
Vision
The FuzeX Team strives to make all forms of currency

payment (fiat, rewards and cryptocurrencies] secure,
reliable and User/Merchant friendly. y) y)

With the wider acceptance of blockchain technology and its innovative financial solutions,
cryptocurrencies are closer to being recognized as “money” more than ever. After all, it

has all the features of what is accepted as “money”.

Cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin or Ethereum, all share the following characteristics that

help define “money”:

Easy
Storage

However, when it comes to the usability characteristic of “money”, cryptocurrencies face a

Portability

Authenticity Difficultly

Verification Counterfeiting

serious challenge.

Our vision at FuzeX is to break down the “nice to own, but difficult to spend” problem with
cryptocurrency and help bring to completion its journey as a widely recognized and accepted
form of “money”. We seek to solve this usability issue of cryptocurrency by combining our
experience in payment solutions and blockchain technology with our technical know-how

in software and hardware development.
The FuzeX Ecosystem

The FuzeX Card

In building FuzeX, we draw from our experience
and expertise in having already successfully 3 XFUZEX
developed, brought to market, sold and shipped
30,000+ Fuze Cards (magnetic strip and barcode @BICON 010s

12BTC
enabled), which are smart e-cards that enable SAGER Lad

users to embed up to 30 credit, debit, or reward

cards in one.

The FuzeX Card will include all the features of the Fuze Card with the additional benefit
of multi-cryptocurrency integration. The FuzexX Card is identical in size and thickness to
a standard credit or debit card and consists of an EMV chip, a dynamic magnetic strip, an
E-Paper Display (EPD), three input/option buttons, a rechargeable battery and a charging

terminal.

Features of the FuzeX Card:

« Store, manage and use up to 30 credit, debit, reward and cryptocurrency accounts

Built-in buttons to power on/off, enter pin codes, make selections, and authorize

E-Paper Display (EPD] to view balances across accounts, barcodes for reward card

scans, and QR codes for blockchain addresses

EMV (IC Chip] for multi-cryptocurrency payments

Near Field Communication (NFC) for credit and debit card payments

Barcodes for reward payments

QR Code for cryptocurrency wallet addresses for P2P transfers

Bluetooth connection between FuzeX Card and FuzeX Wallet to ensure security
(Users have the additional option to securely lock the FuzeX Card when the

Bluetooth connection is disconnected)

Remote wipe technology to clear data from the FuzeX Card

Battery life between 45~60 days

Plus a sleek, slim, rechargeable portable battery bank

’ N

Once users have connected their various accounts (credit, debit, rewards or cryptocurren-
cy) to the FuzeX Ecosystem through their FuzeX Wallet app, they will be able to pay with

their FuzeX Card without the trouble of having to pull out their smartphones.

Furthermore, the FuzeX Card pairs with the FuzeX Wallet to function as a hard wallet stor-
age of private keys. Fragmented private keys are encrypted and stored between the FuzeX
Card and FuzeX Wallet. The private keys are only accessible by unlocking the FuzeX Card

(via a pin on the card) and FuzeX Wallet (via an account password).

As devices become increasingly more important in a person’s identity, this two-factor
authentication process helps combat fraud and brings together fragmented financial

platforms in to one simple solution.

..
The FuzeX Wallet

As the hub for the FuzeX Card and account management, the FuzeX Wallet allows

users to store, spend, receive, and transfer tokens.

The FuzeX Exchange

The FuzeX Exchange is the core, backend platform bringing world-wide cryptocurrency
adoption to reality. Our goal is to allow users to spend cryptocurrency on their FuzeX Card as
they would do on any regular credit card, and for Merchants to receive fiat currencies (USD,
Euro, Yen and any other local currencies) as they currently do. In fact, besides the eye-catch-

ing futuristic look and feel of the card, Merchants will not know the difference.

We accomplish this by enabling whichever cryptocurrency the FuzeX Card User selects to be
released in the respective fiat currency to Issuers, based on the relevant market exchange

rate. Our FuzexX Card will work in conjunction with EMV POS terminal standards. In doing so,
we eliminate the unreasonable overhead required in order for each cryptocurrency company

to establish contracts with each separate vendors.

To bring to market our solution for cryptocurrency usability sooner, FuzeX will first partner
with existing exchanges (Q2} and Issuers (Q2). For partner exchanges, the FuzeX Card offers
a unique solution that streamlines cryptocurrency adoption and increases their user base.
Alternatively, for the Issuers, the FuzeX card provides new access to an expanding, billion
dollar, industry. Following this development, FuzeX will then build out its own Centralized

FuzeX Exchange.
Features of the FuzeX Exchange:

Hold a multitude of reserve cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies to facilitate
real-time exchange (exchange rates derived from aggregated market rates) between
cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies for payment transactions

Function as a hosted wallet that is secured by 3 multi-signature security keys (User
Key, Exchange Key, and Isolated Key for recovery]

*Transactions execute only when 2 of the 3 security keys are deployed.

Integrate with Issuers/Legacy Payment Networks (e.g. MasterCard, Visa) to confirm
sufficient fiat equivalent cryptocurrency balance in the Users’ accounts during pay-
ment authorization and releases fiat payments to Issuers

Acknowledge selected cryptocurrency for payment when the User holds the relevant
button to confirm selection on their FuzeX Card

If Users lose their User Key, upon verification of identification, they can create a new
account and User Key. FuzeX can then transfer the balance from their previous

account to a new account using a combination of the Exchange Key and Isolated Key.

To maintain a balance of reserve cryptocurrency and fiat currency funds in the FuzeX Ex-

change, the FuzeX Exchange will offer any excess cryptocurrencies it receives from us-

ers to the market (via other exchange partnerships) to maintain proper reserve funds for

transactions. Revenue received from selling and appreciation of cryptocurrencies in FuzeX

Exchange’s ownership will be used to hedge currency fluctuation risks.

Setup

| 1. The User downloads the FuzeX Wallet [mobile app), creates an account to join the
FuzeX Exchange, and orders a FuzeX Card.

| 2. The User transfers the desired amount of cryptocurrencies from an external wallet
to the FuzeX Wallet.

3. The User receives and activates the FuzeX Card using the FuzeX Wallet app.

Transaction Flow

1. The User makes a purchase by selecting his/her choice of cryptocurrency from the

FuzeX Card, using the built-in buttons on the card.
2. The User views the selected cryptocurrency balance and the respective fiat currency

value, given in real time exchange rates on the FuzeX Card.

* When a cryptocurrency is selected and confirmed by the User (by holding down
the designated button), the selection information is sent directly to the FuzeX
Exchange.
3. The User hands over his/her FuzeX Card to the Merchant to insert or swipe.

* The Merchant's POS terminal sends a request to the relevant switch company or
Issuer to verify the User and authorize the payment via the EMV payment networks
(VISA, MasterCard, etc.).

* The Issuer (integrated with the FuzeX Exchange] checks the User’s account for
sufficient fiat equivalent cryptocurrency amount via the FuzeX Exchange.

* If sufficient, the Issuer authorizes the payment which simultaneously locks the
spent amount of cryptocurrency from the User’s account. [If there is an insufficient

amount, the Issuer denies the payment.)

4. The Merchant then receives authorization for the payment and the purchase is complete.

5. The User receives a courtesy purchase summary on his/her FuzeX Wallet app.

¢ The User must approve transactions on the FuzeX Card when the cumulative
spending balance surpasses $300 USD (limit adjustable] to finalize the transfer

of cryptocurrency payment from his/her User account to the FuzeX Exchange.

When the User approves transactions on his/her Fuzex Card, the cryptocurrency payment
is transferred to the FuzeX Exchange, which holds a multitude of reserve cryptocurrencies
and fiat currencies to facilitate payment transactions. The FuzeX Exchange has two

primary functions:

1. To settle payments with Issuers by transferring to the Issuers the amount spent by

users in the stated fiat currency from its fiat currency reserves.

2. To sell excess cryptocurrencies accumulated to other partner exchanges

The FXT Token Utility

(4 4 We want our FuzeX card holders to be able to use their
cryptocurrency anytime, anywhere. y) D)

Cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, share all the characteristics of ‘money’, except for
one; ‘usability’. For all their benefits, cryptocurrencies are notoriously difficult to spend in the
‘real world’. Our aim is to make cryptocurrencies as useful and as usable in everyday life as con-
ventional fiat currency is now. We want to encourage wider adoption and create a safe, secure

ecosystem that benefits merchants, partners and users alike.

Short Term Utility

In order to get the FuzeX Card delivered as early as possible, we will partner with existing issuers
and partner exchanges for the short term. For the short term, the utility of our FXT Token is
limited in its use cases, therefore it will initially be used as a membership token. Using our FXT

Tokens, token holders will be able to do the following:

FuzeX Card
Purchasing

©

Annual
Membership & rare Limit
Fees
SD FXT Tokens ak

1. FuzeX Card Purchasing: FXT Token holders will be able to purchase FuzeX Cards by using their
FXT Tokens

2. Annual Membership Fees: Initially when we partner with issuers, there will be an ongoing BIN
(Bank Identification Number) sharing cost. Therefore, we will have a small annual membership
fee for FuzeX Card users. This annual fee can be lowered and paid by using FXT Tokens. There-

fore, FXT Token holders will pay cheaper annual fees than non FXT token holders.

3. Transaction Limits: There will be a reasonable limit set per transaction for FuzeX Card
users, and this limit can be increased based on the amount of FXT Tokens held by the user.
This limit will be imposed by the Issuers, due to the risk of the exchange rate from crypto-

currency to fiat.
This is the short term utility of our FXT Tokens until we create and build out our full Fuzex
Ecosystem . A key part of our project and payment platform is developing our own FuzeX Exchange,
but this will take time. Having our own exchange is essential to adopting other cryptocurrencies for

use with the FuzeX Card, and maximising and expanding the utility of the FXT Token for our token
holders.
Long Term Utility

Once we build our FuzeX ecosystem, by integrating our partners, who are co-branding and working
with us (to use their tokens with our FuzeX Card to make payments], our payment platform will

then evolve to become a service platform.

Our FXT Tokens will then take on a more important role within our service platform ecosystem,
as a medium between tokens and a bridge between services offered by these tokens. Once these
tokens are listed on our FuzeX Exchange, we can convert FXT Tokens to our partner tokens. This
means that all FXT Token holders will be able to use and access partner services with their FXT

Tokens.

For example, partners in our FuzeX Exchange who provide tokenised services such as; travel,
accommodation, medical, legal, coupons etc. can have their tokens exchanged by us, using FXT

Tokens.

Partner Advantages

From a partner perspective as we purchase their tokens the actual utility model of their tokens

does not change, and the benefits are as follows:

1. Firstly, we provide payment capabilities for their tokens through our FuzeX Card and FuzeX
Exchange.

2. Secondly, partners can access and offer their tokenised services to a huge pool of FuzeX
Card holders, FuzeX Exchange users and FXT Token holders.

3. Thirdly, we will provide a strategic price for their cobranded FuzexX Card if they are inside

our ecosystem.

FXT Token Holder Advantages

From a FXT Token holder perspective, they can access a variety of services through our FuzeX
Ecosystem using their FXT Tokens. This will save time and also fees, as our FXT Tokens can be

exchanged fee-free inside our FuzeX Exchange for other partner tokenised services.

Moreover, by using our service platform, users can benefit from a more competitive pricing

structure and deals specifically targeted to FXT Token holders.

As our FXT Token value increases and more partners join our FuzeX Ecosystem, the benefits of

pricing and deals will also increase too, as the exchange rate of our FXT Token strengthens.

Nectar 2.0

Introduction

The Nectar Token (NEC) was designed
in 2017 and launched at the start of 2018
with the aim of incentivising liquidity on
markets traded on the Ethfinex digital-
asset exchange platform. Ethfinex's
initial vision was to decentralise its
platform along two streams in parallel:
Technology and Governance.

The Nectar Token was the instrument
for incentivising and enabling this
transitional evolution. This document
lays out the launch vision for Nectar
2.0, with a series of fundamental
design improvements enabling Nectar
to successfully deliver its goals.

future direction and actions established for

Ethfinex’s development.
Nectar 2.0

Background

Under the original model, NEC was inflationary,
with new tokens created in proportion to trading
volume and distributed to market makers.

The Nectar (NEC) token was launched in February
2018 with the primary purpose of incentivising
liquidity on the Ethfinex centralised exchange.
Traders who provided liquidity to the order books
were rewarded with NEC tokens when their limit
orders were matched. Tokens were issued in
proportion to each trader's share of total exchange
maker volume. This was not only a novel concept
at the time, paving the way for a host of copycat
exchange tokens, but also acted as an effective
mechanism to distribute the token to those who

had the greatest involvement with the exchange.

Furthermore, 50% of Ethfinex exchange trading
fees were pledged to NEC holders via a set of
smart-contracts on the Ethereum blockchain to
token holders. As of 20th September 2019, there are
17,807 ETH" (~4.0 million USD) pledged to holders.

The original NEC 1.0 model was inflationary, such
hat the amount of NEC issued per USD value of
rading volume on the exchange decreased over
ime. Traders were incentivised to provide liquidity
o the exchange sooner rather than later due to
he declining issuance schedule.

The token was also used to make governance
decisions via a community portal at Nectar.
Community. For example, NEC holders were issued
emporary voting tokens which they were then

able to use to vote new tokens onto the exchange.

There were 14 such voting rounds leading to over
40 new tokens being added to Ethfinex.?
Nectar 2.0

Impetus for Change

Since the launch of the concept for the Nectar
token and the Ethfinex hybrid self-custodial
exchange in the first Ethfinex whitepaper,
published on 2nd August 2017, our technology has
continued to develop.

Since the launch of the concept for the Nectar
token and the Ethfinex hybrid self-custodial
exchange in the first Ethfinex whitepaper’,
published on 2nd August 2017, our technology
has continued to advance and there have been

significant developments in the fields of:

1. Token economics;

2. Decentralised exchanges and other scalable
and/or privacy preserving blockchain-based

applications; and

3. Decentralised (community) governance.

We believe Ethfinex has played a leading role
in all three of these fields, contributing novel
experimentation and many industry firsts, such as:

Trade-mined token distribution to incentivise

market makers;

éhttps.//www.bitfinex.com/ethfinex-whitepaper.pdf

Single-use, tradable, voting rights, dissociated
from the underlying tokens, allowing for
complex voting mechanisms (Ethfinex Voting

Tokens or EVT);

The first exchange to make it possible to access
order books and trade from a hardware wallet
with a counterparty which is using a centralised
exchange, thereby facilitating secure high-
volume trading.

These advances have continued to be developed
through other projects.

However, the original vision for Nectar included
an acknowledgement that the token must evolve
in-line with advancements in these fields, and the
current implementation is now out-of-date.

The previous phase of Nectar’s journey was largely

built around the centralised Ethfinex exchange
Nectar 2.0

platform, with an inflating supply of tokens earned
continuously by those who traded on the platform.
This simulated a mechanism akin to mining in
proof-of-work to facilitate the initial distribution
of Nectar tokens to a large number of traders,
rather than through a sale or other distribution
mechanism, and was subsequently dubbed ‘trade-
mining’ when later adopted by numerous other
exchanges.

However, today, Ethfinex Trustless (now DeversiFi)
has matured as a decentralised trading platform
and has reached a point where its features and
user experience can match those available on fully
centralised platforms. This growth will be taken
one step further with the imminent introduction
of margin trading and several novel features. At
the same time, tools for decentralised community
governance have also significantly advanced. For
instance, projects such as Aragon and DAOstack>
are starting to be used to make and implement
decisions for production systems. Nectar is
therefore able to take the next step along its
journey, moving away from the centralised Ethfinex
platform and redefining itself around Ethfinex
Trustless, with all future decision making being
made by an open and decentralised community.
Consequently, Ethfinex Trustless will rebrand and

evolve to become DeversiFi.

External factors:
The centralised and decentralised exchange
industry is changing fast, and there are now several
competitive models for ‘exchange tokens’ which
have survived the test of time. These exchange
tokens have evolved to not only provide traders
with real utility and valuable benefits, but also to
provide a mechanism for traders to tie themselves
to the long term future of an exchange that goes

beyond simply making and taking liquidity.

The most popular exchange token business
models center around trading fees as a percentage
of trading volume. However, as competitive forces
grow, exchanges are required to compete across
new dimensions and make money from added
value services, such as listings, initial public
offerings and sale of market data. This is similar to

the traditional exchange sector®.

Nectar must react to remain competitive as part

of this changing landscape.

Nectar 2.0

Token Design Goals

There are many important considerations and

modelling involved in token design. Nonetheless,

the following two considerations were at the

forefront when designing the mechanisms and

benefits in the new Nectar 2.0 model.

1) Simplicity

The design of the token must be simple. A
adds

incentives onto whichever systems it interacts

cryptocurrency token new economic
with. Ensuring these new incentives are clear
herefore improves the efficiency of the token at
achieving its goal.

Holders of the token (predominantly traders
in this case) must be able to understand the
model and calculate its value independently. The

oken’'s design may still contain many facets and
utilities but they should be complementary and
standalone, rather than interacting in complex
ways.

(2 ) Incentive Alignment

The primary goal of Nectar is to amplify the
network effects which exist around liquidity on
exchanges by aligning the incentives of traders,
(particularly those who contribute liquidity as
market-makers) with the exchange.

Exchanges in the past were relationship
businesses, with customers choosing to trade at
the marketplace or venue where they had the best
relationships and incentives. Blockchain enables
these incentives and relationships to be codified,
transparently and immutably. This results in
benefits from loyal long-term relationships with

a particular platform such as DeversiFi.

Nectar is the vehicle for representing this loyalty.
Thus, it must incentivise behaviour which brings
liquidity and trading volume to DeversiFi and
must reward long term traders and Nectar token
holders when the platform is successful.
NECTAR

EVOLUTION
Nectar 2.0

Token Supply Reduction
and the Switch from Inflation
to Deflation

The original Ethfinex whitepaper proposed an
innovative method for slowly distributing tokens
every month to ensure that the distribution was
aligned with the largest users of the exchange over
time. This method was implemented in February
2018, with tokens being earned and distributed

ever since.

As a result, over 2000’ accounts are holding Nectar
tokens, either on their centralised Ethfinex wallet or
in their privately owned Ethereum wallets. As users
must be trading to earn tokens, the token holders
are familiar with the industry and are positioned to
be able to guide the next steps for Nectar in a way
which pure speculators would not be.

Challenges

Firslty, a high proportion of tokens are held in
centralised on-exchange wallets. Therefore, the
visibility of the token distribution and the token
holders has been extremely low. This lack of
visibility has inhibited Nectar’s usefulness in the
past for several of our governance experiments
such as token listings.

7As of 19th of September 2019

Secondly, uncertainty is created by a supply which
has been inflating in proportion to uncertain
trading volume. Calculating the token value
is therefore challenging for traders who earn
them or for users who buy and sell them. Market
makers want to know in advance of trading the
transaction cost and be able to factor this into
their trading strategy. The variable ‘rebate’ which
Nectar tokens represented (credited only once
per month) inhibited these strategies in many
cases. The clear takeaway is that simplicity is
essential, and that the Nectar 1.0 model was
overly complex.

Proposal

The switch to Nectar 2.0 will represent a switch
from inflation to deflation, whilst at the same
time destroying 80% of undistributed tokens,
and will involve conducting a ‘staking’ event to

result in a further supply reduction.

Token holders will stake their Nectar tokens (lock
them into a smart-contract on the Ethereum
blockchain) to opt into the changes.
Nectar 2.0

An indirect consequence of this 'staking' event will
be to make the full distribution of Nectar tokens
transparent on-chain. Today, more than 90% of
tokens appear to be held in the top 5 on-chain
addresses, but these addresses actually represents
all of the tokens which are held in hot and cold
storage on behalf of Ethfinex exchange customers.
More details about the implications of this are

provided under the DAO Launch section.

Customers of Ethfinex Centralised exchange
will be able to continue trading via DeversiFi by
transferring their funds to a wallet which only they
control, or alternatively will be able to continue
using their account with centralised custody via
Bitfinex.

Once this migration has been completed, Ethfinex
Centralised will slowly be closed down. Issuance of
Nectar tokens will cease and the supply will then

become fixed or deflationary.

To mark this milestone, Ethfinex will reduce
the supply by destroying 80% of its remaining
undistributed tokens (which represents 400 million

tokens). As a result, Ethfinex will no longer have a

voting majority of tokens going into the community
governance phase. Tokens held in inactive or lost
accounts, or earned but never claimed through
verification on Ethfinex, will never be transitioned
to Nectar 2.0 and as a consequence the supply will
be further reduced”.

Nectar will be traded more widely on both
centralised and decentralised exchanges
because trading will no longer be restricted by
the need for identity verification to Ethfinex.
Nectar 2.0

DeversiFi:
Fee Discounts

The value of Nectar will now be tied to the success of
decentralised exchanges, starting with DeversiFi"

previously known as Ethfinex Trustless).

As a consequence, holding Nectar entitles traders
o fee discounts based on a linear schedule. The

discounts are based on the average balance in

he user's address over the past 30 days, which

incentivises holding and reduces circulating
supply. Tokens locked in the necDAO will also

count towards discounts.

The fee discount is applied on a rolling basis
based on the user’s reference amount of NEC (the
average balance in the user’s address over the past
30 days). If Alice holds 1 NEC she will be eligible for
a 20% fee discount on her first 1OO USD equivalent
of 30-day trading volume every period. If she holds
100,000 NEC she will be eligible for a 20% discount

on her first 10 million USD equivalent of 30-day
trading volume.

This discount structure provides a clear and
easily calculable value for Nectar, in terms of the
discounts that buying and holding Nectar gives to
a particular trader using DeversiFi. For example,
if a trader expects to do 10 million USD of trading
volume every 30 days, buying and holding 100,000
NEC can give them a saving of 4000 USD per 30
days.

Fee discounts are also available to incentivise
placing larger orders and reaching higher 30-day
trading volume thresholds. Each of these three
discounts are applied commutitavely to keep the
calculation simple. e.g. Max discount = 100 x (1 - (1-
0.3) x (1-0.2) x (1-0.2)) %

A substantial decentralised organisation will

token holders, with the purpose of growing and

Nectar

governing the world’s largest decentralised
exchange network, as well as promoting Nectar
token utility. It will launch as one of the most highly
funded DAOs, owning over 17,000 ETH (if every
Nectar token holder opts in), with rights to govern

aspects of DeversiFi as its initial remit.

Governance technologies are a rapidly evolving
stack in the blockchain space. For over 12 months
Ethfinex has been contributing to this area

of research, through significant experiments

using a novel token listing process, Kleros’, for

decentralised evaluations of tokens, a 3-day

Governance Summit'’* and the use of DAOstack'®

for allocation of funds for community bounties.

To leverage the compounding effects of

permissionless innovation in this field, we intend
o build upon and contribute back to the leading
echnologies for community governance. New

thousand person organisations.

Reputation (voting power) in the necDAO will
be distributed via two major mechanisms to
Nectar token holders, with a final small part of
the reputation reserved to be sold (see reputation
scheme section for more information).

At launch, the necDAO will be one of the largest
DAOs in the industry, with a substantial amount
of funding and many participants in the DAO.
The necDAO will also be run by NEC holders who
are likely to be traders first and foremost with
immeasurable experience and knowledge. NEC
holders will be able to make proposals, deploy
capital and grow the DAO as they see fit. The
necDAO will exist independently of DeversiFi, but
given the utility that DeversiFi gives NEC, there
should be a close and synergistic relationship. For
instance, NEC holders may wish to propose and
fund new features for DeversiFi, agree marketing
& events budgets, or propose additional incentives

The necDAO will manage:

the "fee pot" (50% of trading fees collected
so far during the Nectar distribution phase
on Ethfinex, around 17k ETH).

When a nectar holder claims their reputation
in the new DAO, they are asking for their
proportional share of the “fee pot” to be

transferred to the DAO.

The "fee pot" will begin slowly dripping funds
to the DAO via a vesting contract over a 3 year
vesting. This allows vesting to be cancelled
if vulnerabilities are later found, rather than
having the full funds at risk in a complex smart-
contract.

Future funding may come from other sources

which the DAO develops or negotiates.

Nectar 2.0

DAO Launch Process

In order to provide adequate time for NEC holders to orientate

themselves with the intricacies of the necDAO and its processes,
the launch will be split into several sections:

C1) Education and bug bounty 6 weeks

20th September 2019

Begin the education of Nectar token holders
about DAO vision and functionality. Provide
tools and training about the launch process. The
bug bounty runs for 1 month to incentivise the
discovery of vulnerabilities, alongside multiple

security audits.

(2 ) Reputation bootstrap 4 weeks

7th November 2019

During the reputation bootstrap phase, no
governance functions are available, but the DAO
is deployed and Nectar token holders can begin
to earn their Reputation. This ensures that there
will be a wide distribution of Reputation by the

time the first proposals are presented.

21

3 Redeeming phase 2 weeks

7th December 2019

During this phase, Nectar token holders can
claim their Reputation and become familiar with
the tools for making and voting on proposals.
Proposals can be made to the DAO but may

not be voted on or accepted.

4) Governance phase indefinitely

begins to become available allowing proposals

to request them.
Nectar 2.0

The total Reputation available is 1 million
Reputation is not transferable). There will be three
ways of obtaining Reputation. Two of these will
exist only during the initial bootstrap phase, and

he third will be perpetual.

A. Nectar Staking scheme

Perpetual — 850k Reputation available

Each month there is a new staking period, where
users may lock Nectar tokens.

When staking, a user will indicate the number
of periods (N) he is willing to lock his tokens
(maximum of 12 periods). Staking tokens involves
transfering them to a smart-contract.

Every month there is a Reputation auction. For a
period (n), there is an amount of Reputation (Rn)
available, which is defined by:

_ n
Ry = Roa
where a=0.9 and Ro=85 Rep.

The Reputation available in each period is divided
pro rata w.r.t a score. The score for each user is:

S=NT

where N = remaining periods and T = NEC

tokens.

To avoid programmatic math issues, the number
of periods will not continue to infinity, rather, it will
be capped at 100 (~8.3 years), at which point the
new available Reputation will have already become
negligible.

The time that staked tokens are locked for can be
increased at any point by the user. For example, if
a user is already locked for 3 more months, they
may lock from now up to 12 more months, and

update their score accordingly.

B. Nectar Snapshot scheme
(Initial - 100k Reputation available if all claimed)

The scheme will have a predefined block number
(b), which will represent the snapshot of token
holders. There will be a total Nectar tokens (Tp)
at the snapshot. The current Nectar token smart-
contract allows balances at a historic block-

number to be querieck

During the bootstrap period (4 weeks), an agent
that held tb Necar tokens during the snapshot

can claim Reputation. The Reputation received is:

tbh
R= 100k rep
Tb

Reputation will only be redeemable at the end
of the bootstrap period. Reputation not claimed
will be lost. Note that exchanges must claim
reputation on behalf of customers in order to
unfreeze NEC, although it is not transferable.

It is therefore recommended that all holders

withdraw from exchanges in advance.

C. GEN token Auction
(Initial - 50k Reputation available)

There will be 10 auctions lasting 3 days each.

Reputation in the auctions is bought using
DAOstack GEN tokens. The acquired GEN is then
owned by the DAO and used to reward those who
make proposals.

Nectar 2.0

Reputation distribution schemes

Cc. Gen Auction

B. Nectar Snapshot

Note: All Nectar tokens will be frozen at the start
of the transition to NEC 2.0. Once a token holder
participates in the DAO, by staking or claiming
during the redeeming phase, their tokens become
transferrable. Nectar token holders opting not to
participate will be able to destroy their NEC to
claim the proportional share of Ethereum held on
their behalf. After 12 months, tokens which have
not been unfrozen or destroyed will be considered
inactive and cease to exist. Exchanges should be
aware of this in order to un-freeze customer funds.

Governance schemes

There will be 3 schemes available during

governance. Each scheme will have different
parameters, depending on what the aims of the
corresponding proposal. For example, a proposal
to transfer funds outside the DAO requires a higher
level of agreement and requires a longer challenge
period before passing compared to a proposal

which simply signals agreement.

Legal Disclaimer

It is not expected that Ethfinex Inc. or any other
legal entity will provide any new utilities or
roadmap for Nectar after launching 2.0.

Once the DAO has launched, it is responsible for
the future roadmap and development of NEC and
owns all of the infrastructure created, proposed
and launched on its behalf.

All future decisions and new utilities proposed
for Nectar must be decided and implemented
by its DAO. Whilst the DAO may make decisions
regarding Nectar it cannot bind third parties.

So, for example, were the DAO to propose to use
100% of DeversiFi’s revenues to buy back NEC this
could not be done as it would not be a decision
within the DAO’'s competence. However the DAO
may propose an offer to DiversiFi or another
third party to buy, for example, an additional 10%
of future revenues for the DAO. The third party
would be at liberty to reject this offer as with any
commercial transaction.
Nectar 2.0

DeversIFI

A new company will continue to operate,
build, develop, and improve DeversiFi
(previously Ethfinex Trustless) and may
add new features to it.

Nectar 2.0

A new company will continue to operate, build,

develop, and improve DeversiFi (previously
Ethfinex Trustless). It will have no obligations to
Nectar holders or the necDAO beyond providing
the stated fee discounts and using a specified part
of revenues to buy and burn Nectar as outlined
above. However, it may choose to make new

features that might benefit the necDAO.

Over the next 24 months of operations, the new
company will focus on achieving the following

goals and milestones:

Reaching 10 million USD trading volume per
day.

Scaling to achieve average throughput of > 1
transaction per second using Zero Knowledge
proofs for batch settlement.

Adding margin and funding capabilities via
integrations with other DeFi systems, such as
trading of leveraged tokens.

Growing its cross-chain offering to allow the
trading of tokens and currencies which are not
native to the Ethereum blockchain.

Conclusion

This paper has detailed the evolution of the Nectar
(NEC) token since its inception in February 2018,
the impetus for change and the move to the new

NEC 2.0 model.

DeversiFi will be adding new utility to NEC, for
instance in the form of large fee discounts and
pledging an escalating share of exchange trading
revenues to buy & burn circulating NEC tokens. NEC
2.0 will move to a deflationary model, instead of
the previous inflationary model, and DeversiFi will
also burn 80% of its own NEC tokens ($24m USD at
current prices) in order to reduce the total supply.
The 17807 ETH which was pledged to NEC holders
from Ethfinex exchange fees will be deployed into
a new necDAO, controlled exclusively by the 2000+
strong NEC token holder community, in one of the

world’s largest DAOs.

The above detailed changes have been carefully
put together in consultation with NEC holders and
represent a comprehensive overhaul of the NEC
token economics. These changes mark the start
of an exciting new chapter for NEC, NEC token

holders and DeversiFl.

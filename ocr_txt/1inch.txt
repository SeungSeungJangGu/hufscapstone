Abstract

This paper, presents Mooniswap — an AMM|] that uses the constant-
product invariant, with the extension of virtual balances. Unlike other
AMM designs, Mooniswap’s virtual balances allows to blunt the price
impact of the short-term trading volume slippage. This allows profits that
would otherwise be captured by arbitrageurs to instead be captured by
liquidity providers. This makes Mooniswap significantly more profitable
for liquidity providers than most other AMM designs.

1 Introduction

This document will first describe the current state of AMMs on the market
today. It will then provide a detailed description of Mooniswap and highlight
its key differences from other AMMs.

2 Prior work

The constant-product invariant x -y = const and its generalized version af? -
x5? -...+ 2%" = const were initially proposed by Alan Lu from Gnosis[I] to
create AMMs on Ethereum. Vitalik Buterin also called on[2| developers to
run on-chain DEXe?| using the same formula. Several products were launched
using this fundamental design, some with the proposed formulas, others with

own custom formulas.

2.1. Bancor Network

Bancor launched the first-ever AMM in 2017. Bancor pools initially consisted of
the BNT token and another ERC20-compatible token. By requiring existence
of BNT in every pool, Bancor effectively created a star topology network of
tokens, with BNT at the center. Bancor also utilized custom formulas to create
weighted pools and achieve effectively infinite instant liquidity of BNT and other
”Smart Tokens”:

2.2 Uniswap Protocol

Uniswap’s AMM was launched in November 2018. Uniswap allowed the creation
of pools consisting of ETH and any ERC20-compatible token using the constant-
product invariant:

x+y =const
where x — balance of ETH
y — balance ERC20 token

By using a simple constant-product invariant and using ETH as the central
asset, Uniswap was able to create lightweight and gas-efficient contracts.
2.3 Balancer Protocol

Balancer was launched in May 2020. It utilized a generalized constant-product
invariant to support multiple tokens with arbitrary weights in a single pool:

n
Il b?* = const
i=0

where b; — balance of i-th asset
w; — weight of i-th asset
While Uniswap naturally serves as a DEX, Balancer Protocol uses the gener-
alized constant-product invariant to offer an automatically rebalancing portfo-
lio. Both Uniswap and Balancer fundamentally use the same constant-product
invariant.

2.4 Curve Protocol

Curve Protocol was launched in January 2020. Curve found its initial success
as an AMM for mean-reverting assets (such as stable tokens) by introducing its
own formula suitable for mean-reverting assets. Curve combines the constant-
sum invariant « + y = const with the constant-product invariant «x -y = const,
based on the pool imbalance ratio x:

n D\"
xD 7b; + [Tb = xD" + (2)

where b; — balance of i-th asset

3 How It Works

x — imbalance coefficient

D —sum of all asset balances before the swap

All existing AMMs use swap fees to earn profits for their liquidity providers.
(The swap fees are configurable in Balancer for each pool, whereas Uniswap
charges 0.3% and Curve currently charges 0.04% per swap.) Liquidity providers
are ultimately compensated via these fees. But if the pricing function signifi-
cantly misprices the assets in the pool, as might happen after a sudden exoge-
nous price crash, liquidity providers lose potential profit to arbitrageurs who
purchase the mispriced assets.

An AMM can thus maximize its profit in one of two ways: maximizing

trading fees, or minimizing arbi

3.1 Mathematical Model

In Mooniswap, when a swap takes place, the pool does not immediately offer a
profitable trade in the opposite direction. Instead, it slowly improves the price
over some period of time. The following chart shows how several trades would
significantly increase the constant-product invariant from point X to point Q.

where A — Initial balances,

X — Balances after a swap with significant slippage,

B — Virtual balances for the opposite swap after some period of time,
oA, 00 — Line representing the true exogenous price,
BC ; DE ; ZO — Arbitrage trades based on virtual balances,
xy ; YZ, ZO — Parallel translation of arbitrage trades to real balances,
Chart 1. Swap with a huge slippage and 3 subsequent arbitrage trades

After the above swap takes place, the virtual balance for the opposite swap
will linearly move from point A to point X. At some point before this full
transition takes place, arbitrageurs will attempt to exploit the smaller temporary
arbitrage opportunities along the way. For example, when the virtual balance
reaches point B, an arbitrageur may choose to arbitrage the price back to the
true price at point C. Note that points A and C (and the origin) are located
on the same line, which means they have the same price. The chart depicts
three sequential arbitrage trades (BC, DE, ZQ) until the real balance reaches
an equilibrium price at point Q.
Deposits and withdrawals scale virtual balances in the same proportion as
real balances do. The effect of a +100% deposit is shown in the following chart.

where A — Initial real balances,

B — Real balances after deposit,
X, M — Initial virtual balances,
Y, N — Virtual balances after deposit.

Note that the following equality describes the proportionality between real
and virtual balances immediately after deposit or withdrawal:

3.2 Backtesting

To estimate potential earnings of Mooniswap model we analysed slippage of
several Uniswap V2 markets. Results of the analysis are shown in the chart
below. For demonstration purposes we took some of the most liquid stablecoin
markets on Uniswap V2.

Chart 3. Comparison of potential LP income between Mooniswap and
Uniswap V2 on different pools

On average on liquid markets we expect Mooniswap to generate from 50% to
200% more income for liquidity providers than Uniswap V2 due to redirection
of price slippage profits.

3.3. Fees

Mooniswap initially utilizes 0.3% swap fee which can be lowered all the way
down to 0% in the future as a way to provide more competitive prices to the
market.

Mooniswap introduces referral fee to incentivize integrations with wallets,
dapps and other services that increase trading volume and provide additional
income for liquidity providers. Referral fee does not introduce additional pres-
sure on the exchange rate and rewards external actors who contribute to the
protocol by providing external trading volume. Referral fee is only charged
when referral wallet is specified in transaction arguments.

Referral fee is fixed and is equal to 5% of income earned by liquidity providers
on the trade. So initial 0.3% swap fee will be split into 0.015% going to referral
and 0.285% going to liquidity providers. Additional profits acquired due to
using virtual balances are also split in the same ratio with 5% going to referral.

Apart from swap fee and referral fee, Mooniswap does not charge any other
protocol fees.
3.4 Native ETH support

Mooniswap introduces abstraction layer on top of native ETH asset and ERC20
standard to allow direct usage of native ETH. This abstraction avoids wrapping
and unwraping WETH token therefore significantly lowering gas usage on pools
with native ETH.

3.5 Price Oracle

Mooniswap also introduces on-chain volume-weighted average price oracles. Price
oracle data is stored as a cumulative sum of all trade inputs and outputs in
both directions and it is updated after every transaction. By choosing different
periods oracle users can configure the required level of price recency and ma-
nipulation resistance. We believe that due to Mooniswap’s utilization of virtual
balances VWAP oracles will be hard to manipulate by malicious actors.

a AltMarket: the XTO Roadmap

Defining the future
of the business of

music

Humble beginnings.

When the idea for Tao Blockchain
(symbol: XTO) was born in late
2014, our goals were aggressive
but simple: develop a rights man-
agement solution suitable for dai-
ly use by both professionals and
amateurs. In early 2016, the Tao
Network project was born when
we formed our initial partnership

with Boogie Shack Music Group.

This vital relationship allowed us
to take a vested financial interest
in the operations of a profitable
business within the music indus-
try, while at the same time gaining
direct access to the day-to-day op-
eration of the music supply chain.
In August 2016, we launched the
Tao Network (symbol: XTO) crowd
sale and raised $100,000. This
crowd sale marked the culmina-
tion of three years of effort within
both the music and blockchain
verticals. The first quarter of 2017

ushered in a new wave of enthusi-

asm for our project, and we formed
a strong business relationship with
DigiRAMP.com, a working rights
management platform serving the
music and entertainment indus-
tries.

Once we'd assembled all of the
components required to imple-
ment a successful new platform,
we came to a shocking realization:
rights management applications
had no place within the music
industry without proper mon-
etary incentive. Some blockchain
rojects have since attempted

to address this issue by creating
complex profit sharing schemes,

however all blockchain projects

have the same friction for adop-
tion, regardless of the blockchain
used. This friction compounds

a problem which already exists

for rights management platforms

already several rights management

platforms that perform the exact

same service that blockchain applications provide, however they are by and large not profitable. Adding a token-based eco-
nomic scheme simply doesn’t solve the basic supply-and demand-problem that rights management faces, itself.
The problem, at first, seemed unsolvable until one afternoon the CEO of Boogie Shack, Hakim Draper, and the founder of Tao

Network, Bryce Weiner, were having a conversation about the XTO. The solution suddenly became self-evident.

Learning the Music

Business

Assume nothing.

Our relationship with BSMG gave
the Tao project unprecedented
access and mentoring into the
functioning of the business of
music. We were able to partici-
pate directly in artist development
known as “artist and repertoire”
or “A&R,” for short. This is an old
practice of curating and devel-
oping an artist or performer to
develop their unique style into a
profitable brand. This brand then
becomes the long term residual
income that truly provides for an
artist’s lifetime financial suc-
cess. The cryptocurrency space
is all too familiar with profitable
hype cycles, and an artist experi-

ences similar cycles throughout

their career. The execution of a

long-term branding and marketing

strategy smooths out the “boom
and bust”/“feast or famine” cycle
of producing art and allows cre-
ators to make a living doing what
they love.

Traditionally this additional in-
come is from live performances,
tours, featured appearances, syn-

chronization licensing (TV, movies,

video games, etc), and merchan-
dising. Merchandising is an enor-
mous category which ranges from
clothing, to posters and artwork,
to specific brands of alcohol or,

in more recent years, marijuana
products. Within the merchandis-
ing royalty stream a great deal of
flexibility may be expressed as to

how revenue is generated, and one

need only search their favorite
artist on eBay to discover a vast
market of commemorative collect-

ibles.

Blockchain Has It Wrong
Blockchain technology is the
answer to the problems of the
music industry, but perhaps not
as is commonly described. Every
single blockchain-based platform
for the music industry is either a
copy of a model that isn’t prof-
itable, competes with a wildly
profitable incumbent, or is only

profitable for early stage investors

in the off chance the platform is
ever developed and achieves use
at scale. Furthermore, accord-

ing to IFPI’s 2016 report, those

those aged 13-18 account for over
30% of global music revenues.
Minors are an age category that
blockchain-based platforms almost
universally exclude by not respect-
ing who actually buys music and how
those individuals would gain access

to the network’s services.

Rights management and all
other proposed schemes using
blockchain technology are in-
tended to slant the flow of ex-
isting funds from the current
parties to a new scheme, but
none are actually creating any
new value for the music supply
chain. A cost benefit analysis
of any given blockchain solu-
tion incurs a resounding net
negative when viewed within
the perspective of how and
why money is actually made in
the music industry.
Version 0.3

Putting It in Perspective

Quite simply, moving money is the only thing a block-

chain has ever done successfully at any scale.

Accepting that simple fact, one may then observe the
blockchain space and how it has evolved since 2010.
We have seen an exponential increase in blockchains
and tokens to the degree of thousands now in exis-
tence, with hundreds more being created monthly.
The market has not only supported this explosion,

but created specific infrastructure and regulatory
compliance practices in order to cater to it. This goes
beyond the exchanges, but extends to the evolution of
technical analysis, price discovery, and social media

promotions which have evolved to a very nuanced set

of profitable behaviors.

With the coming of regulatory oversight, the current
market of Initial Coin Offerings has already begun to
demand lower risk, regulatory compliant products and
platforms which reduce the friction to on board new
participants. Any solution for music not only requires
all of the above, but must then struggle to “rise above
the noise” of the cryptocurrency space, itself. What
begins as a noble and well-intentioned desire to cre-
ate a service for creators quickly devolves into a pro-
tracted up-hill war of attrition, on not the front line of

one industry but two.

Everyone’s
Solution

The solution for the music industry is the solution

for the cryptocurrency space. A simple, intuitive,

fully regulatory compliant interface required for any
blockchain project also serves as a simple, intuitive,
fully regulatory compliant on-ramp into the crypto-
currency economy.

The opportunity to serve both industries at once
suddenly reveals itself. Exploring that relationship
further based on what we already know about both
industries, and our first music industry-accepted
blockchain application was born.

The solution is simple: a fully regulated cryptocurren-
cy exchange which is able to issue officially licensed
and branded products for sale to the public as peer-
to-peer tradable collectible tokens. Once the market
is created, it may then present Initial Artist Offerings
(IAQ), a new form of token sale which is within 100%
compliance with existing SEC regulations and guide-
lines.

IAO tokens are the 21st century’s answer to the base-
ball card or commemorative coin. The blockchain
record creates a historical chain of events which we
call “Proof of Fan.” The incentives an artist may offer
to their fans becomes an ala carte menu of fan inter-
action, from free shows to face-to-face meetings to
more traditional items like t-shirts and posters, which
is limited only to the creativity of the artist. Not only
the quantity of tokens possessed may be considered,
but also the length of time one has owned a token.
The entire history of support and interaction of a

fan with their favorite artist may now be monetized,
creating entirely new value both monetary and in the

experience.

Constructing an
Economy

Market design for IAOs will bear many of the same traits as traditional Initial Coin
Offerings and cryptocurrency launches, with certain exceptions. Most notably is
that every token offering is officially licensed, reducing the amount of due diligence
required for risk assessment to zero. Every single offering within this ecosystem is
100% fraud free. The manner of analysis of IAOs is reduced to two primary catego-
ries: economic variables and price discovery. All offerings will accept USD, BTC, ETC,
and XTO. Participation in offerings using XTO will receive an automatic 5% discount.

Price Discovery as Artist
Business Analysis

In traditional financial markets, price discovery is a function of basic supply and demand factors related to the
market. The IAO structure offers several metrics from the music industry which are used to create composite
scores known as the Fame Demand and Fame Potential. These two metrics allow for a snapshot view into the art-
ist’s ability to monetize their fan base through traditional methods thereby providing some context for the appeal

of the collectible token representing that artist.

Presence

Presence is determined as a function of social media followers, weighted against the
specific platform due to the variance in performance of each network tracked. Social
media platforms to be tracked include: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, Spotify,

Pandora, Deezer, SoundCloud, and YouTube.

Notoriety

Notoriety is a simple moving average of the number of times per week that the artist is
mentioned in the media. This metric is curated by the AltMarket™ team from a variety

of sources, and each which contributes to the computation will be accounted.

Version 0.3 AltMarket: the XTO Roadmap om”

Where attention goes, money flows.
Discover what Is capturing attention.

Fame Demand is a weighted average composed of three computed scores. The application of weighted aver-
ages allows for the quantification of an artist’s career in comparison to their peers through the same metrics

used by the music industry, itself, albeit in a slightly different format.

Performance

This metric is variable based on the medium of the artist, however it is a weighted aver-
age of the number of public performances and the attendance of each performance.

This metric includes syndication when such data is available.

Potential

Once the AltMarket™ platform is online, the Potential metric will provide a simple mov-
ing average of the changes in an artist’s Demand in various time scales. Potential then
serves as an indicator which may show an artist breaking out before the markets reflect

the change.

The Tao Network is also crime-free, allowing it to be suitable for use for minors who traditionally do not have

access to banking services. Special mobile wallets and promotions are under development which will allow
those under 18 years of age to participate the cryptoeconomy while at the same time supporting their favorite
artists. This unique economic design provides a safe lane for involvement in the cryptocurrency experience
for some of society’s most vulnerable consumers. Even without trading, the 4% annual returns for participa-
tion in network consensus (Proof of Stake) provides additional means of participation for minors in learning

how cryptocurrencies and general economics operate.

After the crowd sale, our primary

focus was demonstrating our

technical abilities in implementing

music industry solutions utilizing
blockchain technology.

Unknown to most of the industry, our
team secretly “leaked” our unpub-
lished technical white paper in January
of 2016 which outlined our engineering
design. In November of 2016 we filed a
provisional patent which was granted
for the administration of rights man-
agement utilizing blockchain tech-
nology. While the industry pursued,
various solutions based on our design,

we began introducing record execu-

tives, music technology CEOs, sound
and recording engineers, and artists

to cryptocurrencies. We seeded the in-
dustry wi O at no charge, in order
to allow individuals direct experience
with the technology and its financial
application. By October of 2017, a
non-trivial portion of the music supply
chain is holding a vested interest in
XTO. We have taught dozens of music
industry professionals how to install
and use Bitcoin wallets. We have,
quite literally, increased cryptocurren-
cy adoption within the music industry
in order to prepare the market for our

applications and products.

XTO Markets

While US dollar and Bitcoin trading pairs will be offered, they will be AML/KYC restricted. As such, AltMarket™ will
enable trading of Artist Tokens against a XTO trading pair. This provides direct access for minors, while at the same
time providing significant arbitrage opportunities. This provides the added benefit of allowing XTO early adopters
a significant advantage in which artists gain the most market support. By design, this allows for XTO holders to

literally become the next generation of music executives.

Making It a Reality

While the requirements are simple, execution is no small endeavor. Steps 1 & 2 were cleverly combined through
the efforts of Hakim Draper. Each legal agreement was celebrated by “making it rain” on everyone in the room and
awarding them between 5,000-25,000XTO tokens without reason or ceremony. This demonstration allowed those
decision makers the opportunity to directly experience the powerful network effects of cryptocurrency first hand,

and without creating a conflict of interest.

This paved the way for the third step, which involved the appraisal of music industry executives of the current

state of cryptocurrency infrastructure. Suffice it to note that the quality and standards were found woefully lack-

ing. Furthermore, of all existing platforms evaluated, none met the due diligence of intellectual property attor-

neys. Drawing from that feedback, the design of AltMarket™ caters towards a unique experience in the crypto-
rency space focusing on customer service and regulatory compliance. Our strict implementation of AML/KYC

allows for the participation of 13-18 year olds in special markets, with funds “unlocking” upon their 18th birthday.

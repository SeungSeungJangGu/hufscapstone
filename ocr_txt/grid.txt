1 Abstract

In the past ten years, the cost of distributed energy resources (DERs), such as solar panels and
wind turbines has decreased significantly. This has led to expeditious and widespread adoption.
Additionally, battery prices are rapidly decreasing, making them economically viable to
supplement variable-generation renewable-resources by storing energy for the electrical grid.
The confluence of these developments has created an emergent electrical grid, where the
means of production are less centralized, and the control systems are less likely to be strictly
top-down. The concept of independently owned and controlled DERs is known as the

transactive energy grid.

The transactive grid promises to increase durability of the electrical grid, while simultaneously
increasing efficiency, and enabling the adoption of more renewable energy. However, the
distributed nature of the transactive grid, poses two major challenges, primarily related to
technical control and grid administration. Both challenges can potentially be addressed using a
blockchain. The ConsenSys energy team has several years of experience building and
demonstrating proof-of-concept blockchain-based distributed energy resource management
solutions. Through this experience, ConsenSys identified the opportunity to form Grid+, which
will build natively Ethereum-based utilities in deregulated markets. Grid+ will demonstrate
production ready blockchain-based energy solutions at scale in competitive commercial
environments in order to enable the transactive grid of the future and prove the advantages of

Ethereum over incumbent technologies.

Grid+ is developing a hardware and software stack to create a secure Ethereum-enabled
gateway and connect Internet-of-Things (loT) devices. The hardware gateway, or “smart energy
agent”, is an Internet-enabled, always-on appliance which will securely store cryptocurrencies
and process payments for electricity in real-time, which we refer to in this Whitepaper as “The
Smart Agent”. The Smart Agent will also be able to programmatically buy and sell electricity on
behalf of the user and intelligently manage smart loads (e.g. Tesla Powerwall or Nest
thermostat). The software stack will work in conjunction with the Smart Agent to make
payments, using a combination of Grid+ designed payment-channels and a Raiden network hub
(when available). Grid+ is developing a system architecture that allows a typical user to
leverage the advantages of cryptocurrencies while remaining unaware of their use. Interestingly,
the implementation of a secure, always-on system, with low friction payment rails, provides a

missing piece of critical infrastructure in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. The Grid+

infrastructure has many uses beyond electricity and will be key to enabling the widespread

adoption of cryptocurrencies.

2 Introduction

2.1 The Energy Supply Chain

Before the Grid+ system is explained in great detail, a brief introduction of the current electrical
grid, its stakeholders, and the challenges facing them will be presented. If the reader is

intimately familiar with the electrical grid, they may skip this section.

Presently, the services needed to provide electricity to the consumer can roughly be divided into

four categories: generation, transmission, distribution, and retail.

2.1.1 Generation

Generation is electricity production by large-scale energy producers. Historically these

producers have been hydrocarbon (or nuclear) based power plants.' In recent years large wind

‘International Energy Outlook 201: Chapter 5- Electricity.” U.S. Energy Information Administration.
https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/pdf/electricity.pdf
Grid+ Whitepaper v2.0

and solar farms have come online.” In order for these alternative-energy entities to be

considered a “generator” they must have generation capacity greater than 1MW.°

2.1.2 Transmission

Transmission is the business of moving electricity over long distances, usually from power
plants (generators) to consumer networks (distributors).* For example, in Texas there are a
series of power lines that span over 500 miles, operate at high-voltage (~300 kV), and transport

wind power from West Texas all the way to Houston.

2.1.3 Distribution

Distribution is the movement of electricity from the transmission (high voltage) network to the
consumer. Distributors operate lower-voltage electrical lines that connect to individual consumer
households or businesses.° In the event of a power outage, consumers call their distributor to
take care of the problem (e.g. re-wiring a fallen tower). For example, AEP® is the distributor in

central Texas.

2.1.4 Retail

Retail is the sale of electricity to the consumers. Retailers are responsible for administering and
billing consumers. Depending on your region, retailers may be known by different names (e.g.
Retail Electricity Provider, or REP, in Texas). In deregulated markets, you might refer to the

retailer as your “utility”. Examples include Green Mountain Energy and Reliant Energy.

2.2 Regulated and Deregulated Markets

Electricity markets in the United States can be divided into two distinct groups: regulated and

deregulated. Figure 2 shows which states fall into each category.

In regulated markets, the four entities in the energy supply chain can operate as a single,
vertically integrated monopoly.° In deregulated markets, governments mandate market
segmentation such that each role in the supply chain must be operated by a separate entity.'°
Deregulated markets offer substantially more competition and are more akin to a free market
because each company must sell their services in a competitive marketplace, which is typically
run by a government-franchised non-profit Independent System Operator (ISO). In addition to

running these competitive markets, ISOs are also tasked with maintaining grid stability and

reliability via market signaling." This latter job is performed via a computer control system,
which the electricity industry refers to as a Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA)

system.”

The SCADA system is used by the ISO to create signals for real-time energy as well as services
markets such as ramping control, frequency regulation, or voltage support. The market signals
are provided to market participants, who then bid into the market and provide the services

needed to keep the grid running at the right voltage and frequency.

In deregulated markets, electricity retailers buy electricity at wholesale prices (in 1MWh energy
increments) and then sell that electricity directly to consumers. Retailers are not responsible for
powering customers directly, but are responsible for metering and billing. In addition to paying
for generation, transmission, and distribution, consumers also pay fees to their retailer. These
costs are largely comprised of marketing, administration, and managing risk/compliance for bad
debts and customer funds. This can (and often does) add up to quite a large percentage, as

shown by the average price of electricity in various states in Figure 3."°

Figure 3: Residential vs. Industrial’® pricing

The difference between the residential and industrial price shown above comes mostly from the
costs passed to the consumer from their retailer. This illustrates the amount by which electricity

prices can be reduced from lowering costs associated with retail operations.

2.3 Existing Retailers

Sometimes referred to as “utilities”, retailers are responsible for billing and interacting with
customers in the last mile of the energy supply chain. An energy retailer buys electricity in the
wholesale markets, pays the distribution system operator a fee for getting the electricity to the
customer, and then bills the customer for the service at a large markup over their cost of goods

sold. Typically only about 50% of the cost of retail electricity is used to pay for the electrical

‘4In this paper, we use “residential” and “customer” pricing interchangeably. Residential customers (e.g.
households) are just one kind of utility customer (as opposed to commercial) and will be the target
demographic of Grid+.

‘Industrial pricing reflects wholesale + distribution costs. Thus, the wholesale rate (the rate we are
targeting) will be lower than these numbers.

energy itself.'° The other half is tied up in administrative burden, marketing, and risk
management associated with bad debts. Retailers are often slow to evolve and rarely welcome

new technology with open arms."”

When a customer signs up for a legacy utility a credit check process begins, which determines
the likelihood that the customer will default on payments. Retailers are credit facilities, as they
provide energy on credit and then bill consumers in arrears, usually on a monthly basis.
Retailers deploy complex risk assessment algorithms’? which take into consideration the
percentage of potentially delinquent customers and then add the expected uncollected value
(plus a buffer) into the rest of their customers’ bills. This means customers who pay on time are
subsidizing delinquent and non-paying customers. This is exacerbated by the fact that states
regulate how long utilities must continue to provide power to their customers even after

delinquent payments (typically 3-15 days’®).

2.4 Challenges of Renewables

The installation of photovoltaic (PV) arrays is hastening the grid’s decentralization and
empowering consumers to become producers (turning them into “prosumers”). Approximately
38% of residential electricity cost pays for transmission infrastructure and losses during
transmission.”° When a customer installs PV modules, however, the generated power need only
travel a few meters from source to load. Moving power from a person’s roof to their refrigerator
is significantly more efficient than sourcing it in from a generator 150 miles away. Household PV
ownership has proven it can offer a much more efficient energy solution that can also pay for
itself over time. Solar adoption has outpaced even the most aggressive estimates from a

decade ago, and it is not expected to slow down anytime soon. (Figure 4)

Although environmentally friendly, PVs introduce new problems for the electrical grid because
the generated power must either be stored or used immediately. Typically, generated energy is
consumed by household load and any remainder is sold back to the grid. This may seem like a
sustainable system, but it poses serious technical challenges when deployed at scale. In some
regions, PV penetration is so high that more energy is pumped back into the grid than the grid
can handle, resulting in a condition called overvoltage.”” The grid must respond by curtailing
production to remove excess energy or risk damaging its infrastructure. Furthermore, solar
generation is intermittent and is affected by local cloud cover and weather conditions. This
intermittency causes rapid drop-offs or increases in produced energy which must be buffered by

other energy producers to maintain grid stability.”°

Colloquially named for the silhouette of a duck, this curve shows two peaks in
hydrocarbon-based power production (blue line) during the morning and night. The problem is
that solar energy is only generated during the day, but the peak load demand is in the evening.
Therefore, power plants must quickly ramp-up generation by 50% or more as sunlight wanes.
This process is inefficient and challenges the capabilities of large power plants. On some days
in California, the solar production mid-day is so high” that CAISO?’ actually pays solar

generators to not produce energy. This process is known as “curtailment”.

If energy storage capabilities had grown at the same rate as PV adoption, the Duck Curve
would not exist. Fortunately, breakthroughs in battery manufacturing are driving down storage

costs (Figure 6).”° The levelized cost of energy storage (LCOS) is now as low as $0.13USD per

2.5 Using Ethereum in Electricity Markets

An often overlooked aspect of public cryptocurrencies is that of user agency.” In short, user
agency is the concept that the user is in charge of her assets at all times, and those assets are
easily exchangeable for other assets. Users of public cryptocurrencies secure their own funds
and authorize their own transactions. Public blockchains enable consumers to make payments

using any “tokenized” asset.

Grid+ provides an accounting layer for the energy ecosystem by utilizing Ethereum smart
contracts. Users retain control of their own assets and can choose exactly how they are utilized
in the system. By moving the transaction logic for both energy and payments onto a trustless

architecture (blockchain + state channels), Grid+ reduces the administrative burden of

processing transactions over legacy rails (traditional payment processors typically charge fees
of 1.5 - 2.5%**). Additionally, by pushing market signals to customers, Grid+ enables customers
to make smarter decisions about their energy usage. This lowers their own costs, while also

increasing the efficiency, robustness, and reliability of the electrical grid as a whole.

In this section, key terms related to the Grid+ technology stack are defined. Readers

knowledgeable about Ethereum and related concepts may skip these definitions.

2.5.1 Ethereum

Ethereum is a readable, writable, and programmable ledger accessible to any individual with an
Internet connection. Thousands of users all over the world run software (each of these users is
running a “node”) that maintain the ledger and these users are financially incentivized by the
system itself to do so. Any user (even ones not running a node) may write a program and
upload it to Ethereum. To do so requires some amount of ether, Ethereum’s underlying

currency, be paid to the owner of the node which appends the program to the ledger.

The program, now uploaded to the Ethereum “blockchain” (a specific kind of ledger), will live on
for as long as at least one person continues to run an Ethereum node. The program cannot be
changed and anyone may interact with it. A program on the ledger is called a “smart contract”, a
term coined in 1994 by Nick Szabo to describe a piece of code capable of executing some
function within a decentralized ledger.** Smart contracts can be trusted by anyone to execute
exactly as-specified in their code, and the code itself is publically visible on the ledger. Once
deployed to Ethereum, these pieces of logic cannot be tampered with, destroyed, or restricted

by any party in any way.

2.5.2 Tokens

In the context of Ethereum, smart contracts colloquially referred to as “tokens” include a
minimum set of functionality defined by a community standard called ERC-20.* This standard
exists to ensure all tokens have the same minimal functionality (e.g. ability to be transferred)

and facilitates token interoperability.

35 Ethereum EIPs, ERC20, https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/20

17
Grid+ Whitepaper v2.0

Tokens can represent anything. For example, Alex could issue Alex Coin, redeemable (only by
Alex) for 1 hour of his labor. Nick Johnson®*, one of Ethereum’s core developers, created
BeerCoin, stating “a person's BeerCoin is only as valuable as the recipient's belief that they're good
for the beer, should it ever be redeemed”.*’ Tokens can also be issued and backed by fiat money
deposits from a trusted organization or government. Such tokens might then be redeemable for the
issued fiat currency (e.g. US dollars) by the issuing institution. Grid+ believes that fiat backed stable
tokens will enable far more commerce to be conducted using Ethereum’s rails in lieu of traditional

payment processors.

2.5.3 Stable Tokens

A problem that has plagued digital currencies since their inception is price volatility.
Cryptocurrencies (e.g. ether, bitcoin) underlying decentralized protocols (Ethereum, Bitcoin) are
not issued by central institutions. Thus, they are not backed by anything but trust that there will
be future demand both for the protocol and its native token. This leads to rampant speculation

which, in immature markets, leads to huge slips in liquidity and large price volatility.

The future of money cannot depend on volatile assets, which is why stable tokens have
remained a popular topic of conversation. Although difficult to implement on the Bitcoin
blockchain, stable tokens are simple to issue on Ethereum since all that is needed is an
institution to back them. If a trusted counterparty has a large reserve of U.S. dollars, it can mint
USD tokens and sell them for $1 on a currency exchange. Those minted tokens can now move
through the Ethereum ecosystem freely until some user chooses to redeem her tokens in

exchange for a bank wire.

2.5.4 Payment Channels

Although tokens can move from user to user (and also from user to smart contract), each one of
these transfers (called “transactions”) require that the global Ethereum ledger be updated. A
transaction requires the requester pay ether to the node making the ledger update. Before
seeing the updated token balances, all users must wait for the next ledger update, which takes

about 15 seconds in Ethereum.

https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4v7opj/introducing_beercoin/

18
Grid+ Whitepaper v2.0

It is not feasible for mainstream users to create a transaction every time they want to buy
something. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen massive network congestion® as a result of
increasing popularity, but much of that traffic can be ameliorated using technology called

payment channels.

As an analogy, imagine you are at a bar and plan to stay there all night. If you open a new tab
and close it out after paying for each round, you must sign multiple receipts and the bar incurs
multiple transaction fees from their payment processor (this is why they always ask if you want
to leave a tab open). If you instead keep your tab open across several rounds, you need only

sign one receipt at the end and you save the bar some amount in transaction fees.

The concept is similar in Ethereum. Instead of creating 1,000 ledger updates, one can open a
payment channel and instead pass 1,000 mathematical proofs that prove the sender can pay
some number of tokens to the receiver. These can be verified outside of Ethereum (“off-chain”)
and only one proof (typically the last one) is needed to close the channel. Thus, one thousand
transactions can be reduced to two: one to open the channel and one to close it.*° Simple
payment channels like the ones Grid+ uses are easy to design today, but more complicated

state channels are an ongoing topic of research and experimentation. (Appendix)

2.5.5 Proof of Stake and Casper

Readers familiar with Ethereum will be well aware of the coming Casper implementation” of
“Proof-of-Stake”. Casper (and more broadly Proof-of-Stake) is a significant upgrade to the
Ethereum protocol expected to be deployed around Q1 2018. At a high level, Casper allows
users who own ether to deposit it to a smart contract and then become permissioned to update
the ledger. If one or more of these bonded validators act out of turn or attempts to update the
ledger in a way which violates state transition rules, those changes will be rejected by the
broader set of stakers and those fraudulent validators will lose their entire ether deposit. If
instead these validators act honestly, they earn some amount of ether commensurate with the

fees in the transactions they have processed.

Note that this process of “validating” transactions in Casper requires that users cryptographically
“sign” data stating that they believe the data is factual and will induce a valid update of the

ledger. This has some security implications which will be discussed later.

Although the transition to Casper will not affect how Grid+ operates (in that it will not change
Ethereum’s usability), this protocol upgrade will be referenced later for other purposes. For more
information, see Vitalik Buterin’s article*’ on proof of stake as well as his other writings on

Casper (in the same blog).

3 Value Propositions

Grid+ can immediately introduce efficiencies to electricity retailing by leveraging the public
Ethereum blockchain. This creates incentives for consumers build their own distributed energy
storage capabilities, which will ultimately make renewable energy production more sustainable
and efficient. There are many advantages to the proposed Grid+ system, which are broadly

grouped into short and long term value propositions.

3.1 Short Term - Energy Retailer

Grid+ will operate as a commercial electricity retailer in deregulated markets. There are
fundamental efficiencies Ethereum offers that will help Grid+ significantly undercut costs of
incumbent utilities. Approximately 50% of a retailer's cost are not associated with the purchase
of wholesale energy and can potentially be removed through better technology and more

efficient processes.

21
Grid+ Whitepaper v2.0

3.1.1 Lower Variable Costs

Billing and settlement remain a largely manual process (think spreadsheets, calls to the bank,
and paper mail) for retailers. All these processes can be automated, and likely will be at some
point, with or without Grid+ (automation is coming for us all*”). Automation will reduce overhead

costs, allowing Grid+ to lower consumer utility bills.

In addition to automation (which itself is an efficiency), Grid+ also introduces the efficiency of
user agency, which means that Grid+ do not need to process transactions itself - the Ethereum
network takes care of that. All payments are recorded automatically and moved from one smart
contract (a payment channel) to another smart contract (the fee vault, which is called
Karabraxos - more on this later), without needing traditional payment processors. Thus, the only
variable cost associated with accounting and payments will be the costs of executing smart

contracts on the network, and these costs are largely mitigated by payment channels.

3.1.2 Eliminating Bad Debts

In addition to foregoing centralized payment processing, user agency also allows Grid+ to
eliminate costs related to risk. Rather than pooling risk as legacy utilities do, Grid+ will require
customers to pay for their electricity in real-time via cryptocurrency stored on their Smart Agent.
As the customer uses electricity their Smart Agent (an automated, always-on appliance) will
make payments, via a payment channel, at each billing cycle in real-time (every 15 minutes or
one hour, depending on the local ISO). In addition to adding currency to their Smart Agent
(either ether or the Grid+ stable coin, BOLT), Grid+ will require customers make a refundable
deposit that can be partially drawn-down if the Smart Agent fails to pay on time. The deposit
serves two purposes. First, it prevents interruptions in service if connectivity is lost. Second, it
provides a buffer if the Smart Agent runs out of funds. Grid+ customers will be notified as their
deposit is consumed, and once it reaches some lower threshold, the customer will be notified of
service termination. Customers will always be able to top-off deposits if their deposits get
partially utilized. Real-time payments coupled with the deposits will prevent the accumulation of

bad debt in any meaningful quantity.

Grid+ Whitepaper v2.0

3.1.3 Lower Marketing Expenses

Grid+ will offer a significantly lower price of electricity compared to incumbent retailers which will
likely lower the cost of customer acquisition over time (~$150 for current retailers**). Grid+
anticipates initially spending more on customer acquisition, than the incumbent retailers, as it
establishes its brand and presence in existing markets. However, Grid+ also anticipates
customer acquisition costs decreasing over time. Since Grid+ is able to offer substantially lower
prices, it will have much lower customer turnover, which can be as high has 30% per year for

traditional retailers in deregulated markets.“

3.2 Long Term - Distributed Storage and Open Markets

Since customers are given nearly frictionless access to the wholesale energy markets, they will
experience market-driven price fluctuations, which will enable their Smart Agents to make
smarter decisions about consumption. As the price of storage (i.e. batteries) drops, there will
eventually come a time when, it is in a rational consumer's economic interest to purchase a

battery to arbitrage energy prices and provide ancillary services to the electric grid.

3.2.1 Enabling Efficient Markets

The computation and allocation of costs associated with using the distribution network introduce
some of the largest inefficiencies in today's electrical grid. Fees are billed in a non-dynamic way,
socializing the cost of the infrastructure over all market participants on a per kWh usage basis.
Presently, pricing does not consider that each customer's kWh represent different real costs due
to variations in geography, network connection topology, and time of use. This socialization of
cost disincentivizes the adoption of DERs leading to economically irrational outcomes. With the
adoption of smart-meter technology at each node in the grid, including the customer endpoints,

the data needed for computing real-time dynamic distribution costs will become available.

3.2.2 Natively Support P2P Markets

Geographically and topologically segmented markets will emerge once dynamic, granular
locational marginal pricing (LMP) is implemented on the distribution grid. Once this occurs there

will be situations where customers will not want to interact with wholesale markets directly, but

rather trade energy locally. At this point customers will be able to utilize Ethereum to facilitate
the exchange of energy directly in a peer-to-peer manner, rather than clearing on a centralized
market. Trading will be limited to customers of Grid+ or other participating retailers until

regulators make accommodations for P2P markets generally.

3.2.3 Integrate ISO Wholesale Markets

The problems that are faced by retail electricity markets, namely inefficient mechanisms for
accounting and settlement, as well as counterparty risk, are also issues in the ISO-operated
wholesale markets. Unlike the retail markets, the wholesale markets include far fewer

participants, but have much larger trade sizes.

Wholesale markets trade what are called “forward contracts”, which is a contract promising to
deliver energy at some future time. Therefore, there are considerable counterparty risks when
interacting in a market where some participants trade forward contracts. This risk has
manifested itself a number of times and has cost market participants and consumers large
amounts of capital with the most recent large failure being the bailout of Constellation Energy.”
NASDAQ has also realized that trading of financial instruments can benefit from blockchain
technology and have developed their own platform, Ling.** In the long term Grid+ anticipates
extending the technology developed for the residential business into the ISO operated
wholesale markets, at which point there would be no distinction between retail and wholesale

markets.

4 Intelligent Agent

Grid+ will be designed in a way that does not require Grid+ customers to have a detailed
understanding of how cryptocurrencies work. Grid+ is building a seamless solution that
leverages the power of the public Ethereum network without requiring users possess a high
degree of technical aptitude. One critical piece of the system that makes this possible is the
Grid+ Smart Agent, an always-on, Internet-enabled device. A render of the planned prototype of

the Smart Agent is shown in Figure 7.

25
Grid+ Whitepaper v2.0

Figure 7: Grid+ Smart Agent Prototype

4.1 Basic Usage

At its core, the Grid+ Smart Agent is a computer that pays for a customer's electricity usage in
real time. After the Smart Agent is registered, the customer purchases U.S. dollar stable tokens
(called BOLT) from Grid+ with a credit card or bank transfer. Once the payment settles, these
BOLT tokens are transferred to the user’s Smart Agent. As long as the Smart Agent holds

BOLT, it may read from the household smart meter and pay for the electricity usage in real-time.
A schematic of this process is shown in Figure 8.

26
Grid+ Whitepaper v2.0

A customer may get started with Grid+ by signing up, purchasing a Smart Agent, registering that
Smart Agent, and buying BOLT on the Grid+ web console. The customer does not need to do
anything else until the Smart Agent runs out of BOLT (note that Grid+ will offer an

automatic-payment option).

4.2 Smart Agent Registration & Key Generation

Before shipping Smart Agents, Grid+ will register the serial number from the device in the Grid+
registry contract.*” Only Grid+ can register devices in this contract, which will ensure that
unsupported devices do not report data and cannot make transactions. After registering the

device, its serial number will be mapped to an Ethereum address generated by Grid+.

Once delivered to the customer, the Smart Agent may be registered with a serial number found
inside the box. This maps the owner’s wallet address to the serial number, which will be
associated with the Smart Agent’s digital identifier. The Smart Agent will be capable of making
digital signatures*® from a secure hardware enclave and may act autonomously while still being

registered with Grid+ and owned by the customer.

There is clearly a problem with the registration workflow, and it may be obvious to some of the
more advanced cryptocurrency users. If the device signs messages with the key Grid+
generated, this defeats the purpose of user agency and makes Grid+ responsible for its

security. Thus, the device will be designed to generate its own key after the user claims it.

The technical details of this process are based on the following two lines of Solidity code (an

Ethereum programming language’’) in the Grid+ registry smart contract:

mapping (bytes32 => address) registry;

mapping (bytes32 => address) owners;

The first line maps a hash of the Smart Agent’s serial number to an address. For each issued
Smart Agent, Grid+ will assign a serial number and generate a setup key on the device. Grid+

then will call a function on the registry contract to whitelist the setup key. After the setup key (on

4” Grid+, Contracts, https://github.com/GridPlus/Contracts/blob/master/Registry.sol

48S pecifically the agent will make ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) signatures using the
secp256k1 curve. These signatures are presently required to participate in Ethereum and the
corresponding cryptographic key pairs serve as the agents’ digital identities.

4°Solidity documentation, https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/

Grid+ Whitepaper v2.0

device) is registered, it will be seeded with a small amount of the native Ethereum

cryptocurrency, ether, and the Smart Agent will be shipped to the user.

Once the user receives and boots the device for the first time, it will automatically generate a

new key-pair and call the registry contract to replace its setup key with the new wallet key-pair.

Only the consumer has access to the newly created private key, thus she now has user agency.

Further, to ensure utmost transparency, Grid+ has open sourced all its client code, which it

welcomes the broader community to thoroughly review.

The second mapping above will be set by the human user claiming a device. The owner must

have a serial number on hand and may only claim a device that was registered by Grid+. To see

how this works in action, please explore the Grid+ demo application.”

Figure 9: Grid+ System Architecture

For additional security, Grid+ will allow the use of a multi-signature (or “multisig”) wallet. For

those unfamiliar with this concept, it is relatively simple. In order to initiate a transaction to move

5°Grid+ Demo Application, https://app.gridplus.io

28
Grid+ Whitepaper v2.0

funds or trigger a contract, the transaction requires ECDSA signatures from more than one
private key. A user can create a 2 of 3 multisig contract account which requires at least 2 of the
3 keys to sign any given transaction. Grid+ plans to use a simple multisig utilizing detached
signatures®' as designed by Dr. Christian Lundkvist. Under Metropolis (Ethereum’s next major

update), multi-signature wallet contracts will be able to transact as normal accounts”.

The multisig scheme will reduce the risk of a hacker gaining access to customer funds if the
Smart Agent is hacked. The benefits of user agency are nullified if an attacker can connect to
your wifi and break into your Smart Agent to move your Smart Agent’s BOLT and ether into
another account. The diagram above shows MS1, MS2, and MS3 - which all represent different
private keys in a multisig setup. This allows a user to utilize a vault setup wherein she can

deposit larger sums.

Practically, this means a user will always be in control of her funds (MS2 + MS3). In a situation
where the Smart Agent is stolen/destroyed, the user still maintains the ability to access her vault
(MS1 + MS2). This setup scheme allows large amounts of value to be stored - outside of the
Smart Agent’s hot wallet. While this setup is recommended, it is not required. Multisig
transactions incur a larger transaction fee (although this may not be true in future versions of
Ethereum®’) and there exists some economic trade-off between security and cost which can be
different for each user. In a scenario where a casual user spends $50 per month on energy, she
may be willing to store that amount of BOLT on her Smart Agent’s hot wallet. When energy bills
are in the hundreds or thousands of dollars, or a user wishes to store six months of electricity
worth of cryptocurrency on the Smart Agent, she may desire the additional level of security

provided by a multisig account.

4.4 Smart Agent Energy Trading

To better understand what decisions a Smart Agent makes on behalf of a user, the reader must

first understand some of the intricacies of the electricity market.

It was previously stated that Independent System Operators (ISOs) manage wholesale markets
wherein producers sell electricity and utilities buy it for resale to their customers. This is a simple

description, but it is also a gross oversimplification of how wholesale electricity markets work.

29
Grid+ Whitepaper v2.0

Wholesale markets have much higher degrees of complexity, largely driven by the fact that load
on the electrical grid must match, nearly exactly, the generation at any given point in time. If
generation significantly deviates from load either a high-voltage or low-voltage situation occurs,
either of which can severely damage equipment attached to the network. ISOs have created
systems that help manage the grid in a stable manner throughout the day, but prefer to use
market mechanisms to coordinate consumers and producers in such a way as to keep the grid
balanced. To ensure this goal, ISOs have created markets in which they incentivize the
coordination of disparate interests. Three of largest markets are day-ahead, real-time, and

demand response.

4.4.1 Day-Ahead and Real-Time Markets

One of the mechanisms that helps to maintain the stability of the grid is the ability to forecast
both demand and production. ISOs operate what are known as day-ahead-markets which
allows both generators and utilities to buy and sell forward contracts on electricity for one day in
the future. These markets typically operate in 1 hour windows, such that from 1pm to 2pm ona
given day, market participants bid on the forwards for 1pm to 2pm the following day. The
forwards market is locked in by 2pm, and the corresponding parties are then contractually
obligated to produce or consume the specified amount of energy the following day from 1pm to
2pm. This gives the generators time to plan their production to match what the market believes
will be the demand one day in advance. The ability to plan ahead helps producers manage their
operations and supply chains in a manner that is significantly more efficient and minimizes
drastic changes in demand on other generators in the network. This also incentivizes
consumers to try and accurately predict their consumption one day ahead because they can
mitigate price volatility in real-time markets since prices in the day-ahead markets are often less

expensive.

The real-time market is exactly as it sounds. It is the market for buying and selling energy in
real-time or near real-time. Depending on the specific market there can actually be one or
multiple markets that fall within the real-time designation; such as 1 hour, 15 minutes, or 5
minutes. The difference between the real-time prices and the day-ahead prices for the Maine

interconnection on June 11th, 2017 are shown below in Figure 10.

How much energy will a user need tomorrow? Should she buy it in the day-ahead markets,
real-time markets, or some combination thereof? These are questions a Smart Agent can
answer. Normally, this decision is made by a utility which is not strongly incentivized to optimize
costs for individual consumers. Instead, they attempt to minimize overall volatility, and socialize
the average cost of energy throughout the day over their customer base. Most utilities will
charge their customers a flat rate regardless of how much electricity their customers use, when
they use it, or how much it actually costs to buy. The flat rate is based on the average wholesale

price plus some non-negligible markup (~30-50%).°°

Although energy storage has many benefits and is an ideal distributed resource to be controlled
by independent Smart Agents in real-time, the fact remains that there does not yet exist a high

degree of energy storage penetration in the market place. This will likely change in the near

future®” as market incentives are updated to accommodate the burden renewables place on the
grid. In the proposed scenario wherein residential customers have access to real-time pricing in
the wholesale market, the incentive for installing energy storage exists. Customers with energy
storage can have their Smart Agent conduct temporal energy arbitrage and generate revenue.
This can be done simply by buying electricity when it is cheap and selling it back or consuming it
when energy is expensive. For example, if electricity is -$0.10/kWh from 6-8am (a price not
inconceivable based on Figure 10) and +$0.25/kWh from 4-6pm, a savvy arbitrageur would be
able to net +$0.35/kWh. For a Tesla Powerwall II°°, this would generate around $3.5 per day or

$1275 dollars per year, allowing the Powerwall to pay for itself within six years. (Appendix)

4.4.2 Demand Response

Although ISOs can control the generation side of the electrical grid through day-ahead and
real-time energy markets, they must employ other methods to incentivize loads and ensure grid
balance. One of these balancing techniques is called demand response. Rather than paying
generators to produce more energy, ISOs can pay consumers who have flexibility in their loads
to shut-down those loads for a short period of time. This creates a new set of opportunities for a

customer’s Smart Agent to react to the economics of the demand response market.

The Nest smart-thermostat®® is an example of what is known as a dispatchable load. A
customer's Smart Agent can monitor the demand response markets and, if configured to do so,
use a Nest to turn off heating or air conditioning for a short period of time in order to earn
revenue. The grid’s market signals for demand response can be broadcast to all nearby Grid+
Smart Agents, which can offer bids stating they will turn off their household air conditioning if a
certain price is paid. If enough bids are made to satisfy the ISO’s resource increment
requirement (usually 100 kWh), then the aggregate bid would be broadcast into the demand
response market by Grid+. The revenue that is generated from the service could then be sent to

participating Smart Agents.

In addition to offering services to demand response signals, a customer's Smart Agent could
also use the Nest to intelligently control the home’s temperature based on the real-time market
prices. For example, if the price of electricity is usually highest at 7pm, the thermostat could cool

the house 2 degrees below the set temperature of the house by say 6:30pm and then allow the

Grid+ Whitepaper v2.0

house to rise 2 degrees above the set temperature by 7:30. This in turn saves the customer
money by avoiding expected consumption of energy at peak prices. Moreover, there are also
situations wherein the real-time price of electricity can spike in excess of 3-5 times the average
electricity cost due to shortfalls in generation and/or congestion in distribution. (Figure 10) If the
agent knew that the home was already within the consumer’s pre-configured comfortable
temperature range, it could choose to forego purchasing energy for 15 minutes in anticipation

that the electricity rate will normalize in the near future.

As more of the user’s devices are connected to the Smart Agent, it will be able to make even
more intelligent consumption decisions. For example, if you own a TESLA, you might normally
come home from work and start charging your car. If your Smart Agent knows that you aren’t
going out tonight, it could defer charging the car until the early hours of the morning when
electricity is significantly less expensive. Both Nest and Tesla provide APIs that can be used to

interface these devices with the Grid+ system.

It is important to highlight the value of smart devices that moderate a customer's electricity
consumption profile. These loT devices on their own hold valuable data, but lack the ability to
transact on a shared financial infrastructure and create an economic benefit for their owner. The
Grid+ smart energy Smart Agent is the central point of both the financial connectivity and

decision making for a customer's collection loT devices.

4.4.3 Intelligent Economically Driven Decisions

The decision-making capabilities of the Smart Agent will be further enhanced as information
sharing between customer and Smart Agent increases. For example, if your smart phone
periodically broadcasts your location to your Smart Agent, the Smart Agent would be able to
figure out when you are leaving the house, and when you are coming back. If you stay late at
work, or decide to go downtown on a date, your Smart Agent would know to delay cooling the
house until you are on your way home. Say you have a conference in Portland, your Smart
Agent could look at your calendar and determine that you will not be home for the next three
days. It could then decide not to purchase as much energy in the day-ahead markets because it

will know that you will not need to run your AC system.

33
Grid+ Whitepaper v2.0

Note: This could result in privacy concerns for some users, however the data that is transmitted
from the Grid+ smartphone app will be encrypted with the Smart Agent’s public key and will only

be readable locally by the customer-controlled Smart Agent.

4.5 Secondary Uses of the Smart Agent

The Grid+ Smart Agent will be integral to the Grid+ system; however, Grid+ imagines other
users in the Ethereum ecosystem will benefit from it as well. The Grid+ Smart Agent is a
standalone computer with natively integrated hardware and software for the Ethereum protocol.
The Smart Agent will maintain its own Ethereum light client, which is designed for
resource-constrained computing environments.® Users will be able to utilize the Smart Agent for
transaction signing in a secure enclave. The security topology of the Grid+ system will enable
secure and robust storage of cryptocurrency, secure signing of prepare and commit transactions

in Proof-of-Stake with Casper, and a secure cryptocurrency API for loT devices.

4.5.1 Storing Cryptocurrency

Ever since the earliest days of Bitcoin, securely storing cryptocurrency has been a primary
concern and a challenge for many users. Although there have been a number of advances
beginning with paper wallets, multi-signature accounts, and hardware wallets, all of these
methods largely depend upon assets being stored offline to maintain security. Offline wallets
create significant friction in signature creation, and multisignature wallets may introduce “social
latency”. Furthermore, physical wallets rely upon the availability of a single device or safe
storage of a single plaintext backup. Fundamentally, both the air gapped nature of incumbent
methodologies as well as the transactional friction introduced make these methods incompatible
with an efficient, frictionless economy of the future. This is most apparent when it comes to

using cryptocurrency in loT applications such as the transactive grid.

Taking this into account, Grid+ proposes a new security architecture that combines all of the
state-of-the-art methods of securing cryptocurrencies into a single system. The multi-signature
system coupled with a secure hardware enclave, secure computing transaction verification,
physical second factor verification, and segregation of key storage, creates a system where
users will be able to reliably and safely store larger amounts of cryptocurrency in a

standard-setting, secure, robust, and high availability (almost always online) way.

4.5.2 Proof-of-Stake Signing

After the implementation of Casper, Ethereum stakers will need to ensure online connectivity
with near-zero downtime, or else risk a negative interest rate on deposits. Thus, many in the
space believe running instances on Azure or AWS, which have nearly 100% uptime, is the most
desirable option. But storing private keys in the cloud will put potentially billions of dollars worth

of ether at risk.

The Grid+ Smart Agent can serve the purpose of a “Casper-in-the-Box” remote signer. A user
may run the Casper protocol in AWS or Azure and pass the raw, unsigned transaction details to
the Grid+ Smart Agent device. The Smart Agent would then locally sign the staking
transactions. This ensures that private keys never leave the protection of a secure enclave,
under the staker’s supervision. Once again - this structure coincides with the Grid+ team’s
strong belief in user agency. Even more interesting is to imagine using an application running on
top of Ethereum to provide the data to help secure the network. One could envision that a staker
might outsource computational jobs to Golem*', or iExec®, and have unsigned transactions with
provable, appropriate data returned to the Smart Agent. The Smart Agent would pay for those
computations in GNT or RLC, then sign and broadcast the transaction details constructed using
purchased computation. All data analysis is done via an Ethereum application and transactional
data is signed on a customer's Smart Agent. Thus, the Grid+ Smart Agent can potentially

secure the Ethereum ecosystem running Casper without ever leaving the Ethereum rails.

4.5.3 Ethereum API for loT

Although the secondary use cases may appear to only be serving a niche use case, over time
Grid+ anticipates the Smart Agent could be game changing to cryptocurrency adoption. The
initial use case of signing processed transactions during the Casper implementation is a small
one. However, in the future the Grid+ Smart Agent can serve as a financial gateway for all loT
devices. If the projections for loT enabled devices are true, these types of agent devices
connected to the Ethereum network could be of profound importance. By 2020 it is estimated
there will be 20 billion connected devices that will need to transact value.®* The Ethereum
network can serve as the transactional layer for a device connected world. However, having all
loT devices sign Ethereum transactions will be inherently insecure, thus using a proxy agent to

sign on behalf of other loT devices is a logical construct. Therefore, Grid+ is developing a

Grid+ Whitepaper v2.0

RESTful API through which other loT devices can connect to the Grid+ Smart Agent and send
or receive payments in a simple, secure, and permissioned way. Grid+ imagines this device will

become standard as loT becomes ubiquitous.

4.6 Integration and Testing

Is this all theoretical, or has Grid+ actually implemented the above designs? The Grid+ team felt
it was necessary to do real world testing prior to announcing this design pattern to the world.
Over the past year, working in conjunction with one of the world’s largest energy companies, the
Grid+ team has deployed code onto a specific 3kWh smart-battery from a European producer.
Grid+ has proven the concept and is now rewriting much of that code in a lower level language
for what will be a large, production deployment. Grid+ is working with some of the most
progressive energy companies in the world, and looks forward to experimenting on larger
batteries (such as the 14kWh Tesla Powerwall). It is important to note that both the Grid+ design
and its ambitions to operate multiple retailers do not rely upon meaningful penetration of
distributed energy storage in any of the markets serviced by Grid+. Storage capabilities opens
up many additional revenue streams for Grid+ customers (including offering ancillary services to
the grid), but Ethereum by itself can still enable lower cost electricity via dis-intermediation and

user agency.

5 Tokens

Grid+ will operate with a two-token model, with each token being ERC-20 compliant.” The
BOLT token will be treated by Grid+ as a stable-coin, redeemable by Grid+ customers for $1
worth of energy from Grid+ and backed by USD deposits. The GRID token will allow Grid+
customers to purchase electricity from Grid+ at wholesale price. In particular, each GRID token
may be redeemed by a Grid+ customer for 500 kWh of electricity from Grid+ at the wholesale
price available to Grid+ in the jurisdiction in which the customer is located at the time such

electricity is actually purchased.

Grid+ Whitepaper v2.0

5.1 The BOLT Token

BOLT will be the currency required to use the Grid+ platform. It will be treated by Grid+ as a
stable currency, with each BOLT redeemable for $1 (USD) worth of energy on the Grid+
platform. BOLTs will only be created when customers deposit fiat (or ether, which will be sold by
Grid+ for USD) to Grid+, and will be destroyed when Grid+ customers redeem BOLT for USD.
These creation and destruction events will be defined according to a technical specification first
proposed by a member of the Grid+ team, Alex Miller. The Grid+ customer may purchase
BOLT tokens from Grid+ directly for her Smart Agent or may purchase them for her own wallet
and move them to her Smart Agent at any time. Before a Smart Agent can pay for energy, it
must open a payment channel with Grid+ by depositing BOLT to an account of smart contract
controlled by Grid+, a process that will occur automatically. Both energy wholesale costs and
fees chargeable by Grid+ to such customer (or in respect of such Smart Agent) will be deducted

from this BOLT deposit when the channel is closed.

Important Note: Subsidiaries or commercial partners of Grid+ operating outside of the United
States may accept payment of non-U.S. currencies in exchange for BOLT. BOLT, however, will
always be denominated in USD and backed by USD or USD equivalents (such as treasury bills)
held in one or more accounts, trusts or escrows by Grid+ and/or its subsidiaries and commercial
partners. Thus, the BOLT issued in exchange for a non-U.S. currency will be based on the
market exchange rate between USD and such non-U.S. currency and will be subject to
adjustment to cover transaction costs and fees incurred in converting the non-U.S. currency to
USD.

5.1.1 BOLT Redemption

Subject to the satisfaction of any then applicable legal requirements, any Grid+ customer who
holds BOLT will be free to exchange them with Grid+ for USD at any time. Subsidiaries and
commercial partners of Grid+ operating outside of the United States may elect to convert the
USD for which a user has redeemed BOLT into the local currency prior to distribution to the
user. While local laws vary, we anticipate that customers will be required to submit
governmental identification and other information sufficient for Grid+ to comply with any

know-your-customer (KYC) requirements to which Grid+ is subject at the time of the requested

®Ethereum EIP621, https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/621
38
Grid+ Whitepaper v2.0

redemption. KYC verification will initially occur when the customer signs up for Grid+ service,
and will be a condition to utilizing the Grid+ platform and buying or redeeming BOLT. In the
event of redemption, the redeemed BOLTs will be taken out of supply forever via a mechanism

modeled after EIP 661 and, accordingly, the BOLT token supply will be decreased.

Redemptions of BOLT for fiat currency may be subject to certain minimum redemption
thresholds and to deduction to cover the transaction costs that Grid+ will incur in distributing fiat
currency to the redeeming customer (such as wire fees for wired amounts, postage fees for
amounts paid by check and, in the case of non-U.S. jurisdictions, currency conversion fees, if
applicable). Redemption of BOLT will also be subject to various terms and conditions to be set

forth in the Customer Agreements.

5.1.2 The Fee Vault: Karabraxos

Grid+ will not collect fees directly; rather they will be routed from each closed payment channel
to a smart contract known as Karabraxos, which will be found at karabraxos.eth. (Figure
11) The main purpose of Karabraxos will be for Grid+ to exhibit transparency about the number
of BOLT it is earning and for the public to have some idea of how much liquidity will be available

for usage in Raiden when available.

Note that Karabraxos will hold BOLT collected both from retail electricity customers and from

fees generated by the Grid+ Raiden hub.

5.3 The GRID Token

A fixed number of GRID tokens (300,000,000) will be minted before the upcoming token sale -
this will be the only time GRID are created. 90,000,000 GRID will be sold in the token sale.
Each GRID token will be a credit on the Grid+ platform, redeemable by customers of the Grid+
platform for the right to purchase 500 kWh of electricity at the wholesale price available to Grid+
in the relevant jurisdiction at the time such electricity is received by the redeeming customer. At
the time of redemption, GRID tokens will be assigned a timestamp by the redemption contract
and taken out of supply forever via a mechanism modeled after EIP 661.°”

5.3.1 Applying Wholesale kWh

Once GRID have been redeemed and an event emitted, the Grid+ hub reads that event and

references it when billing the Smart Agent in the future. A typical bill® includes the following:

®” https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/661
® Note that there are other pieces of billing data irrelevant to this discussion.

40
Grid+ Whitepaper v2.0

price: 0.1, // units of $/kWh
wholesale price: 0.08 // units of $/kWh
amount: 1, // units of kWh

In this simple billing example, the customer used 1 kWh of power and the markup is $0.02/kWh
(price - wholesale price). If the customer’s Smart Agent has recently redeemed GRID,
the customer’s Smart Agent pays $0.08/kWh, with no additional markup. If a customer has no
amount of redeemed GRID associated with the Smart Agent, the customer pays the normal
Grid+ price of $0.10/kWh.

This would carry over to subsequent bills until the redemption amount is exhausted. For
example, suppose a customer has redeemed 0.05 GRID and been credited with the right to
receive 10 kWh at wholesale price. If the above bill was issued to the Smart Agent, it would pay
$0.08/kWh and the wholesale credits would be reduced from 10 kWh to 9 kWh (because this bill
used 1 kWh). This credit (now 9 kWh) would decrease with each subsequent bill until it hit 0
kWh, at which point the Smart Agent would return to paying the normal Grid+ price (wholesale +

markup).

5.3.2 GRID redemption limits

Each GRID token is redeemable on the Grid+ platform for 500 kWh at wholesale electricity price
(i.e. without Grid+ markup). However, Grid+ will only allow a certain total number of redeemed
kWh to be applied in each region in each time period. These exact limits are set by Grid+ and
are functions of the total number of Grid+ customers and revenue in the given region. If more
customers sign up with Grid+ in a particular region, the limit to the periodic total redeemable

kWh for that region should also grow.

Note that a separate redemption smart contract exists for each region and for each electricity
provider (including Grid+ or any partner utility). The limits may vary depending on the utility

provider and might not be set by Grid+ for partner utilities.

Once the periodic limit is reached, customers will no longer be able to redeem GRID from the
user interface of any Grid+ application and the smart contract will stop accepting redemptions
until Grid+ resets it in the following time period. If a customer's agent attempts to redeem some
number of GRID that brings the total redemption past the threshold for that time period, the

smart contract will reject the transaction and the GRID will be returned to the agent.

41
Grid+ Whitepaper v2.0

All GRID redemptions must be performed by Grid+ customers, specifically by registered Grid+
agent devices. If GRID are sent to the redemption contract by any other party or by means of

any unregistered device, they have no utility on the Grid+ platform and may be forfeit.

5.3.3 Distribution of GRID

Of the 300,000,000 GRID tokens, 30% (90,000,000) will be sold in the upcoming token sale.
20% (60,000,000) will be held by the founders of Grid+; of these, 25% will remain time-locked
for each of 6, 12, and 18 months, with the final 25% also being unlocked after 18 months.
Another 20% (60,000,000) will be held by external owners of Grid+; these will be time-locked on
the same schedule and in the same percentages as the founders’ tokens. The remaining 30%
(90,000,000) will be held in treasury by Grid+. The GRID tokens in treasury will be used to
incentivize new customers to join Grid+ and/or in connection with partnership arrangements with
other utilities. In the event that a new customer is given GRID, those GRID will be automatically

redeemed by the customer's agent upon signing up for Grid+ service.

42
Grid+ Whitepaper v2.0

6 Business Model

In this section, we discuss the currently anticipated Grid+ business model. We believe our
model may be of general public interest, as it creates many efficiencies and will enhance the
public good. However, such discussion is for informational purposes only and is not intended as
an investment prospectus or similar document with respect to Grid+. The Grid+ business model
will be determined by Grid+ and its management team and will be subject to change from time
to time based on a variety of factors. Please note that GRID and BOLT are not intended to be
shares of stock or other securities, and persons who purchase GRID and/or BOLT will not
thereby be acquiring any right or entitlement to directly or indirectly share in the profits of Grid+

or to vote for, or participate in the management of, Grid+.

Grid+ revenue will be generated from markup on wholesale energy prices, transaction fees,
interest on capital backing BOLT tokens, and sales of Smart Agents. The objective of Grid+ is to
drive energy prices as low as possible and operate the energy business near-cost in the

long-term (i.e. paying for expenses, but making little-to-no profit off of the energy fees charged).

43
Grid+ Whitepaper v2.0

6.1 Markup on Energy

Grid+ expects to charge its customers for the price of energy they purchase in the wholesale
market, the fees associated with its distribution, as well as a percent markup over these latter
two costs. Figure 13 shows the average wholesale cost of electricity in Texas over time. Note

that in 2016 roughly half of the cost of residential electricity represented the markup by retailers.

Year

Figure 13: Wholesale vs Residential Pricing

Grid+ expects to charge 20% above the wholesale plus distribution cost implying a cost of
$0.068/kWh, for the Texas market, compared to the current average retail cost of $0.115/kWh.

This would provide a customer savings of ~38%.

The mandatory use of deposits by customers results in the complete removal of bad debt
expenses, which creates a competitive advantage over incumbent retailers. The deposit model
creates a somewhat hidden virtuous cycle. Customers who are likely to default on payments will
be unwilling to post a deposit and join the Grid+ platform. Thus, high credit risk customers are
pushed onto incumbent retailers, thereby increasing Grid+’s competitive advantage over time,

further facilitating the ability of Grid+ to build out its network.

44
Grid+ Whitepaper v2.0

6.2 Raiden Network Transaction Fees

Given its system design, Grid+ is poised to become one of the largest stable-coin issuing
entities on the public Ethereum network. Issuing large amounts of fiat tokens puts Grid+ in a
unique situation to act as a central bazaar for a great deal of commerce on the public Ethereum
network. Grid+ anticipates the ability to operate a large fiat hub on the Raiden network with a
significant amount of liquidity. With this hub established, Grid+ foresees a secondary revenue

source: charging fees on microtransactions inside the Grid+ Raiden hub.

These Raiden fees should not be conflated with Grid+ fees. The former is simply to pay for
using the Grid+ Raiden hub to conduct commerce (outside of Grid+), while the latter is a markup
on energy to pay for Grid+ costs. Note that no Raiden fees will be added to channels open for
Grid+ services (i.e. Grid+ will not have double-fees). Also note that Raiden fees, like all other

fees in Grid+, go to Karabraxos (which is intended to capture al/ revenue streams of Grid+).

Grid+ will work to capture market share in the early days of Raiden, rather than maximize short
term revenue generated through the hub. Therefore, the fees charged will be extremely low (on
the order of $0.0001 per tx). As of this writing, the average cost of a transaction on the Visa
network is 2% of the transaction cost + $0.10, thus for a $10 transaction, the fee would be
$0.30. Although one could argue that Grid+ only needs to beat Visa, the team believes it must
strive to beat the costs of the public Ethereum network as well. Currently, the median cost for a
simple transfer is $0.11 on the public Ethereum network.” Thus, the expected transfer fee for a
$10 payment in the Grid+ Raiden hub will be 0.033% the cost or the Visa transaction and 0.05%
of the public Ethereum transaction. This means Grid+ Raiden hub transactions will be
2,000-3,000 times less expensive than typical payment costs. It is not inconceivable that other
commerce will look to utilize BOLT inside of the Grid+ Raiden hub to capitalize on these

extremely low costs.

6.3 Interest on BOLT deposits

The fiat currency backing BOLT will be used by Grid+ to pay for the wholesale electricity when

BOLT is redeemed by a consumer for electricity. Note that any time fiat is used to pay for

Grid+ Whitepaper v2.0

wholesale electricity, a corresponding number of BOLT tokens will be burned within Karabraxos.
If not enough BOLT tokens can be burned, the number of BOLT to be burned will be recorded
and another burn event will be attempted after more fees have been collected. Any return

earned on the fiat currency backing BOLT tokens will be solely for the account of Grid+.

In the time period between when the consumer buys the BOLT and the electricity is consumed,
Grid+ will invest the monies in low-risk assets such as treasury bills. Assuming that US treasury
bills will yield 1% this will generate revenues of $272,000 - $544,000 per year during the Tesla
Epoch (Q2 2018- Q1 2019).

6.4 Sales of Smart Agents

All Grid+ customers will require a Smart Agent, whose estimated manufacturing cost is
anticipated to be near $50. This device will offer substantially more functionality than a Trezor”!
or Ledger” hardware device at a lower price point. Initially, Grid+ intends to sell Smart Agents at
cost, as they are the gateway to the Grid+ platform and will help drive customer acquisition and
the need for GRID tokens.

6.5 Roadmap

The Grid+ roadmap starts by assuming relatively low battery and solar penetration and focuses
primarily on developing the smart-energy agent and its software as well as rolling out utilities in

targeted regions. In later phases, Grid+ will assume higher DER penetration.

6.5.1 Phase 1: Edison Epoch (Q4 2017 - Q3 2018)

During this period, Grid+ will establish a single utility in a targeted region and sign up 5,000+
customers. These customers may be given GRID in promotional events which will be
automatically redeemed for the right to purchase wholesale electricity. This will also be a period

of rapid improvement to Grid+ software and hardware components.

6.5.1.1 First Utility

Grid+ will begin the Edison Epoch by applying for creation of a utility in a deregulated market
within the United States. At the time of writing this, no market has been selected, but the target

markets have been narrowed down to a short list.

"Trezor, https://trezor.io/
” edger, https:/Awww.ledgerwallet.com/

46
Grid+ Whitepaper v2.0

Grid+ will need to contract with a marketer who is familiar with marketing utilities. This sounds
like a specialised task, but it is a fairly common skill in deregulated, competitive markets

(because the churn rate is fairly high for utilities).

6.5.1.2 Smart Agent Prototype

Before developing the software, Grid+ will need a stable hardware prototype of the Smart Agent
to ensure the development environment will remain constant. This prototype should come from
a production process that is at least scalable to a few thousand devices, but need not be

scalable to millions.

During this phase Grid+ will hire three hardware engineers to finalize the first production

hardware device. Karl Kreder will oversee the Smart Agent prototyping, testing, and production.

6.5.1.3 Establish Content Delivery Network

Before making upgrades to the Smart Agent client”, Grid+ needs to establish a process in
which the Smart Agent fetches updates from the hub. This is critical to streamlining upgrades
and enabling fast iteration. The software team, led by Alex Miller, will spend much of this phase
developing a content delivery network (CDN) - this will mostly be on the server side. The
software team will also build the plumbing (remote logging, updates, etc.) for the client to

operate in whatever Smart Agent environment is chosen.

6.5.1.4 Updates to the Client

The Edison phase will see rapid development in the client. Grid+ will hire two additional software
engineers, primarily for development of the client. This client will have bare minimum

functionality (signup, open payment channels, withdrawals).

The software team will also spend more time on the REST API of the Grid+ hub, which will be
similarly limited in functionality. The end of this phase will be marked by a v1.0 release on the

releases page” of the Grid+ client.

™ Grid+ Client, Releases, https://github.com/GridPlus/client/releases

47
Grid+ Whitepaper v2.0

6.5.2 Phase 2: Tesla Epoch (Q4 2018 - Q3 2019)

During this period, Grid+ plans to acquire 100,000-200,000 customers in 2-4 markets and will
increase the liquidity of the BOLT token by decreasing transaction fees through the

establishment of a Raiden hub.

6.5.2.1 Scalable Hardware Production

After reaching a v1.0 of the Grid+ Smart Agent client, Grid+ will establish an improved
production process for the hardware. This process will need to scale to 100,000 devices and will
require at least two full time manufacturing engineers to ensure Grid+ can meet production

quotas.

6.5.2.2 More Utilities

During the Tesla phase Grid+ will create 1-3 more utilities in targeted regions. This will ensure
the process to create utilities is scalable. Long term, Grid+ hopes to open many utilities
worldwide, and this is only possible if with a sufficiently streamlined expansion process. Grid+
will need to contract with several more marketers who are familiar with the respective local

regions.

6.5.2.3 Raiden Hub

Once Grid+ has acquired a sufficient number of customers, it will begin utilizing BOLT liquidity
(BOLTs are only created when customers make deposits) by establishing a Raiden hub. This is
both to introduce a new revenue stream (from generalized state channel fees) and also to make

Grid+ more efficient (migrating simple, custom payment channels to the Raiden network).

This will make Grid+ a prominent hub for stable token (USD) commerce. This will be a big step

in facilitating mass adoption of the Ethereum network for payments.

Alex Miller will oversee the software team’s phased migration to the Raiden hub. Grid+ will bring
in subject-matter expertise from ConsenSys to assist in making a smooth transition. This is one
of the biggest advantages of being a ConsenSys Formation - Grid+ will have continued access

to some of the best developers in the Ethereum ecosystem.

48
Grid+ Whitepaper v2.0

6.5.2.4 Better Decisions from More APIs

During this phase, Grid+ will allow optional API data feeds to send encrypted information to the
Smart Agent. This will allow better decision-making and more efficient energy usage. Grid+ will
need to scale its software team to develop the client, expand the API, create an SDK, and make

the web system more scalable.

The Tesla Epoch will be marked by a v2.0 release of the Grid+ client.

6.5.3 Phase 3: Musk Epoch (Q4 2019 and beyond)

This will be the final of the first three phases, during which Grid+ will globally expand its utilities
network and sign up many more customers. At this point, Grid+ must have a scalable process in

place to facilitate this expansion.

6.5.3.1 Full Hardware Production Scalability

During this phase Grid+ will need to establish a production process to allow for millions of
devices to be manufactured. This must be extremely scalable and will require a large ramp-up in
hiring hardware engineers and process managers. Because Grid+ will likely need to contract
with multiple hardware manufacturers, it is important for the Smart Agent to be built from

sufficiently commoditized parts.

6.5.3.2 Smart Agent Al Optimization

With the client software at v2, Grid+ will now dedicate much of its software development time to
optimizing Smart Agent decision-making by designing better artificial intelligence to leverage
incoming API data from sufficiently abstracted data feeds. This will require scaling the software
team to include data scientists and Al experts. This will likely happen in several stages and at

that time Grid+ will likely draft an updated roadmap.

6.5.3.3 International Utilities Expansion

While Grid+ will be forming many more utilities in the U.S., it will also look to expand globally in
targeted regions. This will require growth of the strategy team, which is overseen by Mark

D’Agostino.

49
Grid+ Whitepaper v2.0

6.6 Use of Funds

GRID tokens may be purchased from Grid+ using ether. Grid+ will be exposed to fluctuations in
value between ether and other fiat currencies until Grid+ develops a significant stream of fiat
currency-based revenue, as almost all of the expenses of Grid+ will be denominated in USD
and other fiat currencies. As GRID tokens represent the right to receive power delivered to a
customer of Grid+ (or a licensee), the proceeds from the sale of GRID tokens will solely be
property of Grid+ and Grid+ will have no obligation to return any of these proceeds if the Grid+

network is not developed as anticipated in this Whitepaper.

Funds from the token sale will be used by Grid+ in several ways over several Epochs detailed in
the roadmap. (Figures 14-16) It is currently estimated that Grid+ will spend ~$12mm through the
Edison Epoch, $36mm during the Tesla Epoch, and $52mm during the Musk Epoch. While
building a hardware and software product, Grid+ will also be required to put down deposits in
fiat currency in order to form utilities in every region of operation. Once a Raiden hub is
established, Grid+ will likely convert much of its ether to BOLT tokens in order to increase
liquidity for stable coin commerce. However, it will also maintain ether liquidity in the same
Raiden hub. As various revenue streams start to come on line, Grid+ will also have access to
these funds to develop and implement its business plan. If Grid+ has excess funds after setting
up retailers in all targeted deregulated markets, it will increase both ether and BOLT liquidity in

ts Raiden hub.

6.6.1 Forming Utilities

It is contemplated that a plurality of ether accepted will go toward forming retailers in specifically
identified deregulated markets. The first utilities will likely be in Texas, California, and New
England. There are many factors that go into this decision, but the most significant ones are
smart-meter penetration, regulatory friendliness, and price of electricity - higher prices means
more room for competition (Figure 17). After starting in the US, Grid+ will seek to expand
internationally to strategic regions. Right now, the best candidates are Australia, Germany and

the UK but there are many other possibilities.

The creation of a retailer requires a large deposit, which sits in escrow. This number is greater
than $1 million for many regions. It is important to reiterate that these funds are not be “spent”,

but rather deposited.

6.6.2 Legal Work

Grid+ has been working closely with Matt Corva, general counsel for ConsenSys. Matt has
intimate knowledge when it comes to the tokenized ecosystem in Ethereum, having worked
closely alongside Coinbase to draft “A Securities Law Framework for Blockchain Tokens”.”° Matt
also led all of the legal work for the Gnosis team, along with top global law firms, to structure
their two-token utility system in a legally compliant manner. Matt plans to help put together a
legal team and provide guidance for Grid+ as it expands operations to ensure Grid+ is always

compliant with all laws pertinent to the jurisdictions in which it operates.

Grid+ Whitepaper v2.0

6.6.3 Marketing

In the short term, Grid+ plans to spend a relatively large amount on marketing to acquire its
initial customer base. Grid+ will advertise in a highly targeted geographic region and to a highly
targeted demographic. As the brand gains more notoriety, Grid+ will move to minimal

marketing/advertising and will let its low energy prices speak for themselves.

Many reading this white paper can attest to the evangelistic effects of a tokenized economy.
Grid+ imagines GRID token holder-evangelists will do a better job marketing the Grid+ platform
than Grid+ can do on its own. Even those who are not GRID holders, but are Ethereum
enthusiasts, will help push the platform because Grid+ uses the Ethereum rails from start to
finish. Adoption of Grid+ by definition means adoption for public Ethereum. Grid+ foresees a

grassroots viral marketing craze propelling Grid+ into mainstream media.

6.6.4 Product

The final area where Grid+ plans to deploy substantial resources is in the further development
of the Grid+ system. Grid+ has a working demo application and has prototyped the hardware
product, but this will be an iterative process to create and test. Grid+ will need to grow its team
and bring together hardware specialists, software engineers, and Ethereum experts to ensure it

can build a safe, reliable, and desirable Smart Agent.

Grid+ Whitepaper v2.0

7 Experience and Team

Prior to the advent of the Frontier’”’ deployment of the Ethereum public chain on July 30th 2015,
ConsenSys had already been building and testing applications for the energy ecosystem. The
first project began in May of 2015, which was a ConsenSys-led joint venture to construct the
TransactiveGrid.”” Championed by ConsenSys Enterprise partner John Lilic and senior
technologist Dr. Christian Lundkvisk, the TransactiveGrid proved that electrical energy could be

tokenized on Ethereum and transacted across a distributed network.

Through the Brooklyn TransactiveGrid project of 2015, ConsenSys came to the realization that
the public Ethereum blockchain infrastructure was seriously deficient, and thus discontinued the
project in 2016. Since then, the ecosystem has experienced rapid growth in developer
infrastructure. Tools such as Truffle”, MetaMask®, INFURA®', and MyEtherWallet® allow

developers to rapidly prototype Ethereum applications and seamlessly integrate them into the

user’s browser.

Since the TransactiveGrid, the ConsenSys Energy team has been engaged in a number of
projects with various utilities around the world. ConsenSys began joint development on a
platform called Co-tricity®> alongside RWE Group™, which was recently rebranded as Innogy.®
This joint development helped validate assumptions about the energy markets and
demonstrated the expanded roles utilities can play in a world with decentralized grid

infrastructure.

For the past 12 months, the ConsenSys Energy and Enterprise teams have serviced multiple
Fortune Global 50 Energy companies. ConsenSys has built models akin to the TransactiveGrid,
albeit utilizing much more scalable design patterns. During these pilot projects ConsenSys
developed two fully decentralized exchanges, one using a continuous auction model and the
other using batch/uniform pricing. ConsenSys also explored the intersection of loT and
Ethereum, giving smart-batteries the ability to utilize ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature
Algorithm), specifically the secp256k1 curve, by signing and broadcasting Ethereum
transactions on behalf of their owners. One Enterprise project, which involves swarms of smart
batteries, is currently in the pilot phase with code running in a production environment in the

homes of select participants in Europe.

The ConsenSys Enterprise group lives by the modus operandi of ‘customer led development’.
This ensures that ConsenSys enters engagements with open minds and that it learns from its
clients, who are the true subject matter experts in their industries. Many startups, especially
those in the blockchain ecosystem, fail to achieve increased efficiency by naively applying new
technology to existing industry processes. ConsenSys brings Ethereum expertise to industry
leaders and learns from their experiences. ConsenSys has spent two years working with some
of the brightest minds in the energy space, which has culminated in the formation of Gridt+. The
Grid+ team leverages experience from other ConsenSys teams, Ethereum startups, and
massive Fortune Global 50 energy companies to design a system that will fundamentally

change the way consumers interact with their energy providers.
